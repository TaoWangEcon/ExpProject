Full text:   PARIS -- The European Central Bank left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at a record low on Wednesday, but indicated it was ready to take steps if needed to protect the euro zone from political turmoil in the United States.
"The U.S. budget shutdown is a risk if protracted," Mario Draghi, the central bank president, said at a news conference. But he added that he did not expect the two-day-old shutdown to last long.
Mr. Draghi deflected a question about what would happen if the United States defaulted on its debt because of the deadlock in Washington. He emphasized, though, that the bank was poised to intervene if needed.
"We have a vast array of instruments," Mr. Draghi said. "And we exclude no option."
But no immediate moves were announced. Meeting in Paris, the central bank's governing council kept its main interest rate at 0.5 percent, where it has been since May.
In his news conference, Mr. Draghi repeated his assurance that the central bank would continue holding rates down, citing continued low inflation. He said the governing council had discussed a rate cut but remained divided on whether one was warranted.
Although the euro common currency is no longer under siege, tension in the euro zone has risen in recent weeks. There had been questions about the survival of the Italian government before Wednesday, when the opposition leader, Silvio Berlusconi, said he would support the government of Prime Minister Enrico Letta in a vote of confidence.
But the partial shutdown of the American government, depending on how long it continues, could undercut demand from the United States, the euro zone's most important trading partner. Moreover, the political impasse in Washington raises the risk that the United States will hit the debt ceiling and begin defaulting on its debt. Analysts agree a default would be catastrophic for the world economy.
The euro zone has emerged from a recession that lasted a year and a half, but it is a feeble recovery that could easily be derailed by an external shock. "We view this recovery as weak, as fragile, as uneven," Mr. Draghi said.
Europe has also been affected in recent months by expectations that the Federal Reserve in Washington would soon begin reducing its economic stimulus program -- a move that, when it comes, is likely to push up market interest rates at a time when many European countries are experiencing severe shortages of credit.
Last week, Mr. Draghi said the European Central Bank would consider a fresh installment of unlimited three-year loans to banks at the rock-bottom official interest rate. The low-cost loans are the closest thing that the European Central Bank has to the "quantitative easing" employed by the Fed, and it helps make sure that banks have plenty of cash. On Wednesday, though, Mr. Draghi declined to be specific about when such a move might be coming.
A government shutdown in the United States affects Europe because it unsettles financial markets, and because it reduces demand in the American market that is crucial for European exports -- everything from Italian Ferraris to French cosmetics.
"While the direct economic damage will probably be limited if government offices will be allowed to resume business after a couple of days, the political standoff will take its toll on sentiment," Asoka Wöhrmann, co-chief investment officer of Deutsche Asset and Wealth Management in Frankfurt, said in an e-mail. "It is a bad harbinger for the upcoming -- and potentially more serious -- debt ceiling decision" in Washington.
In addition, the shutdown could weaken the dollar. That tends to hurt European exporters because their products become more expensive in dollar terms and have a more difficult time competing in the United States or other foreign markets. On Wednesday, prompted in part by Mr. Draghi's resolve to keep rates low, the euro rallied to its highest level against the dollar since February, reaching a peak of $1.3606.
The European Central Bank has plenty of room to maneuver on monetary policy. Annual inflation in the euro zone fell to 1.1 percent in September, its lowest level in three and a half years and well below the bank's target of about 2 percent.
The central bank is sworn to defend price stability above all else, and in theory it should be considering ways to increase inflation slightly. There remains a risk, however slight, that the euro zone could experience deflation, a broad decline in prices that undercuts corporate profits and investment and is associated with economic depression. Deflation can be more destructive than inflation, because it is very hard to reverse.
Mr. Draghi said inflation was in line with expectations and gave no indication the central bank was pondering measures to push inflation higher. "Inflation expectations for the euro area remain firmly anchored," he said.

Abstract: If China's official numbers are to be believed, there are provinces in China where the G.D.P. has been growing faster than energy use. That is unlikely, since the central government's statistics also say that energy use per unit of G.D.P. is going up -- not down, as claimed in provincial G.D.P. statistics. Now project the two growth rates forward: the inflation-adjusted per-capita G.D.P. of China would be less than $40,000 in 2100, versus almost $650,000 in the United States. That's because China starts at $1,000 per capita and the United States at $43,000. If, in 2100, China has four times as many people as the United States, as it does now, China would still not have a total G.D.P. equal to America's. it is unlikely to have four times as many people. It is always a mistake to project population growth rates for a century, but let's do it anyway: With a one-child policy and a sex ratio that favors boys (many men won't find wives) -- China should experience a decline in population in the 21st century. Yet let's assume for a moment that China's population remains constant, at 1.3 billion. If immigration to the United States continued at the current rate, America's population would rise. If the population grew at 1 percent a year, as it has recently, it would more than double by 2100, reducing the enormous population gap between the two countries. Are these projections likely to be realized? Who knows?

Full text: AuthorAffiliation Lester Thurow is a professor of management and economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He is also on the board of Taiwan Semiconductor, which does business in mainland China.
CHINA claims that its economy is growing at 10 to 11 percent a year, and China's official analysts say that their nation will catch up with the United States long before the 22nd century arrives. Don't believe it.
First, let's deal with the implausibility of the official Chinese statistics. Mathematically, if the overall economy were to grow 10 percent annually, and the 70 percent of the economy that is based in rural areas were not growing (as stated by the Chinese government), the economy in China's cities would have to be growing by 33 percent a year. The urban economy is growing rapidly, but not at a 33 percent pace.


Furthermore, Chinese statistics conflict with those of Hong Kong, the semiautonomous territory that serves as the financial capital of much of southern China. In 2001, Hong Kong had a recession, which is to say that it reported that its gross domestic product fell. Guangdong, the adjacent Chinese province, has a population of around 200 million. In 2001, it reported that its G.D.P. grew by 10 percent. What are the chances that both of those numbers are correct? Very slim.
Economic growth rates can be inferred from electricity consumption. In every country in the world, electricity use has generally grown faster than the G.D.P. Electricity is necessary for nearly all productive activities, and because of inefficiencies, consumption of electricity has generally outstripped economic growth. Rising energy costs have resulted in more efficient use of electricity, but especially in the developing world, economic growth has still generally lagged growth in electricity.
But if China's official numbers are to be believed, there are provinces in China where the G.D.P. has been growing faster than energy use. That is unlikely, since the central government's statistics also say that energy use per unit of G.D.P. is going up -- not down, as claimed in provincial G.D.P. statistics.
Among the world's 12 most rapidly growing economies over the last 10 years, the G.D.P. has grown only 45 percent as fast as electricity consumption. In the early 1970s, Japan was shutting down its electricity-guzzling aluminum industry. During this period, the G.D.P. grew 60 percent as fast as electricity consumption, the highest recorded level among industrialized nations.
Using those numbers as a guide, if we consider China's actual electrical use, which is relatively easy to measure, and do a little math, we come up with this estimate: The G.D.P. in China has been growing somewhere between 4.5 percent (using the average for a rapidly growing country) to 6 percent a year (using the highest rate for Japan), not at the 10 percent rate claimed in official statistics.
The official statistic for China's overall growth rate is best regarded as an approximate growth rate of the economy of its cities.
China also officially claims that it will catch up with the United States and become the world's largest economy well before the 22nd century arrives.
There is an equally simple reason that neither of these predictions is likely to be realized. It simply takes more than 100 years for a large, less economically developed country to catch up with the world leader in per capita income. One need look only at the history of the United States, which had a much higher growth rate than Britain in the 19th century, yet did not catch up until World War I. Or consider Japan and the United States. Some 150 years after Japan started to modernize during the Meiji restoration, the country's per capita G.D.P. is still only 80 percent of that of the United States in terms of purchasing power parity -- although, in nominal terms, it has caught up.
The United States is not standing still. In fact, its per capita income grew faster than nearly all other big countries from 1990 to 2007. Europe's per capita income fell from 85 percent of that of the United States in 1990 to 66 percent in 2007, according to International Monetary Fund statistics.
So let's say that the inflation-adjusted growth rate for China is 4 percent a year. This is optimistic, because China will certainly have some bad years in the next century. Every country does -- remember the Great Depression in the United States. A 4 percent rate is faster than any big country has ever grown for 100 years. But assume that China can do it. Assume, too, that America grows at the 3 percent rate it has averaged for the last 15 years.
Now project the two growth rates forward: the inflation-adjusted per-capita G.D.P. of China would be less than $40,000 in 2100, versus almost $650,000 in the United States. That's because China starts at $1,000 per capita and the United States at $43,000. If, in 2100, China has four times as many people as the United States, as it does now, China would still not have a total G.D.P. equal to America's.
But it is unlikely to have four times as many people. It is always a mistake to project population growth rates for a century, but let's do it anyway: With a one-child policy and a sex ratio that favors boys (many men won't find wives) -- China should experience a decline in population in the 21st century. Yet let's assume for a moment that China's population remains constant, at 1.3 billion. If immigration to the United States continued at the current rate, America's population would rise. If the population grew at 1 percent a year, as it has recently, it would more than double by 2100, reducing the enormous population gap between the two countries. Are these projections likely to be realized? Who knows?
What is clear is that China is unlikely to surpass the United States in G.D.P. in absolute or relative terms anytime soon.
There may be a Chinese century, but it will be the 22nd century -- not the 21st.

Abstract: In the United States, the Federal Reserve said last month that inflation remained the ''predominant'' risk for the economy. It kept the benchmark United States interest rate at 5.25 percent and said that while inflation readings had improved modestly, a ''sustained moderation in inflation pressures has yet to be convincingly demonstrated.'' ''The increase was no surprise,'' said Philip Shaw, an economist at Investec in London, who wonders whether rates have peaked. ''Rates have probably peaked, but there's clearly a risk that if a slowdown doesn't happen we'll see another increase.'' Rachel Lomax, deputy governor for the Bank of England, and some economists called for patience, saying that the effects of previous increases would trickle through and that a further rate increase after Thursday's could tip the scale. Ms. Lomax said last week that policy makers should be cautious of ''overdoing it.''

Full text: The Bank of England raised interest rates Thursday for the fifth time in a little less than a year, and the president of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, hinted at a possible rate increase later this year as policy makers around the world respond to the threat of accelerating inflation.
The Bank of England raised its key rate by a quarter-point, to 5.75 percent, the highest it has been in six years, citing concern that inflation would stay above the bank's 2 percent target.


The European Central Bank left its benchmark interest rate at 4 percent. But Mr. Trichet said he had ''no intention to change in any respect the present expectations of the market'' for another rate increase in September or October.
As part of a long, slow process of normalizing borrowing costs from historic lows, the European Central Bank's key rate has doubled since it began raising rates in December 2004.
In the United States, the Federal Reserve said last month that inflation remained the ''predominant'' risk for the economy. It kept the benchmark United States interest rate at 5.25 percent and said that while inflation readings had improved modestly, a ''sustained moderation in inflation pressures has yet to be convincingly demonstrated.''
The Bank of England's rate rise sent the pound, which had gained against the dollar in the days before the announcement, to $2.02 -- close to a 26-year high. It fell to $2.0123 Thursday.
Financial markets expected the rate increase because minutes of the bank's committee meeting last month revealed that Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England, was overruled in a 5-to-4 vote that decided against a rate increase.
''The increase was no surprise,'' said Philip Shaw, an economist at Investec in London, who wonders whether rates have peaked. ''Rates have probably peaked, but there's clearly a risk that if a slowdown doesn't happen we'll see another increase.''
The bank's previous rate increases have had only limited effects so far. House prices in Britain are still increasing and the country's booming financial services industry has contributed to the fastest economic growth in Britain in three years.
British inflation rose unexpectedly to 3.1 percent in March, the highest since January 1997, and some economists, including James Knightley at ING Wholesale Banking in London, predicted interest rates would reach 6 percent this year.
Rachel Lomax, deputy governor for the Bank of England, and some economists called for patience, saying that the effects of previous increases would trickle through and that a further rate increase after Thursday's could tip the scale. Ms. Lomax said last week that policy makers should be cautious of ''overdoing it.''
Higher rates have already started to weigh on British households, which are struggling to repay their mortgages.
The latest rate increase will add about $:30 a month ($60) to repayments on an average 25-year mortgage of $:200,000.
British homeowners are spending the highest share of their income on mortgage payments in 15 years, according to the Council of Mortgage Lenders.
Some mortgage lenders have started to offer a sale-and-rent-back option in which distressed homeowners can sell their houses, usually at a lower price, and start renting them to avoid repossession.
Alistair Darling, the new chancellor of the Exchequer, told The Financial Times on Wednesday that he was concerned about mortgage payers' facing higher repayment costs.

Latest Consumer Price Data Ease Fears of Inflation

Abstract: For the Fed, which has bet that a slowing economy would temper inflation, the latest numbers appear to bolster its decision to keep interest rates steady. The central bank on Tuesday kept rates unchanged at 5.25 percent for the fourth consecutive time, and gave its clearest nod yet to emerging soft spots in the economy. For the first time in four years, wages are significantly outpacing inflation. A separate Labor Department report yesterday showed that while wage gains have slowed slightly in the last month, workers are still enjoying the strongest buying power in years. When adjusted for inflation, the average hourly wage of a worker in a position below management level rose 2.3 percent. November was the third consecutive month that wages rose at more than 2 percent when inflation is factored in, the first time that has happened in five years. Not all economists are convinced, however, that the recent rise in wages threatens to push inflation back up. Jared Bernstein, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute, said when inflation was not taken into account, wages had increased about the same year-over-year rate since this summer.

Full text: The latest report on consumer prices showed that inflation was following an arc that must give some relief to the Federal Reserve.
Prices fell last month on everything from a gallon of gasoline to fresh vegetables and children's clothing, helping to contain the overall rate of inflation at zero, the Labor Department reported yesterday.
The core inflation rate, a measure closely watched by the Fed because it excludes the volatile prices of food and energy, was also zero.
For the Fed, which has bet that a slowing economy would temper inflation, the latest numbers appear to bolster its decision to keep interest rates steady. The central bank on Tuesday kept rates unchanged at 5.25 percent for the fourth consecutive time, and gave its clearest nod yet to emerging soft spots in the economy.
The government reported separately yesterday that industrial production -- a measure of output at the nation's factories, mines and utilities -- was essentially flat from October through November.
''The inflation scare of 2006 is over,'' Kenneth Beauchemin, a United States economist with Global Insight, said in a research note. ''Much credit belongs to the Fed.''
Stagnant prices combined with stunted economic growth make it less likely that the Fed will increase interest rates early next year.
Wall Street also appeared to think so, and investors propelled shares to new highs yesterday. The benchmark Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and the Dow Jones industrial average both closed at record levels.
Resurgent inflation could still spoil the trend of calm price increases, particularly if gas prices spike or employers start passing on the cost of rising wages to consumers.
''Don't get too carried away,'' said Ken Matheny, senior economist with Macroeconomic Advisers.
He said the news should ease the Fed's concerns. ''But I wouldn't go too far,'' he added. ''It doesn't establish a new reality.''
Though prices have steadied since the summer, the core inflation rate for the year remains at 2.6 percent, well above the 2 percent that the Fed has said it considers healthy.
While yesterday's figures suggest that the economy is gently gliding into a period when prices will be tame and growth steady, economists dispute just how orderly the decline in growth will be and how much prices will fall.
On the one hand, the price deceleration has been broad-based. Just as the cost of gasoline was responsible for much of the run-up in prices earlier this year, falling fuel prices have brought down inflation. In addition, prices either fell or barely increased last month in most of the major categories that the government surveys for the consumer price index. Fruit and vegetable prices tumbled along with prices for airline tickets, automobiles and prescription drugs.
But the cost of housing climbed last month, reflecting the higher cost of natural gas and other utilities.
The price of oil, always a volatile economic force, is one of the wild cards. In fact, OPEC said Thursday that it planned to reduce its output quotas by 2 percent in February, a move intended to keep crude oil prices elevated next year. Oil prices closed up almost a dollar yesterday at $63.43 a barrel.
The other wild card is labor costs. Economists cautioned that rising wages could pressure businesses to raise prices in the months ahead.
''People have been expressing a lot of relief over declining energy prices while seeming to neglect the rise in labor costs,'' Richard F. Moody, chief economist with Mission Residential, a real estate investment firm. ''Now with oil over $60 a barrel, it looks like it could be both energy costs and labor costs.''
For the first time in four years, wages are significantly outpacing inflation. A separate Labor Department report yesterday showed that while wage gains have slowed slightly in the last month, workers are still enjoying the strongest buying power in years. When adjusted for inflation, the average hourly wage of a worker in a position below management level rose 2.3 percent. November was the third consecutive month that wages rose at more than 2 percent when inflation is factored in, the first time that has happened in five years.
Not all economists are convinced, however, that the recent rise in wages threatens to push inflation back up. Jared Bernstein, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute, said when inflation was not taken into account, wages had increased about the same year-over-year rate since this summer.
''Inflation hawks are always going to look to the phantom menace of labor costs,'' he said. ''What real wage growth we've achieved has come from slower price growth. And that's been a long time in coming. Don't stop the party just when the working class gets there.''

Abstract: In practice, the Fed has achieved only one true soft landing -- in 1994-95, when, under the leadership of Alan Greenspan, it was able to slow the economy enough to cool spending and ease inflation pressure but not so much as to cause a big jump in unemployment. But even Mr. Greenspan, whose ability to fine-tune policy made him famous, presided over two formal recessions, in 1991 and in 2001. Mr. [Ben S. Bernanke] and other Fed officials say they want to keep core inflation, the main measure of retail prices excluding energy and food, below 2 percent a year. But core inflation is already 2.9 percent and almost certain to climb as the cost of oil pushes up prices for items as diverse as air fares and plastics. He is not alone. Many other economists contend that inflation is more entrenched and will be more painful to reverse than the Fed thinks. Others predict that inflation will indeed subside, but only because the economy will weaken much more than the Fed is expecting.

Full text: In the cool and quiet marble corridors of the Federal Reserve, the strategy for taming inflation sounds painless, even soothing: a ''soft landing'' for the economy after several years of flying high.
As the central bank contended on Tuesday, when it decided to pause in its two-year effort to raise interest rates, inflation is ''elevated'' right now but will begin to decline because economic growth is poised for a modest slowdown.
Many economists, though, warn that the soft landing may seem anything but soft, and suggest that the Fed is either too rosy about the looming slowdown or naive about the difficulty of reaching its goal for inflation.
In practice, the Fed has achieved only one true soft landing -- in 1994-95, when, under the leadership of Alan Greenspan, it was able to slow the economy enough to cool spending and ease inflation pressure but not so much as to cause a big jump in unemployment. But even Mr. Greenspan, whose ability to fine-tune policy made him famous, presided over two formal recessions, in 1991 and in 2001.
This time, many analysts say that the Fed and its new chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, face considerably tougher challenges. Crude oil, at more than $70 a barrel, is selling at prices that would have been unthinkable in 1995. Productivity growth, which was accelerating in 1995, is slowing these days. The dollar, which was climbing against other major currencies in 1995, is declining against most of them now.
Analysts and other experts say that if Mr. Bernanke is serious about his goals for controlling inflation, at least two million more workers may have to lose their jobs over the next two years.
''The economic slowdown has to be much more substantial than anybody in the Federal Reserve or on Wall Street is expecting,'' said Robert J. Gordon, a professor of economics at Northwestern University, who has analyzed the trade-off between inflation and unemployment for the last several decades.
Mr. Bernanke and other Fed officials say they want to keep core inflation, the main measure of retail prices excluding energy and food, below 2 percent a year. But core inflation is already 2.9 percent and almost certain to climb as the cost of oil pushes up prices for items as diverse as air fares and plastics.
Mr. Gordon said the last few decades had shown a grim but consistent trade-off: to reduce inflation by one percentage point, the unemployment rate has to rise by about two percentage points for a full year.
To reduce inflation to the upper limits of what Mr. Bernanke and other Fed officials consider acceptable, more than three million jobs would be lost, a bigger drop than in the recession of 2001.
And that is Mr. Gordon's relatively upbeat hypothesis, which assumes no other shocks to the economy -- no additional increases in energy prices, no collapse in the dollar's value, no collapse in housing.
''I think the Fed is facing an absolutely classic case of stagflation,'' Mr. Gordon said, ''a situation in which they cannot win.''
He is not alone. Many other economists contend that inflation is more entrenched and will be more painful to reverse than the Fed thinks. Others predict that inflation will indeed subside, but only because the economy will weaken much more than the Fed is expecting.
The chief forecaster at Decision Economics, Allen Sinai, said unemployment would have to rise to at least 5.5 percent, from 4.8 percent today, putting a million more people out of work, before inflation begins to decline.
The chairman of Roubini Global Economics Monitor, Nouriel Roubini, predicted that the economy would fall into a recession early in 2007 as a result of high energy prices, higher interest rates and a housing collapse.
''Either the Fed does not believe its own inflation forecast, which I don't think is the case,'' Mr. Roubini said, ''or the slowdown is going to be greater than what they have been saying. They can't have it both ways.''
To be sure, economists differ on how weak the economy already is or how severe inflation pressure is. And skepticism abounds on the chances of achieving a true soft landing.
The very idea of such a thing is only about a decade old. It was conceived by Mr. Greenspan, then the Fed chairman, as a way to attack inflation before it started, by shrewdly using the levers of monetary policy to slow the economy just enough to keep it from overheating.
Mr. Greenspan's greatest success was in the mid-1990's, when the economy had been expanding for nearly four years. Though inflation was declining and was lower than it is today, the Fed doubled short-term interest rates, to 6 percent from 3 percent, in just over a year.
At the time, the result seemed neither soft nor smooth. Several financial institutions, caught by surprise, found themselves in big trouble. The economy slowed for a while, and unemployment edged up.
But by 1996, the economy was rapidly growing again and the nation enjoyed several years of booming stock markets, falling unemployment and relatively low inflation.
The success, along with Mr. Greenspan's growing aura as a wizard of monetary nimbleness, prompted the Fed to step in and help soften the blows of the Asian financial crisis of 1997-98, the stock market collapse of 2000, the recession of 2001 and the surge of unemployment that followed.
He failed in preventing the 2001 recession, but the Fed cut interest rates so deeply that this started a boom in housing prices and home refinancing that kept consumers spending even as incomes stagnated and unemployment moved higher.
Laurence H. Meyer, a former Fed governor and now a chief forecaster at Macroeconomic Advisers, said Mr. Bernanke needed to do more than simply duplicate Mr. Greenspan's one soft landing.
Mr. Greenspan was not trying to reduce inflation, but merely to keep it from going up. Mr. Bernanke, by contrast, is trying to reduce it substantially.
''Soft landings are much more frequent in forecasts than in real life,'' Mr. Meyer said. ''With a computer, I can give you a soft landing if you give me 10 or 20 runs. But in real life, you only have one run.''
Uncertainties and disagreement among experts about the economy's direction are now unusually high. A big uncertainty is whether the nation is near full employment.
Many economists contend that the country is essentially at full employment, meaning that additional demand for workers will tend to push up wages. Because wages account for more than three-quarters of total production costs, Fed officials view them as inflationary if they rise significantly faster than productivity.
Specialists like Mr. Gordon at Northwestern and Mr. Meyer maintain that the labor market is already very tight and predict that wages will soon start to push up inflation.
But others disagree, arguing that wages over the last five years have lagged behind increases in productivity and have barely kept up with inflation. The bigger risk, according to that school of thought, is to make the situation worse by driving up unemployment.
''We have no clue about labor market tightness right now,'' said J. Bradford De Long, a professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley, who argues that workers still have little bargaining power.
Depending on one's perspective, Mr. De Long said, the Fed's attempt at a soft landing is either a display of cool-headed technocracy or murky witchcraft.
Right now, he said, ''this is on the witchcraft side.''

Abstract: Mr. [David Bowers] follows the predilections of big global institutional investors through Merrill Lynch's monthly survey of fund managers, which covers about 300 institutional investors who together manage about $1 trillion. The ability to raise prices with increasing inflation makes the earnings potential of economically sensitive stocks, which do well in periods of growth, even more attractive. There are more such stocks and companies outside the United States, Mr. Bowers said. MR. BOWERS warned that money managers could now be shifting their sights back to the United States as inflation worries have subsided. The 28 percent net underweighting of American stocks in the June survey, while significant, was down from 32 percent in May and 43 percent in April.

Full text: AS the stock market makes its second attempt this year to break out of the doldrums, investors who have stuck with American equities may be feeling a little better. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index had its highest close in more than four years on Friday, while the Dow Jones industrial average is now just 360 points from a return to 11,000.
But just a quick glance at the performance of stock markets worldwide will make these investors painfully aware that their counterparts abroad are doing much, much better. Although the United States economy is outperforming that of a good portion of the rest of the world, the stock market isn't.
''We are talking about the global economy slowing down, but their stock markets are going up,'' said James W. Paulsen, chief investment officer at Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis.
What may make American investors feel even worse is that they have been denied most of the good performance in international markets because of the sudden rally in the dollar -- except against a few emerging-market currencies like those of Mexico and Brazil.
The dollar is not likely to weaken much very soon, said Paresh Upadhyaya, a portfolio manager at Putnam Investments. He said his quantitative guideposts remained positive across the board for the dollar.
But while global investors still seem to favor stocks outside the United States, the trend could be shifting. And that would be good for American investors who decided to stay home.
The S.&P. 500 is now up 1.3 percent for the year, but the FTSE 100 index in Britain is up 8.7 percent, in pounds. It reached a 38-month high last Thursday, just five trading days after the terrorist bombings in London. (In dollar terms, that gain becomes a loss of 0.6 percent.)
Other foreign markets are also doing well. While the Dow is still down 1.3 percent for the year, the S.&P. ASX 200 index in Australia is up 6 percent in Australian dollars (1.4 percent in American dollars). Even the Nikkei 225 is up 2.4 percent, in Japanese yen, though it is down 6.5 percent in dollars.
Emerging markets, measured by the Morgan Stanley Capital International index, were up 9.9 percent through Thursday, in their local currencies. In dollars, the increase is cut only to 8.4 percent, because of the fall of the dollar against the Mexican peso and the Brazilian real.
One reason for the better performance of stocks outside the United States is global investors' continuing appetite for the higher returns in emerging stock markets -- and their feeling that other developed markets can offer better performance than those in the United States.
''People remain confident about the global economy and they want riskier assets'' that offer better returns, said David Bowers, the London-based chief global investment strategist for Merrill Lynch.
''Investors know no fear,'' he added, ''and if you want risk, you get more risk outside the United States than in the United States.''
Mr. Bowers follows the predilections of big global institutional investors through Merrill Lynch's monthly survey of fund managers, which covers about 300 institutional investors who together manage about $1 trillion.
In June, the survey showed that 49 percent of those money managers were underweight in United States stocks. This means that the managers have diverged from their global benchmark index by owning a lower percentage of Wall Street than the index does. Twenty-one percent were overweight in American stocks, for a significant net underweighting of 28 percent.
Mr. Bowers says investors tend to favor markets outside the United States when the global economy is healthy and when it appears that prices and inflation are rising.
The ability to raise prices with increasing inflation makes the earnings potential of economically sensitive stocks, which do well in periods of growth, even more attractive. There are more such stocks and companies outside the United States, Mr. Bowers said.
But if global growth is slowing and inflation is under control, pricing power is reduced and economically sensitive stocks become less attractive. And that may be happening now, he said, noting the very sharp drop in May and June in the prices-paid index of the Institute for Supply Management and the relatively low level of longer-term interest rates.
''If you believe that inflation is a problem, you stay with international stocks and avoid the United States,'' he said. ''If you believe inflation is a head fake, and that earnings are becoming a scarce commodity, then you want to be in the United States.'' That is because, in tougher times, the American market has proved to be a better haven.
MR. BOWERS warned that money managers could now be shifting their sights back to the United States as inflation worries have subsided. The 28 percent net underweighting of American stocks in the June survey, while significant, was down from 32 percent in May and 43 percent in April.
If this shift continues, the United States market may have the help it needs to put its stocks back on an upward trend.

Abstract: ''I wouldn't panic at this point, but I think we do have to get used to the idea that growth is going to remain substantially slower than in the earlier part of the recovery'' that has been under way since late in 2001, said Nigel Gault, chief United States economist at Global Insight, an economic research firm in Lexington, Mass. ''Unfortunately, we will have to get used to seeing softer growth numbers as interest rates go up because of higher inflation.'' The new data provided strong evidence that the rise in the cost of oil has begun to feed into prices of other goods throughout the economy. The price index for personal consumption expenditures minus food and energy, a favorite inflation gauge of the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, jumped to an annual pace of 2.2 percent, the steepest climb since the fourth quarter of 2001. ''The inflation risk clearly tilted to the upside now,'' said David Greenlaw, chief United States fixed-income economist at Morgan Stanley. ''This report provided ammunition for the camp that says there is a risk of stagflation,'' the combination of stagnant growth and high inflation.

Full text: The economy braked sharply in the first three months of the year, the government reported yesterday, expanding at its slowest pace in two years as rising energy prices spurred a burst of increased inflation and dragged down spending by businesses and consumers.
The Commerce Department estimated that the nation's gross domestic product grew at a 3.1 percent annual rate in the first quarter, substantially slower than the 3.8 percent growth of the final three months of 2004 and the slowest pace since the first quarter of 2003.
Investors in financial markets were taken aback by the unexpected sluggishness, sending stocks tumbling and pushing bond yields down as the new data cemented expectations that the Federal Reserve will increase interest rates by another quarter of a percentage point at its meeting on Tuesday even as growth is decelerating.
On Wall Street, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 1.14 percent to close at 1,143.22, while the Dow Jones industrial average dropped more than 128 points, to 10,070.37.
''I wouldn't panic at this point, but I think we do have to get used to the idea that growth is going to remain substantially slower than in the earlier part of the recovery'' that has been under way since late in 2001, said Nigel Gault, chief United States economist at Global Insight, an economic research firm in Lexington, Mass. ''Unfortunately, we will have to get used to seeing softer growth numbers as interest rates go up because of higher inflation.''
Activity slowed across most of the economy, from consumer spending to government consumption, but the sharpest retreat was in corporate investment, which expanded at barely a third of the pace of its growth in the last three months of 2004.
Final demand -- real purchases by companies, governments and individuals -- expanded merely 1.9 percent. The rest of the expansion was a result of an $80 billion surge in the accumulation of inventories, from cars parked in dealer lots to clothing piling up on retailer shelves, as businesses were wrong-footed by slower-than-expected demand for their wares.
The new data provided strong evidence that the rise in the cost of oil has begun to feed into prices of other goods throughout the economy. The price index for personal consumption expenditures minus food and energy, a favorite inflation gauge of the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, jumped to an annual pace of 2.2 percent, the steepest climb since the fourth quarter of 2001.
''The inflation risk clearly tilted to the upside now,'' said David Greenlaw, chief United States fixed-income economist at Morgan Stanley. ''This report provided ammunition for the camp that says there is a risk of stagflation,'' the combination of stagnant growth and high inflation.
A slowing economy is not entirely unexpected. Most economists consider that the United States has the potential to grow at about 3.5 percent, on average, over the long term, substantially less than the 4.4 percent expansion recorded last year.
Consumer spending, the main buttress for economic growth over the last three years, has been expected to slow somewhat as rising interest rates take some steam out of the housing market and consumer lending. Businesses, however, were expected to invest heavily and pick up some of the slack.
''Most companies don't even have to borrow,'' said Daniel J. Meckstroth, chief economist for the Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI, a public policy and business research organization in Arlington, Va. ''They can fund investments out of cash flow.''
But the spike in energy prices appears to have thrown a wild card into the expected growth pattern.
Consumer spending maintained some vigor in the first quarter, declining to a still healthy 3.5 percent rate, from 4.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2004. Residential investment even accelerated, as low mortgage rates kept fanning the flames of a housing boom and builders scrambled to meet demand.
But business investment, which had been advancing at a double-digit clip since last spring, stalled. The growth of spending on equipment and software, for instance, dropped from 18.4 percent in the last quarter of 2004 to 6.9 percent in the first three months of this year.
While some analysts indicated that the slump could stem from the end of a tax break that until December allowed accelerated depreciation of new investments, it rekindled concerns that high energy prices would spook businesses into curtailing spending.
Still, several analysts said that the economy could yet turn around in coming months. Even as the combination of slower-than-expected growth and higher-than-expected inflation has taken many observers by surprise, some economists noted that the current slowdown has a familiar feel to it.
Last spring, for example, energy prices surged, taking a bite out of demand and giving some fizz to inflation. But the impact was temporary: lower growth helped keep inflation under wraps and when oil prices receded consumer spending picked up again and economic activity continued at a robust pace.
Steven Wieting, senior economist at Citigroup, argued that the rise in energy costs this time shaved one percentage point from output growth. But he also argued that the drag was probably over.
''We are in a hole we have to dig out of,'' Mr. Wieting said. ''But oil prices have peaked. There are reasonable prospects that the second quarter ends stronger than it began.''
Nonetheless, there are new reasons for caution. Bloated inventories may serve as an anchor on growth in the second quarter as companies work them off rather than expand factory output. Mushrooming imports are expected to curtail growth as well. In the first quarter, the trade deficit subtracted 1.49 percentage points from domestic economic output, the biggest drag since the fourth quarter of 2002.
A risk now is that consumer spending may falter and housing activity peak even as businesses keep a tighter rein on investment.
''Everybody is relying on the U.S. consumer and the U.S. housing market,'' Mr. Gault, the Global Insight economist, said. ''But the consumer is starting to sputter and in housing the numbers can't conceivably get much better.''

Abstract: The focus on the globe's economic hotspots may be overshadowing some of the world's slower-growing, established economies that are the longtime trading partners of the United States. When macroeconomists talk about deficits in the context of today's global economy, they usually refer to America's twin deficits -- the government budget deficit and the current account deficit. But economists say a third deficit, the so-called ''growth deficit'' in Europe and Japan, is having important effects on the United States economy. The large developed economies of Japan and Europe have the resources -- in theory -- to buy the expensive goods and services the United States produces. ''Japan and Europe are still very important when it comes to exports,'' said Jeffrey Frankel, an economist at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government and a former member the Council of Economic Advisers under President Clinton. ''And the story that U.S. exports have been stagnating for the last four years is really underplayed.'' Exports of goods and services fell from 11.2 percent of gross domestic product in 2000 to 10.3 percent in 2004. The growth deficit in Europe and Japan is also helping to tamp down inflation. ''With the exception of oil, global inflationary pressures remain subdued,'' said Barry Eichengreen, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley. If Japan and Europe were growing at a more rapid clip, oil prices would likely be far higher. And a small difference in growth in a slow-growing giant can help ignite the fear of inflation. In 1999, Mr. [Lakshman Achuthan] said, when Japan's economy moved from contraction to expansion, it helped cause a spike in oil and commodities.

THE next big thing in investing is what the strategists and economists at brokerage houses have taken to calling the BRIC's -- Brazil, Russia, India and China. These developing countries sport high growth rates, and produce and consume prodigious quantities of commodities, from oil to soybeans.
It's easy to see how their rapid emergence directly affects the American economy. Many discussions about the price of oil, the specter of commodity-driven inflation, and the burgeoning trade deficit begin and end with the BRIC's.
But the focus on the globe's economic hotspots may be overshadowing some of the world's slower-growing, established economies that are the longtime trading partners of the United States. When macroeconomists talk about deficits in the context of today's global economy, they usually refer to America's twin deficits -- the government budget deficit and the current account deficit. But economists say a third deficit, the so-called ''growth deficit'' in Europe and Japan, is having important effects on the United States economy.
Earlier this month, the European Central Bank reduced its forecast of 2005 growth for the Euro area--the 12 nations using the Euro as their currency -- from 2.0 percent to 1.6 percent. The International Monetary Fund last week said it expected Japan's economy to grow by a mere 0.8 percent in 2005. The I.M.F. expects the United States to grow 3.6 percent.
''Our trade and financial relations with Europe and Japan are still very large and significant,'' said Nouriel Roubini, professor of economics at New York University's Stern School of Business. Two-way trade between the United States and European Union members was $41.1 billion in February, second only to Canada. Trade with Japan was $15 billion, compared with $19 billion for China.
Lakshman Achuthan, managing director at the New York-based Economic Cycle Research Institute, notes that the volume of United States trade with the G-6 countries (Japan, Germany, France, Italy, Britain and Canada) is four times as large as the trade with China and India combined.
Consider the weakness of American exports. The level of imports tends to grab headlines -- $161.5 billion in February, the Commerce Department reported last Tuesday. But exports matter, too, especially since they can stimulate domestic job creation. In February, exports totaled just $100.4 billion.
The large developed economies of Japan and Europe have the resources -- in theory -- to buy the expensive goods and services the United States produces. ''Japan and Europe are still very important when it comes to exports,'' said Jeffrey Frankel, an economist at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government and a former member the Council of Economic Advisers under President Clinton. ''And the story that U.S. exports have been stagnating for the last four years is really underplayed.'' Exports of goods and services fell from 11.2 percent of gross domestic product in 2000 to 10.3 percent in 2004.
Clearly, slow growth in large overseas economies harms exports. But the seemingly chronic weakness in Europe and Japan is a boon to the vast portion of the American economy that is sensitive to interest rates. ''I think the biggest single way it's affected the U.S. economy is that investment levels in Japan and Europe are very low -- and that's keeping global interest rates low,'' said Kenneth Rogoff, a professor of economics at Harvard University.
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, has spoken of the conundrum of persistently low rates -- about 4.24 percent on the 10-year Treasury note -- on United States government debt. But because growth in Europe and Japan remains muted, and because monetary policy remains accommodative in those areas, United States government bonds seem high-yielding compared with their Japanese and European counterparts.
The growth deficit in Europe and Japan is also helping to tamp down inflation. ''With the exception of oil, global inflationary pressures remain subdued,'' said Barry Eichengreen, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley. If Japan and Europe were growing at a more rapid clip, oil prices would likely be far higher. And a small difference in growth in a slow-growing giant can help ignite the fear of inflation. In 1999, Mr. Achuthan said, when Japan's economy moved from contraction to expansion, it helped cause a spike in oil and commodities.
Perhaps the idling economic motors in Europe and Japan receive so little notice because we've become accustomed to them. After all, Japan's economy hasn't grown robustly for nearly a decade and a half. And some of the reasons for the lower growth are structural -- low population growth and constrictive labor laws in Europe in particular.
BUT in macroeconomics, as in investing, past performance is no guarantee of future results. In the early 1990's there was a perception that Europe and Japan were going to be growing more rapidly than the United States, thanks to their allegedly superior industrial policy. Paul Tsongas, who once sought the Democratic presidential nomination, used to say that the Cold War was over, and Germany and Japan had won.
Just so, the differential in growth rates between the United States and Europe and Japan ''isn't going to go on forever,'' said Professor Rogoff. The United States may be growing somewhat faster than its long-term growth rate, and Japan and Europe may be growing somewhat more slowly than their potential growth. ''People who extrapolate are just not looking at history,'' he said.

Abstract: Actually, the United States' deficit with China in the trade of goods narrowed somewhat, to $13.9 billion in February from $15.3 billion in January, not seasonally adjusted. The deficit with the euro area countries, meanwhile, increased 6.6 percent, to $6.5 billion, and the deficit with Japan grew by nearly 11 percent, to $6.9 billion. Kenneth S. Rogoff, a professor of economics at Harvard, observed that the United States current-account deficit, mainly the trade deficit but also other short-term financial flows like interest payments, amounts to 70 percent to 80 percent of the current-account surpluses of all the other countries in the world put together. ''The Asians are not responsible for the lack of savings in the United States,'' Mr. Rogoff said. Mr. Rogoff added that Chinese exports to the United States typically contained only 20 percent Chinese-made content. So, if China and its neighbors were to revalue their currencies by, say, 30 percent, prices at Wal-Mart might rise 5 percent but the American trade deficit would barely budge.

Full text: The United States trade deficit expanded in February for the third month in a row, reaching a record $61 billion, as the rising cost of oil and America's unrestrained appetite for foreign goods propelled imports to unprecedented heights.
The Commerce Department reported yesterday that imports ballooned to $161.5 billion, $2.6 billion more than in January. Meanwhile, exports remained virtually flat at $100.5 billion. Over all, the nation recorded a $64.7 billion deficit in the trade of goods, slightly tempered by a $3.7 billion surplus in services.
''It's an extraordinarily unprecedented trade deficit,'' said Ernest H. Preeg, a senior fellow at the Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI, a policy research group in Arlington, Va. ''It reflects a big imbalance in the global economy.''
Rising oil prices were a big part of the story. Petroleum and petroleum products accounted for two-thirds of the monthly increase in imports. Yet imports of nonoil goods rose by 0.6 percent to a record $117.4 billion. ''It's not just oil,'' said Richard D. Rippe, chief economist of the Prudential Equity Group. ''It was in a lot of categories.''
Investors in financial markets shrugged off the yawning trade gap, lifting the dollar against major currencies anyway, in expectation that the Federal Reserve would keep ratcheting up interest rates to head off inflation.
Yet economists acknowledged that the higher-than-expected deficit in the nation's external accounts would take a bigger slice out of economic growth in the first quarter, as foreign producers capture a larger share of American demand. ''Demand must grow faster than income to overcome the import drag,'' said Charles Dumas, chief international economist at Lombard Street Research in London.
Indeed, David Greenlaw and Ted Wieseman, economists at Morgan Stanley, actually shaved 0.7 percent off their estimate of economic growth in the first quarter of the year, reducing it to 3.4 percent from 4.1 percent.
The trade deficit is growing despite a protracted decline in the value of the dollar against major currencies like the euro, the yen and the Canadian dollar, which should, in theory, bolster the competitiveness of American producers in foreign markets. Exports in February were only 8.7 percent higher than in the same month of 2004, whereas imports were 17 percent higher.
Some economists argue that it is normal to see a long lag between a currency slide and adjustments in trade accounts.
But others pointed to the fact that the Chinese government has not allowed the dollar to fall at all against the yuan, and blamed China -- which alone accounts for more than a quarter of the United States' total trade deficit -- for digging America's deepening trade hole.
''China and some other Asian nations continue to keep the dollar artificially high so they can keep their exports to us far higher than they would be without such antimarket manipulations,'' said Frank Vargo, vice president for international economic affairs of the National Association of Manufacturers, in a statement.
Actually, the United States' deficit with China in the trade of goods narrowed somewhat, to $13.9 billion in February from $15.3 billion in January, not seasonally adjusted. The deficit with the euro area countries, meanwhile, increased 6.6 percent, to $6.5 billion, and the deficit with Japan grew by nearly 11 percent, to $6.9 billion.
Yet the American deficit with China was tempered by the Chinese New Year festivities in mid-February, which disrupted factory output. On a longer-term trend, the deficit was $5.5 billion bigger than it was in February last year, and China is quickly gaining market share.
For instance, Bob Piazza, the president of the Price Pump Company in Sonoma, Calif., said that the company buys about 75 percent of its parts -- mainly metal castings -- from abroad, up from 10 percent seven years ago. While Price Pump's exports, mainly to Europe, have doubled over the past year and a half, imports, mainly from China and India, have tripled.
Mr. Preeg argued that the undervalued yuan and its ripple effect -- which keeps currencies undervalued throughout East Asia -- were responsible for about one-quarter of the American trade deficit.
Other economists, however, argue that America's persistent trade hole has little to do with China and more to do with American consumption, which is being financed by foreigners' placing their money in United States government Treasury bonds and other American assets.
Kenneth S. Rogoff, a professor of economics at Harvard, observed that the United States current-account deficit, mainly the trade deficit but also other short-term financial flows like interest payments, amounts to 70 percent to 80 percent of the current-account surpluses of all the other countries in the world put together. ''The Asians are not responsible for the lack of savings in the United States,'' Mr. Rogoff said.
Mr. Rogoff added that Chinese exports to the United States typically contained only 20 percent Chinese-made content. So, if China and its neighbors were to revalue their currencies by, say, 30 percent, prices at Wal-Mart might rise 5 percent but the American trade deficit would barely budge.
Nonetheless, the growing frustration about the nation's trade performance could tempt policy makers to raise trade barriers against the Asian export powerhouse. Earlier this month, the Commerce Department said it would look into the need to reimpose trade quotas that were lifted just three months ago on a wide variety of Chinese apparel.
Mutterings against Chinese competition can also be heard in Europe, where companies have suffered as the decline in the dollar blunted their competitive edge versus their American competitors and weakened their position in East Asia, where most currencies followed the dollar down.
As China gains market share throughout the industrial world, the frustration could deepen. ''There will be a trade backlash at some point,'' Mr. Rogoff said. ''There's fraying at the edges both in Europe and the United States.''

Abstract: A. ''Positive'' is a little bit of an overstatement. I believe the dollar will remain the key reserve currency for the foreseeable future. The United States is the dominant world power, and with world power goes leadership of the currency. If you go back to the British Empire or the Dutch or the Spanish, you'll find that world power also means a dominant currency. A. The immediate issue is, ''Who is going to finance the American budget deficit?'' Let me give you a couple of numbers. Japan will continue to buy about $200 billion of U.S. government debt a year. They have a large export surplus to the United States. China, which also has a large surplus, will also probably buy about $100 billion. A. I doubt that very much. Both China and Japan are big exporters to the United States. I believe that the Chinese and Japanese, down deep, realize that if they shifted from the American dollar to the euro, it would endanger their export drive to the United States.

Full text: AuthorAffiliation William J. Holstein is editor in chief of Chief Executive magazine.
FEARS that the dollar could go into a free fall because of big budget and trade deficits are overblown, says Henry Kaufman, known for his longtime work as an economist at Salomon Brothers, where he was often bearish about American economic prospects. Now 77, he is an independent consultant and is on the board of Lehman Brothers. Here are excerpts from a recent conversation:
Q. As someone who has been bearish in general, why are you positive about the dollar?
A. ''Positive'' is a little bit of an overstatement. I believe the dollar will remain the key reserve currency for the foreseeable future. The United States is the dominant world power, and with world power goes leadership of the currency. If you go back to the British Empire or the Dutch or the Spanish, you'll find that world power also means a dominant currency.
We have an economy that is performing far, far better than the other industrialized countries. Therefore, profits here are better than they are in most places around the world. Our interest rates are competitive.
Q. But the Bush administration, despite some statements to the contrary, seems intent on expanding government deficits. Isn't that sending a bad signal?
A. The immediate issue is, ''Who is going to finance the American budget deficit?'' Let me give you a couple of numbers. Japan will continue to buy about $200 billion of U.S. government debt a year. They have a large export surplus to the United States. China, which also has a large surplus, will also probably buy about $100 billion.
Thirdly, the Federal Reserve is a buyer for monetary reasons, and that will account for $50 billion to $75 billion. Lastly, other buyers have emerged over the past year, namely some of the oil-producing countries. The price of oil has increased very dramatically. That money cannot readily be spent by producers such as Saudi Arabia and Qatar. Therefore, you have to put them in for $50 billion to $75 billion of purchases of American securities. So there isn't very much left for the time being for domestic investors to finance.
Q. But it appears there is a deeply felt sense in the administration that a cheap dollar will spur American economic growth and reduce the debt to the rest of the world.
A. If it becomes an outspoken approach by the administration, that would be quite dangerous. Talking down your own currency when you're the key reserve currency and when you are dependent on foreign sources of money would ultimately create problems. The secretary of the Treasury, as well as the president, should always articulate that ''we are in favor of a stable currency.'' They should never even whisper the idea that ''if the dollar goes down, that's all right with us.''
Q. What do you think of the quotation attributed to Vice President Dick Cheney that ''Reagan proved deficits don't matter''?
A. That is an incorrect observation by the vice president. Deficits do matter over the long term. There are times in the business cycle in which the U.S. Treasury competes very heavily against the private sector. When that occurs, it escalates interest rates. It puts pressure on inflation. It's a dangerous approach.
Q. In its heart of hearts, do you think the Bush administration agrees with you?
A. I think a number of people in the administration probably believe so. I believe a number of people in the Federal Reserve believe so. But whether the inner sanctum of the administration will say that a stable dollar is a key consideration, that may be questionable. We are just in a fortuitous situation today, meaning this year and probably next year, in which the size of the budget deficit doesn't matter for the immediate future. But ongoing budget deficits of this order of magnitude over time will matter.
Q. A Chinese official was quoted as saying that his government was not happy with the dollar's weakness. Do you think the Chinese or Japanese could shift their holdings elsewhere?
A. I doubt that very much. Both China and Japan are big exporters to the United States. I believe that the Chinese and Japanese, down deep, realize that if they shifted from the American dollar to the euro, it would endanger their export drive to the United States.
Q. So what is your prognosis for the dollar?
A. I think there is going to be reasonable stability with occasionally a little bit of a give in the value of the dollar.
Q. Do you think a decline in the value of the dollar sharply stimulates our exports?
A. I do not. It takes much longer this time around for the decline in the dollar to have a significant impact on our trade.
It involves a number of countries such as India and China that provide goods and services to us at a very low labor cost. To turn that around, that will require a really significant decline in the value of the dollar. That's not about to happen.
Q. In your lifetime, have you seen a time of such huge fiscal and trade imbalances?
A. Not really. Today, there is an enormous international disequilibrium. For the near term, it is in the best interest of all the participants to maintain it.
Q. What could trip that disequilibrium into an economic disaster for the United States?
A. We could have a massive terrorist attack. The price of oil could ratchet very high. No.3, if Europe and Japan lifted economic activity significantly, that would turn things around and put more pressure on the United States.

Abstract: Following the lead of the Big Mac index, a comparison of the price of the McDonald's sandwich around the world that is published by The Economist, Mr. [Gabriel Thulin] constructed the IKEA index, which compares a basket of 26 Ikea products, including the Moppe storage chest, across 15 countries: 8 in the euro zone, 3 non-euro European Union countries, 2 European countries not in the union, the United States and Canada. While the United States is the cheapest Ikea country over all, some products in the survey are cheaper in Europe. For instance, though Finland is the most expensive country for the full basket of Ikea goods in Mr. Thulin's index, one item, the Sultan Skymning mattress, is 42 percent less expensive there than in the United States. This indicates that high local costs -- like taxes, wages or advertising -- are not the only reason for the price differentials, because if that were the case, the cost of all products would be higher in a higher-cost market. The Ikea index, created by Gabriel Thulin, a Swedish statician, tracks the cost of a basket of 26 Ikea products across 15 countries. According to the index, the United States is the cheapest Ikea country over all, but some products in the index are cheaper elsewhere.

Full text: That a storage chest sold by the Swedish home furnishing giant Ikea costs 59 percent more in Austria than in the United States is perhaps not surprising, considering the countries are on different continents and have different currencies, taxes, inflation, labor laws and interest rates.
But that the same Moppe storage chest is 39 percent more expensive in Austria than in Germany, countries that share a border and a currency, is an indication that the introduction of the euro has yet to succeed in one of its basic missions: to create a single, transparent market where identical goods cost the same everywhere.
Just how elusive this goal has been was highlighted by some recently published research by Gabriel Thulin, a Swedish statistician.
Mr. Thulin, whose fellow Swedes voted overwhelmingly last month against membership in the European single currency, works for the financial communications consulting firm of Hallvarsson & Halvarsson. He conducted his research on his own time.
Following the lead of the Big Mac index, a comparison of the price of the McDonald's sandwich around the world that is published by The Economist, Mr. Thulin constructed the IKEA index, which compares a basket of 26 Ikea products, including the Moppe storage chest, across 15 countries: 8 in the euro zone, 3 non-euro European Union countries, 2 European countries not in the union, the United States and Canada.
According to the report, consumers in the United States pay the least for Ikea products, and those in Finland, a euro country, pay the most. Among euro countries in the survey, people in the Netherlands pay the least for the full hypothetical basket -- 17 percent less than in Finland.
The cost and time involved in buying a bookcase in Germany and transporting it to Belgium will more than cancel out any potential savings for most consumers. So Ikea can still charge Belgians 33 percent more than Germans for the Billy bookcase, even though both are euro countries and there is a German Ikea store near the Belgian border.
Ikea, like many multinational companies, is also able to charge different prices in different countries because the company is adept at exploiting local market conditions, experts say. For example, here in Italy, the fourth-most-expensive Ikea country in the index, the local competition tends to be from smaller high-end furniture stores rather than large retailers as in the United States.
''At the end of the day it is a question of supply and demand, and prices will be higher where there is more demand,'' said Lorenzo Codogno, co-head of European economic research at the Bank of America in London. ''There has been some convergence thanks to the euro, but not as much as initially expected.''
Price convergence is not the only aspect of monetary integration that did not develop as quickly as expected, Mr. Codogno said. Trade between countries in the euro zone has grown since the introduction of the common currency, he said, but not by as much as policy makers had expected.
Ikea also capitalizes on its brand name by charging more where the brand is strongest, Mr. Thulin said.
According to Marianne Barner, Ikea's communications manager, ''Each country sets its own prices, which depend on competition, wages and taxes.''
''Our philosophy is to have the lowest price on comparable products in every country, compared with our competitors,'' she added.
While the United States is the cheapest Ikea country over all, some products in the survey are cheaper in Europe. For instance, though Finland is the most expensive country for the full basket of Ikea goods in Mr. Thulin's index, one item, the Sultan Skymning mattress, is 42 percent less expensive there than in the United States. This indicates that high local costs -- like taxes, wages or advertising -- are not the only reason for the price differentials, because if that were the case, the cost of all products would be higher in a higher-cost market.
''In due time something will have to give and there will be a trend toward having similar prices in all euro countries, but many factors that make price discrimination possible are destined to remain,'' said Fabrizio Onida, an economics professor at Bocconi University in Milan. ''As long as there are differences between national markets, then price discrimination is possible.''
If the differences in pricing eventually disappear, it will be as much because of the Internet as from the introduction of the euro, because just as a Californian can go online to compare the price of a golf club sold in Nevada and New York, an Italian can see if a new stereo would cost less in Germany or France.
In fact, while the privately owned Ikea printed 131 million copies of the current catalog in 23 languages, it was the company's decision to put an increasing number of prices online that allowed Mr. Thulin to develop his index.
''The idea for the index was born five years ago, but when I tried to develop it back then it was impossible to get all the catalogs,'' Mr. Thulin said in a phone conversation from his office in Stockholm. ''Prices weren't on the Internet and I couldn't get the catalogs sent to me from some countries.''
He added that ''eventually it became inevitable to have prices online. '' Ikea has 186 stores in 31 countries, but the company will send online purchases to only 9 countries. And customers cannot buy from one nation's Ikea Web site and have the product sent to a different country, or receive a catalog for one country at an address in another.
When calculating his index, Mr. Thulin used Oct. 14 exchange rates. But the catalog's prices, guaranteed until July 2004, were set when the dollar was stronger relative to the euro, and the dollar's recent fall in value played a role in making the United States the cheapest Ikea country in the survey.
Mr. Thulin said he chose Ikea for his study because, among other things, the store has many products that are exactly the same in every market; the goods are not perishable so they can, in theory, be easily transported from one country to another; and the goods for all countries are all made in the same factories so production costs are the same.
He also said he was planning to repeat the index next year, so it may be possible to see whether, at least according to some home furnishings, the single currency is leading to an alignment of prices in euro land.

Abstract: ''With the current account deficit at a record high, it's silly to say it can't possibly be of any importance,'' said John Lipsky, chief economist at the Chase Manhattan Corporation. ''But the current account deficit is only a sign of other developments of more direct importance, in this case the significant and sustained growth differential between the U.S. and its trading partners.'' The current account deficit, which amounted to 3.7 percent of total economic output for all of last year and 4.2 percent in the fourth quarter, is projected by most economists to rise again this year. It is already by far the largest among the big industrialized countries. The last time trade was a big issue for the American economy, during the mid-and late-1980's, the current account deficit peaked at 3.4 percent of gross domestic product. It could recede quickly if Japan bounces back and Europe's recovery continues, especially if the Federal Reserve also succeeds in slowing the growth of economic demand in the United States. And in any case, foreign companies and investors have been happy so far to finance the deficit by recycling the dollars they earn through trade back into the United States, where the technology-fueled boom has offered high rates of return. Indeed, some economists see the current account deficit more as an indicator of a healthy surge of foreign investment into the United States than as a sign of a sickening trade imbalance.

Full text: If this bionic economy has a soft underbelly, it may be trade.
As Americans gorge on imported cars, electronics, clothing and a long list of other goods from abroad, the nation's trade deficit has swollen to record proportions, leaving economists and policy makers increasingly troubled.
The trade deficit for March, the most recent month for which data is available, was $30.2 billion, 56 percent higher than in March 1999. Imports for March totaled $117.4 billion, up 21.9 percent from the corresponding month a year earlier.
Broader measures of the nation's international transactions have also deteriorated. The current account deficit -- which includes foreigners' profits on investments in the United States and Americans' investments in other countries as well as trade in goods and services -- reached $338.9 billion in 1999, up 53.6 percent from 1998.
The current account deficit, which amounted to 3.7 percent of total economic output for all of last year and 4.2 percent in the fourth quarter, is projected by most economists to rise again this year. It is already by far the largest among the big industrialized countries. The last time trade was a big issue for the American economy, during the mid-and late-1980's, the current account deficit peaked at 3.4 percent of gross domestic product.
The main reason for the surge is clear. For the last few years, the American economy has been booming, while those of its major trading partners have been weak. As a result, the thirst for imported goods has grown even as the market for American exports has stagnated.
What is less clear is whether the trade imbalance will prove to be a substantial problem.
It could recede quickly if Japan bounces back and Europe's recovery continues, especially if the Federal Reserve also succeeds in slowing the growth of economic demand in the United States. And in any case, foreign companies and investors have been happy so far to finance the deficit by recycling the dollars they earn through trade back into the United States, where the technology-fueled boom has offered high rates of return. Indeed, some economists see the current account deficit more as an indicator of a healthy surge of foreign investment into the United States than as a sign of a sickening trade imbalance.
But there is a worst-case set of possibilities out there that haunts many economists: foreign investors lose faith in the American economy's relative advantages, investment from abroad dries up, the dollar plunges, inflation jumps and the Fed is forced to respond by driving interest rates sharply higher, endangering the long expansion.
With the American economy strong and unemployment low, the growing trade deficit so far has not produced the same protectionist pressures that previous surges in the trade gap have provoked. Yes, anxiety about competition from low- wage workers abroad was at the heart of labor's failed campaign against normalizing trade relations with China. But the trade gap itself has merited hardly a mention so far in the presidential campaign.
And in contrast to the 1980's, when the United States was plagued by a simultaneous rise in its trade and budget deficits, the federal government is currently running a large budget surplus, providing a substantial cushion for the economy.
Still, the situation has policy makers in Washington concerned. Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, has repeatedly warned that the rapid growth in imports compared with a much more modest increase in exports cannot go on forever. And it has been on the mind of Lawrence H. Summers, the Treasury secretary.
''When a large external imbalance reflects a period of strong growth relative to the rest of the world, and relatively high investment in our productive potential, as it does in the United States today,'' Mr. Summers said in a speech last month, ''that imbalance is unlikely to pose an immediate threat to our economic well-being.''
But, Mr. Summers added, ''a large and growing current account deficit is not something that can be sustained indefinitely.''
''It can also give rise to protectionist pressures,'' he said, ''and it distorts the pattern of domestic economic activity.''
The Clinton administration has shown no inclination to push down the dollar to promote exports by making American goods cheaper when purchased in foreign currencies. Indeed, calls for a weaker dollar from exporters and industries that compete with imports have been relatively muted compared with the 1980's, when auto companies, steel makers, farmers and other howled about their inability to compete with their foreign counterparts.
Instead, the administration has stressed the importance of increasing national savings by paying down the federal debt -- a step that could help reduce reliance on foreign capital -- and has pressed Japan and Europe to overhaul their economies to create more demand for goods from the United States.
''We'd see a more balanced situation if Europe and Japan were growing faster,'' said Ralph C. Bryant, an economist at the Brookings Institution, the research organization. ''But you wouldn't want to put the brakes hard on the U.S. economy just to get the trade and current account deficits smaller, and you don't want to put up new fences at the border. That would be far more costly than would make sense.''
But as the current account deficit has grown, there has been an increasing debate inside and outside of government about the degree of the threat posed by the trade gap.
One camp views the deficit as essentially benign.
In this view, the trade gap will narrow as the American economy slows. In any case, imports so far in this economic cycle have served as a safety valve for the supercharged American economy, helping to keep inflation under control at a time when domestic producers cannot keep up with demand.
Moreover, by purchasing so much from abroad, the United States has helped many other countries rebound from the financial crisis that swept around the world in 1998. And by investing the dollars they earn back into the United States, foreign companies, governments and investors are adding to the pool of capital that American companies have used to become more productive and competitive.
''With the current account deficit at a record high, it's silly to say it can't possibly be of any importance,'' said John Lipsky, chief economist at the Chase Manhattan Corporation. ''But the current account deficit is only a sign of other developments of more direct importance, in this case the significant and sustained growth differential between the U.S. and its trading partners.''
At the same time, Mr. Lipsky added, ''The emergence of what is sometimes called the new economy has attracted foreign investors.''
In the sense that the current account deficit is just the reverse side of a flood of foreign direct investment in the United States, ''it represents something good about the U.S., not something bad,'' Mr. Lipsky said.
But there is a more dire view of the trade imbalance.
In this view, further expansion in the current account deficit cannot be sustained. The deficit is at a level that leaves the economy vulnerable to a sharp fall in the value of the dollar, a jump in inflation and interest rates, and a slowdown in growth or even a recession.
''You cannot continually run a growing current account deficit without ultimately facing a very sharp fall in your exchange rate, which in the current circumstances of the U.S. economy could be a killer,'' said C. Fred Bergsten, the director of the Institute for International Economics in Washington.
The chain of events that Mr. Bergsten worries about would involve a steep drop in the dollar, a resulting surge in inflation and a determined response by the Federal Reserve to restore stability by pushing interest rates up sharply.
The current account gap, Mr. Bergsten said, is ''the single biggest threat to the current expansion of the economy.''
Among policy makers in Washington, there is less a sense of crisis than a gnawing concern about the long-term trends in trade. Officials at the Fed cite a theory first developed in the 1960's by Hendrik S. Houthakker, an economist at Harvard University. He found that growth in imports to the United States relative to income growth runs at roughly twice the rate it does in the rest of the world. That finding has been confirmed repeatedly over the years.
In other words, if the American economy is expanding at anything close to the rest of the world's growth rate, the American trade deficit will increase.
That was not a big problem during a lot of the post-World War II period, when much of the rest of the world experienced higher growth rates than the United States. But should growth in the United States remain as strong as it has been the last few years, and should the rest of the world not rebound, it could push the trade deficit to previously unimagined levels.
In political terms, there is also the possibility of the trade deficit with a particular country or set of countries creating protectionist pressures in Washington. Organized labor is likely to keep a close eye on trade with China, which is about to join the World Trade Organization. And any renewed effort by Japan to export its way out of its doldrums could bring a return of the trade tensions that characterized its relationship with the United States for years.
But among consumers, who have enjoyed lower prices and improved quality in many products as a result of global competition, there are few signs of worry.
''If Americans are going to want me to buy their car, then they need to offer me a good product,'' said Diane Spivey of Clermont, Ga., who recently bought a Volkswagen Passat. ''I don't look on it as your economy and my economy. The world is a pretty small place these days.''

Abstract: THE Federal Reserve, as everyone knows, is always trying to keep inflation down without sacrificing too much economic growth. The public debate that accompanies this process focuses on the behavior of the real economy. The booming stock market has stretched that focus, of course. But even so, the Fed's chairman, Alan Greenspan, is expressing greater concern lately about the dangers of a high stock market and rising home prices. Far more than in the 1970's or 1980's, the wealth embedded in stocks and home ownership generates spending, and thus raises the odds that consumer demand will exceed the nation's supply of labor, materials and services. Inflation would then accelerate. Mr. Greenspan and his fellow policymakers have argued that case in the past. And now the chairman has underscored his concern in three speeches since mid-October. Mr. Greenspan himself has probably not decided yet. The Fed tries to control inflation, or the threat of it, by raising interest rates. But the target is inflation itself, Fed officials insist, not any one of the contributors to it, like stock prices. In his recent speeches, Mr. Greenspan has not changed that message. But his remarks have heightened the profile of stock prices and home prices as potential contributors to inflation.

Full text: THE Federal Reserve, as everyone knows, is always trying to keep inflation down without sacrificing too much economic growth. The public debate that accompanies this process focuses on the behavior of the real economy. The booming stock market has stretched that focus, of course. But even so, the Fed's chairman, Alan Greenspan, is expressing greater concern lately about the dangers of a high stock market and rising home prices.
Far more than in the 1970's or 1980's, the wealth embedded in stocks and home ownership generates spending, and thus raises the odds that consumer demand will exceed the nation's supply of labor, materials and services. Inflation would then accelerate. Mr. Greenspan and his fellow policymakers have argued that case in the past. And now the chairman has underscored his concern in three speeches since mid-October.
''The frequency with which he makes this point means that his not-terribly-successful campaign to talk down the stock market continues,'' said Alan Blinder, a Princeton economist and a former Fed vice chairman. ''He has not given up.''
And if his jawboning doesn't work? If stock prices fail to decline from present levels, or even resume their climb? Would he want to raise rates at the next Fed policy meeting, on Nov. 16, fulfilling an expectation that unsettles the stock market?
Mr. Greenspan himself has probably not decided yet. The Fed tries to control inflation, or the threat of it, by raising interest rates. But the target is inflation itself, Fed officials insist, not any one of the contributors to it, like stock prices. In his recent speeches, Mr. Greenspan has not changed that message. But his remarks have heightened the profile of stock prices and home prices as potential contributors to inflation.
The economy once drove the stock market; now the opposite is true. Raising rates is one way to discourage stock buying and nullify the market's inflationary potential.
''There is no question that the stock market has become an important component'' of our discussions, said Edward M. Kelley Jr., a Fed governor.
Mr. Greenspan's recent speeches outline these discussions, or at least his decisive contribution to them. New technologies, he argues, have made corporate management more efficient, and have raised the level of labor productivity, or the amount of goods, services and revenue that an average worker produces in an hour. All this adds to Corporate America's capacity to increase supply and thus satisfy rising demand.
Rising stock prices reflect this improvement, Mr. Greenspan says. They also reflect a view that stocks are less risky an investment than in the past and therefore worth more. Both factors, however, may be unsustainable. Stock prices, in short, may be unjustifiably high, in bubble territory.
A financial crisis could restore the old risk factor. A stock that now seems worth $10 may, a few months from now, be fairly valued at only $8 to a more nervous investor. The ''equity premium'' will have risen, or, as Mr. Greenspan puts it, ''The key question is whether the recent decline in equity premiums is permanent or temporary.'' If the improvement is temporary, then stocks will eventually plunge in some crisis, damaging the economy and also creditors who have loaned tens of millions of dollars for the purchase of stocks.
THE productivity-growth trend presents another danger. While it certainly is at a higher level than in the recent past, that level cannot keep on rising. When the inevitable plateau comes, Mr. Greenspan warned in one of his speeches, then consumer demand, still driven by market wealth, ''can accelerate so much that total demand could rise above even the productivity-augmented'' greater supply of goods and services. As demand exceeds supply, shortages develop and prices rise.
A speech on Tuesday added home prices to the mix, but in a subordinate role to stocks. For every dollar of stock market gain, consumer outlays are lifted by 3 to 4 cents, Mr. Greenspan said, while higher home prices yield 5 cents for each dollar of gain. But only ''about a sixth of the so-called wealth effect -- that is, the impact of capital gains on consumer spending -- stems from equity extracted from the sale of existing homes,'' he said, or the refinancing of mortgages. The rest comes from the huge, booming stock market.
The distinction adds to the stock market's importance in the Fed's deliberations. ''Greenspan is not targeting the stock market,'' said William C. Dudley, a chief economist at Goldman, Sachs, ''but he is saying the market is an increasingly important factor in setting interest rates.''

Abstract: After yesterday's surprise move, the real tumbled another 8 percent, but stock markets from Toronto to Santiago surged in apparent relief that Brazil would no longer waste billions of dollars propping up the currency. For a day, at least, Brazil did not threaten to spin out of control, taking the rest of Latin America down with it. Whatever Brazil's decision, it will reverberate throughout the world. The impact will be felt most heavily in Argentina, Brazil's biggest trading partner and, like Brazil, a country that has only recently recovered from years of hyperinflation. Should the Brazilian currency be allowed to trade freely, it is unclear how the Argentine peso could keep its dollar peg when most of its exports and imports will be priced in a currency that can fluctuate wildly in value. Currency volatility is the last thing Latin American economies need, as they enter a period of slowing growth and rising unemployment. A. Brazil is the biggest economy in Latin America, about twice as big as Mexico's. While it buys just 3 percent of United States exports, its economic health is vital to a region that accounts for one-fifth of United States exports. But Brazil looms even larger in the minds of international investors for the simple reason that it was one of the last large countries to go down the road of free trade, privatization and hard money. If that approach fails in Brazil, the ideal of a unified global economy knit together by trade and investment is threatened. That is one reason that the I.M.F. cobbled together one of the biggest rescue packages in history, and one factor in the Federal Reserve's decision to lower interest rates in the United States three times last fall.

Full text: On Wednesday, Brazil drew a line in the sand in front of its embattled currency, the real. Yesterday, it erased that line, sending the sand scattering, as it allowed the real to trade freely against other currencies.
That abrupt reversal came after investors doubted the Brazilian Government's ability to defend the currency following the resignation of Brazil's hard-money central bank chief, Gustavo Franco, and the 9 percent devaluation in the real's value on Wednesday.
After yesterday's surprise move, the real tumbled another 8 percent, but stock markets from Toronto to Santiago surged in apparent relief that Brazil would no longer waste billions of dollars propping up the currency. For a day, at least, Brazil did not threaten to spin out of control, taking the rest of Latin America down with it.
But throwing in the towel on its old policy of pegging the real to the dollar is only a stopgap. Now the Brazilian Government and international finance policy makers must wrestle with what comes next.
Brazil has the same choices that other countries with tottering currencies have had. It can continue allowing the currency to trade freely, or it can try to set a new trading range and maintain that range by buying reais in the foreign exchange market.
Or it can follow the more radical example of its neighbor Argentina, and set up a currency board, which would peg the real to the dollar at a fixed rate of exchange.
Such options are likely to be discussed this weekend, when Brazil's Finance Minister and central bank chief meet in Washington with officials from the International Monetary Fund and the United States Treasury Department.
Whatever Brazil's decision, it will reverberate throughout the world. The impact will be felt most heavily in Argentina, Brazil's biggest trading partner and, like Brazil, a country that has only recently recovered from years of hyperinflation. Should the Brazilian currency be allowed to trade freely, it is unclear how the Argentine peso could keep its dollar peg when most of its exports and imports will be priced in a currency that can fluctuate wildly in value. Currency volatility is the last thing Latin American economies need, as they enter a period of slowing growth and rising unemployment.
For American investors and businesses, the Brazilian eruption is the latest chapter in a contagious currency crisis that started in Thailand in July 1997 and spread as far as Russia last summer. If the turmoil leads to a prolonged downturn on Wall Street or cuts heavily into American exports, the robust economy in the United States could turn anemic. Here is a brief guide to what is at stake and what might happen next:
Q. Why is Brazil so important?
A. Brazil is the biggest economy in Latin America, about twice as big as Mexico's. While it buys just 3 percent of United States exports, its economic health is vital to a region that accounts for one-fifth of United States exports. But Brazil looms even larger in the minds of international investors for the simple reason that it was one of the last large countries to go down the road of free trade, privatization and hard money. If that approach fails in Brazil, the ideal of a unified global economy knit together by trade and investment is threatened. That is one reason that the I.M.F. cobbled together one of the biggest rescue packages in history, and one factor in the Federal Reserve's decision to lower interest rates in the United States three times last fall.
Q. What's a devaluation?
A. Both devaluation and depreciation refer to a decline in the value of a currency. The distinction is this: when a government has declared that it is pegging its currency to another and will defend it by any means necessary but lets it fall anyway, that is a devaluation; when the falling currency is that of a country that allows the market to set its value and its value falls, that is a depreciation. One involves a broken promise; the other doesn't.
When Brazil announced its devaluation, overseas investors saw it as a sign that the Government was caving in to political pressure from unions and big business to put its anti-inflation strategy on the back burner and to fight unemployment instead.
Q. Why did Brazilians make the choices they made?
A. Brazil pegged its currency to the dollar in the first place as a way of convincing investors at home and abroad that it would no longer tolerate the chronic inflation that has plagued it for decades. When the so-called Real Plan was enacted in 1994 inflation was running at more than 3,000 percent. Like Russia and scores of other developing countries, Brazil had long financed huge Government commitments mainly by printing money rather than collecting taxes.
But fixing the exchange rate and getting inflation down initially proved easier than scaling back Government commitments. Brazil has a social security system that allows workers to retire after 20 years, often with pensions higher than the pay workers were earning on the job. What is more, it takes the equivalent of a constitutional amendment to lay off public workers.
At the same time, Brazil's economy has been stagnating, unemployment is at near-record levels, exports are falling and the trade deficit is way up. Tight money was not only hurting exporters by keeping the currency strong but was keeping interest rates high (around 30 percent). Remember the early 1980's, when the United States had a big budget deficit and the Federal Reserve's chairman, Paul A. Volcker, declared war on inflation? Interest rates were sky high, the dollar was extremely strong and American manufacturers were screaming murder.
Now, Brazil's industrialists and unions are the ones who are screaming. They want a weaker currency to stimulate exports by making their goods more competitive on the world market -- even at the cost of more inflation, lately running less than 3 percent a year. Newspapers in Sao Paulo, the industrial center of Brazil, had been calling for Mr. Franco's head for months.
Q. What did Brazil hope to accomplish?
A. The devaluation was supposed to buy time. If investors had gone along, bond prices might have stabilized or gone up, interest rates might have leveled off or fallen, and exports might have received a lift. But the strategy fell apart almost as soon as it was introduced for the same reason it failed in Thailand, Russia and elsewhere. Investors at home and abroad simply were not convinced that the first devaluation would be the last. They saw it as a sign of more to come. Any investor holding a currency she thought was going to be worth less tomorrow would sell immediately.
With foreigners and, increasingly, domestic investors taking large positions against the real, Brazil faced a nasty choice. It could try to stem the tide by using its hard-currency reserves. Unlike Mexico in 1994 or Russia in 1998, Brazil had roughly $40 billion in reserves as well as a $30 billion credit line from the I.M.F. Or it could let the currency fall to whatever value the market placed on it, making no promises to exchange it for dollars at a particular rate or to defend it if it fell below a certain level. It chose the latter.
Q. What are Brazil's options now?
A. A jet flying at 40,000 feet can fall 10,000 feet and still avoid disaster if the pilot manages to regain control of the aircraft. Everything depends on Brazil's regaining control of its economic policy. For the moment, at least, it has. But to resolve its currency crisis, Brazilian policy makers must choose among several long-term strategies.
Brazil could simply announce a new fixed rate -- or more accurately a new range of rates -- tied to the dollar to replace the old range of rates. As with the old regime, the new currency system could be devalued by a specified, tiny amount every few days, but no more than that. The central bank would promise to use monetary policy and foreign exchange reserves to support the value of the currency in the foreign exchange market. But this would work only if Brazil could keep investors convinced that it was going to keep its promises more faithfully in the future.
With good reason, the Finance Minister of Mexico noted at the height of his country's currency crisis that only the most extreme exchange rate regimes -- in other words, those that essentially remove any discretion -- truly rule out the threat of speculative attacks. A permanent floating rate, the system that the United States and most other rich countries have embraced, is one such extreme. The other, chosen by Argentina and a number of former Soviet republics, is to adopt a system that virtually rules out devaluation by putting foreign exchange policy in the hands of a currency board.
Letting your currency fluctuate with supply and demand has the definite advantage of allowing the currency to adjust to shocks like, say, a collapse in commodity prices. Further, a country does not risk speculative attack because it has not promised to exchange r its currency for a specified amount of dollars. Alas, Brazil is not a good candidate for a permanent floating exchange rate scheme.
For starters, where Brazil goes, Argentina must follow. Argentina, Brazil's biggest trading partner and a fellow recovering inflation addict, would be forced to abandon its fixed rate currency strategy -- a strategy that seems to be working well and one that lots of investors are counting on.
The Brazilian Government's huge domestic debt, around $270 billion, also poses an obstacle. Because the Government could not persuade investors to lend it money except by providing very short maturities and promising to index much of the debt to dollars, every time the exchange rate fell, the Government's obligations would jump. A big drop in the currency would mean instant default, just as it did in Russia last summer or in Mexico in 1995.
Another option for Brazil, a currency board, is the most radical, but has some strong supporters both within Brazil's central bank and in the I.M.F. It is a desperate measure that involves giving up all pretense of controlling one's own currency and in effect replacing the central bank with a board that includes some foreigners. On the other hand, Argentina, which has such a board, has been able to borrow on world markets at the modest rate of 8 percent this week.
Under a currency board, the supply of reais in circulation would have to be fully backed by dollars and convertible, on demand, at a fixed rate of exchange. In effect, Brazil would be handing over control of its money supply -- which would fluctuate with the amount of dollars available -- to Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve.
Currency boards have long been considered an appropriate strategy for small economies that rely heavily on international trade. They do not eliminate the need to solve the fiscal imbalance, but simply take away the option of printing more money to finance shortfalls -- yet another hard choice for Brazil.

Abstract: Since the securities were first offered, a little more than a year ago, only three retail funds specializing in them have been introduced. Together, the funds have just $26.6 million in assets, some of which is in inflation-indexed securities issued by other countries. According to Daniel S. Bernstein, director of research at Bridgewater Associates in Wilton, Conn., when the inflation-indexed securities were issued last year, inflation would have had to be 3.3 percent or more a year for the notes to earn a higher total return than traditional Treasury notes. Today, he said, inflation would have to be just 2 percent or more a year for them to do so. If inflation does strike harder, these securities will offer better protection than traditional inflation hedges like commodities, precious metals, collectibles or real estate, said John B. Brynjolfsson, manager of the $7.7 million Pimco Real Return Bond fund, another of the funds specializing in inflation-indexed securities. That is because inflation-indexed notes not only guarantee that the principal of the securities will maintain today's purchasing power, by rising with inflation, but they also offer interest income, now about 3.7 percent for 10-year issues.

That is how investors have greeted the small crop of new mutual funds investing in inflation-indexed Government securities.
Since the securities were first offered, a little more than a year ago, only three retail funds specializing in them have been introduced. Together, the funds have just $26.6 million in assets, some of which is in inflation-indexed securities issued by other countries.
But now, precisely because inflation is so low, the cost of buying protection against its rise is about the cheapest it has been since the Government began issuing the securities in 1997. And that could make this the right choice at the right time for people seeking a conservative fixed-income investment.
''I can't say what inflation will be in 10 years, but inflation protection costs less now than it did,'' said David W. Schroeder, manager of one of the funds, the $5.2 million American Century-Benham Inflation-Adjusted Treasury fund.
According to Daniel S. Bernstein, director of research at Bridgewater Associates in Wilton, Conn., when the inflation-indexed securities were issued last year, inflation would have had to be 3.3 percent or more a year for the notes to earn a higher total return than traditional Treasury notes. Today, he said, inflation would have to be just 2 percent or more a year for them to do so.
''From a year ago to today, it just makes inflation-indexed bonds more attractive,'' he said.
If inflation does strike harder, these securities will offer better protection than traditional inflation hedges like commodities, precious metals, collectibles or real estate, said John B. Brynjolfsson, manager of the $7.7 million Pimco Real Return Bond fund, another of the funds specializing in inflation-indexed securities. That is because inflation-indexed notes not only guarantee that the principal of the securities will maintain today's purchasing power, by rising with inflation, but they also offer interest income, now about 3.7 percent for 10-year issues.
''That essentially means until the year 2008 you can lock in a 3.7 percent real return above inflation,'' Mr. Brynjolfsson said.
INSTITUTIONAL investors worldwide have bought most of the $39 billion in these securities that the United States Treasury has issued so far. Retail investors have been more reticent, and for several reasons.
The first, of course, is low inflation -- it is about 1.4 percent a year now, down from 3 percent at the time of the first, $7 billion offering of 10-year notes last year, and it shows no signs of picking up. Selling inflation-indexed bonds now is like ''selling ice in the winter,'' said Michael Shamosh, chief fixed-income strategist at Gabriele Hueglin & Cashman, a New York brokerage firm.
Investors have also avoided the securities because of a tax on the so-called phantom income that accrues in the notes but is not passed on to investors until the security matures. Unlike regular Treasury notes and bonds, which have a fixed principal and a fixed coupon, the principal in an inflation-indexed bond is adjusted continually for inflation, as determined by monthly changes in the Consumer Price Index. If inflation were to rise 10 percent in a year, the principal of a $1,000 bond would adjust to $1,100 and holders would be taxed on the $100 gain as ordinary income, even though they had not pocketed the increase.
But it is most likely that individual investors have shied from inflation-linked funds because their returns have paled in comparison with those of other fixed-income funds, let alone the soaring returns of stock funds.
The average total return of the three retail funds -- the third is Brown Brothers Harriman's 59 Wall Street Inflation-Indexed Securities -- was 3.7 percent for the 12 months ended March 31, according to Morningstar Inc., the financial publisher in Chicago. That is less than the 3.9 percent return of a Lehman Brothers index of the Treasury's inflation-indexed securities for the same period, and well below the 10.5 percent return of intermediate-term Government bond funds or the 7.4 percent return of short-term Government bond funds, Morningstar said.
The meager results reflect the fact that ''real yields,'' or interest rates minus inflation, have risen and prices have fallen in the last 12 months. At the same time, yields on traditional bonds have fallen and prices have risen because inflation has continued to drop. The first 10-year inflation-indexed Treasury note, for instance, was priced at 101.05 percent of par value when American Century opened its fund on Feb. 10 last year; on April 1 this year, the note's price had fallen to 97 percent of par value -- although the loss was not quite as great as it seems because the par value had grown in line with inflation. The fund, meanwhile, returned 3.4 percent for the year ended March 31.
While this short-term record is lackluster, long-term investors should not be discouraged, said Mr. Schroeder, the fund's manager. ''Folks should know that, over the short term, performance will be impacted by changes in real yields, while long-term performance will be impacted more by changes in inflation,'' he said.
That is a strong reason to take a look at these securities now, when the inflation protection is relatively cheap. The traditional 10-year Treasury note yields about 5.5 percent, while 10-year inflation-linked notes yield about 3.7 percent -- a difference of just under two percentage points. If inflation were 2 percent a year or higher for the next 10 years, the return on the inflation-indexed security would be higher than the return on the traditional 10-year note, Mr. Schroeder said.
Mr. Brynjolfsson's fund, Pimco Real Return Bond, is the best-performing of the three retail offerings. It had a total return of just over 4 percent for the 12 months ended March 31, according to Morningstar.
The manager uses several strategies to outperform the Lehman Brothers index of inflation-linked securities, including the buying of foreign inflation-indexed bonds -- other big issuers include Canada, New Zealand and Australia -- and securities issued by corporations and agencies in the United States.
The $13.7 million 59 Wall Street Inflation-Indexed Securities fund also invests overseas and in corporate issues. Only American Century sticks solely with United States Government issues.
All these funds will have the opportunity to lock in inflation protection over a longer period on Wednesday, when the Treasury Department auctions $8 billion in 30-year inflation-indexed securities.

Abstract: Despite a decline in export sales, the economy in all regions of the United States remains strong -- yet inflation seems ''eerily calm,'' the Federal Reserve said today. ''Industrial activity is on the rise in most parts of the country, with orders and production up,'' it said in its ''beige book'' survey of regional economic conditions. ''Most districts, though, are experiencing a decline in exports to Asia.'' Before the Asian crisis emerged in full force this fall, the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, and his colleagues had been warning that labor shortages in the United States could eventually lead to increased inflation.

Full text: Despite a decline in export sales, the economy in all regions of the United States remains strong -- yet inflation seems ''eerily calm,'' the Federal Reserve said today.
''Industrial activity is on the rise in most parts of the country, with orders and production up,'' it said in its ''beige book'' survey of regional economic conditions. ''Most districts, though, are experiencing a decline in exports to Asia.''
American consumers continue to spend strongly on most items except cars, the report said. It was based on information collected through March 9.
''Retail sales are generally up in most districts, exceeding retailers' expectations in many of them,'' it said. ''Auto sales, however, are generally down, although demand for pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles remains high.''
Before the Asian crisis emerged in full force this fall, the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, and his colleagues had been warning that labor shortages in the United States could eventually lead to increased inflation.
Since then, they have been counting on the impact of the Asian turmoil to dampen growth and ease labor shortages in the United States. So far, though, that does not seem to be happening, the beige book said.
''The demand for labor remains strong, with nearly all districts reporting shortages of workers at the entry level and in certain skilled categories,'' it said. ''Widespread labor market tightness appears to have increased the degree of wage pressures.''
Despite that, ''pressures on product prices remain eerily calm,'' it said, adding, ''Domestic competition, productivity gains and the Asian situation help to constrain production costs.''
The beige book, named after the color of its cover, was prepared for the March 31 meeting of the Fed's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee. The panel sets short-term interest rates through changes in the overnight rate on loans between banks.
A year ago, it nudged the rate up by a quarter percentage point, to 5.5 percent, citing excess demand in the economy. Since then, it has left the rate untouched, watching nervously to see if strong growth and scarce labor would produce increased inflation.
In other developments, the beige book said that mild weather in many parts of the country, the product of the El Nino current in the Pacific Ocean, had created ''unseasonably hardy'' housing markets and healthy commercial real estate markets.
But conditions on the nation's farms are mixed, it said.
''An abundance of precipitation has harmed crop prospects and delayed field preparation activities,'' it said.

A roundup of regional economic conditions in recent months for the Federal Reserve's 12 districts, according to the beige book report issued by the Fed yesterday.
Minneapolis -- Growth continued at a steady pace led by the construction, manufacturing and retail industries.
Chicago -- Growth increased modestly, led by gains in consumer spending and housing. Manufacturing operated near capacity and new orders showed no signs of slowing.
Cleveland -- The economy continued to grow at a moderate pace. Labor markets were strong and price pressures light. Real estate flourished.
Boston -- Retail sales picked up while manufacturing had mixed results. Many companies reported hiring difficulties.
New York -- The economy grew briskly in the first two months of 1998 with better-than-expected retail sales. The housing market retained momentum.
Philadelphia Manufacturers saw continued strength in shipments and orders, while retail sales were rising. Car sales eased.
Richmond Retail sales rose above last year's level. Manufacturers said shipments and orders rebounded sharply and real estate picked up.
Atlanta -- The Southeastern economy continued to grow at a moderate pace. Retail sales met expectations; home sales rose as mortgage rates declined.
St. Louis -- The economy continued to generate business growth with few signs of rising prices. Retail sales met expectations while manufacturers experienced strong sales and orders.
Kansas City Labor markets remained tight, with intensifying wage increases. Retail prices held steady, sales dipped slightly and construction slowed.
Dallas -- Economic activity expanded at about the same pace or a little slower as before. Manufacturing prices were flat to down while the service and construction industries saw higher prices.
San Francisco -- The economy continued its vigorous growth although with signs of moderation in certain areas, including retail sales. The effects of Asian economic turmoil were evident in several sectors.

Abstract: Seven thousand miles away, on Capitol Hill, the I.M.F. is also a target of growing criticism -- but for exactly the opposite reasons. Here, the call is for far more American intrusiveness in I.M.F. programs, and a far smaller American contribution to solving Asia-style crises.

Full text: ALL over Southeast Asia, people are complaining that a cabal of heartless bureaucrats at an institution many have come to loathe -- the International Monetary Fund -- is worsening their economic misery. Here in Washington, the I.M.F. isn't a lot more popular, but for very different reasons.
Almost every night in Thailand, a stream of television commentators chafe at the humiliation of witnessing their country's leaders negotiate every element of national economic policy -- from interest rates to budget deficits -- with economists who work largely in secrecy out of the I.M.F.'s offices off Pennsylvania Avenue here.
Outside a McDonald's in Jakarta, Indonesia, last month, a clutch of young professionals argued that the fund, which had just forced President Suharto to terminate government subsidies that kept the price of fuel and food low, is simply a tool of an American, Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin.
''There's a rumor that this is all a game started by America,'' said a 27-year-old advertising executive named Doli, repeating a version of an oft-heard conspiracy theory in which Washington secretly plotted to destroy Asian competitors. ''America should not have let the rupiah keep dropping,'' he said, dismissing suggestions that Indonesia might bear some responsibility for the 80 percent plunge in its currency.
Indeed, throughout Asia these days, people talk about the I.M.F. as if it were a branch of the Clinton Administration, and as if it -- with Washington's connivance -- aspires to run the region today the way Gen. Douglas MacArthur ran it a half-century ago. Around Asia, one hears variants of the same lament: The fund is imposing too many conditions, often the wrong ones, and providing too little real financial support in Asia's moment of need.
Seven thousand miles away, on Capitol Hill, the I.M.F. is also a target of growing criticism -- but for exactly the opposite reasons. Here, the call is for far more American intrusiveness in I.M.F. programs, and a far smaller American contribution to solving Asia-style crises. At the extreme ends of both parties, there are calls to kill off the I.M.F. altogether. While that is hardly likely, Congress has the opportunity in the next few months to send a message that will be heard in markets around the globe. It will be debating the question of whether the United States should fulfill its commitment to provide $18 billion in additional contributions to the fund so that it can handle new outbreaks of the kind of the economic contagion that is still whipping through Asia. If Congress balks, few doubt that the rest of the world will, too.
Rarely in its 52-year history has the fund been under such concerted attack from so many quarters. Liberals complain that its actions in Asia chiefly benefit the likes of Citicorp and J. P. Morgan, to say nothing of Japan's biggest banks, often at the expense of workers -- both abroad and in the United States -- whose jobs are threatened by its policies. Conservatives say that the emergency help for South Korea, Indonesia and Thailand interferes with free markets, and that they undercut American jobs by encouraging the afflicted countries to export their way out of trouble. Many economists say the I.M.F.'s prescriptions are only making things worse, though because they are economists, they disagree forcefully on what prescriptions would make things better.
CAUGHT in the uncomfortable middle is Mr. Rubin. For three years, since the United States stepped in to rescue Mexico, he has been struggling to get nations around the world to prepare for future crises by bolstering their contributions to the I.M.F. and agreeing that international consortiums, not the United States, serve as the lender of last resort. In Asia, the I.M.F. has taken the lead -- with plenty of behind-the-scenes coaching from Mr. Rubin and his deputy, Lawrence H. Summers -- although the United States has committed several billion dollars in backup financing, called a ''second line of defense,'' to South Korea and Indonesia. (None has been disbursed.)
The backup financing is chiefly an exercise in market psychology, intended to reassure investors that the United States is willing to play a big role in stabilizing markets. But that same act of symbolism only incenses many American lawmakers, who ask why taxpayers should bail out faraway nations. The Administration fears that the more it supplements the I.M.F., the greater the risk that Congress will pull the plug on contributions altogether.
The public case for deeper American participation was made by President Clinton in his State of the Union address on Tuesday, when he argued that a prosperous Asia would help American exporters. ''These countries are our customers,'' he said, ''and if Asia sinks into recession, they won't be able to buy the goods we'd like to sell them.''
The private case, one of Mr. Clinton's top aides noted recently, will have to be made by Mr. Rubin. ''Basically, it comes down to this,'' the aide said. ''Bob is going to have to say: 'If the Asian meltdown comes to Wall Street, do you want the blame?' ''
On the streets of Bangkok, Jakarta and Seoul, the I.M.F. era looks pretty grim -- and the popular sentiment, right or wrong, is that the I.M.F. is making it grimmer.
The search for a scapegoat is understandable: Economic activity has ground to a halt. The cranes towering over half-completed buildings don't move, and tens of thousands of workers who headed back to their hometowns last week for the end of Ramadan and the Chinese New Year have been told not to return. The Thai stock market, which had a market capitalization of $133 billion in 1993, the height of the Southeast Asian boom, is now worth about $22 billion. When it comes to buying overseas goods, Indonesia's currency buys 20 percent of what it did a few months ago. The crisis, in short, has hit the streets.
''Things are a lot worse than people expected, and they could get worse yet,'' said Teera Phutrakul, who runs an investment firm along one of Bangkok's busiest commercial streets. ''That's because of a lot of bad decisions made here in Thailand. But now, along comes the I.M.F. to impose some discipline, and it's very, very politically convenient. The Government can say, 'We have no choice -- Michel Camdessus made us do this,' '' he said, referring to the I.M.F.'s managing director.
In Thailand, though, Mr. Camdessus comes off a lot better than President Clinton and Mr. Rubin, whom many in the country's leadership contend were indifferent to Thailand's call for help last summer and only got serious about the Asian crisis when it began to sweep through the continent and around the world. ''The Thais felt quite hurt that they saw no signs of support from the U.S.,'' Defense Secretary William S. Cohen said after returning from a recent tour through Asia. ''It left some wounds'' -- including some suggestions from Thai officials that they may not be so accommodating the next time the United States needs to move its military forces through Thai air bases.
The I.M.F. program in Thailand is typical of the institution's approach in Asia. Weak financial institutions are being closed down. Interest rates have been pushed up sharply, so that investors have an incentive to buy the local currency. To comply with the I.M.F.'s mandate against budget deficits, the Thais have cut their spending by roughly 30 percent, killing many social programs and public-works projects.
Financial firms are being required to use internationally accepted accounting procedures and to disclose far more data than they ever have before. The new rules are intended to expose the kind of under-the-table deals that have long fueled Asian economies while enriching the politically connected. Real regulation is being imposed, including bank supervisors who are supposed to make sure that money is being lent to sound projects, rather than to cronies.
But this new regime of openness in business, and a war on crony capitalism, requires a huge cultural change in the way Asia has always operated -- a change that is hard to impose from half a world away. And it carries with it a lecturing tone that is already stirring up a popular and political backlash.
The United States, of course, is celebrating any changes that move the Asian economies closer to the American model of capitalism and further from the Japanese model. But for ordinary people, the benefits of such a shift are difficult to see through the swirl of fleeing foreign money and plummeting currencies.
So it is hardly surprising that many Asians are seizing on criticisms of the I.M.F. Jeffrey D. Sachs, the Harvard economist who is a longtime critic of the fund, attracts more Asian reporters than a Hong Kong pop star when he shows up at conferences to make his case that the policies are only making matters worse. High interest rates and rampant bank closures, he says, have simply frozen economic activity. ''Even healthy companies cannot get letters of credit to make the exports they need to generate revenue,'' he says. ''Does this make sense?''
OTHER critics, however, say the problem is the I.M.F.'s inability to handle the huge overhang of private, dollar-denominated debt that local companies cannot pay back. In South Korea, this problem is being addressed through an accord with foreign banks that resulted in a tentative deal last week, but there has been no equivalent process in Thailand and Indonesia.
Still other I.M.F. critics, including George Soros, the international financier, say the real problem is the absence of global regulation of global markets. In their view, the international economic and financial order created in the aftermath of World War II, at the Bretton Woods Conference in New Hampshire, needs to be overhauled. That system, of which the I.M.F. and its sister institution, the World Bank, are central elements, worked well for most of the last half-century. But today, these people argue, it has been overwhelmed by 24-hour trading and needs to be updated so it can keep up with the terrifying speed at which money flows in and out of countries.
All of this has left the I.M.F. reeling. It has adjusted its programs slightly to quiet some of the criticism. But its defenders, including Mr. Rubin, say that while Asia is burning, no one should be reorganizing the fire department.
I.M.F. officials, meanwhile, are starting to answer their critics. ''None of this will be easy,'' Stanley Fischer, the No. 2 official in the I.M.F., said in a speech last week. The currency depreciations, Mr. Fischer said, have not ''occurred by I.M.F. design'' and clearly have gone too far. But ''without I.M.F. support as a part of an international effort to stabilize these economies, it is likely that these currencies would have lost still more of their value,'' he added.
Turning to Congressional critics -- whom he was careful not to name -- he said, ''Simply letting the chips fall where they may would surely cause more bankruptcies, larger layoffs, deeper recession and even deeper depreciations than would otherwise be necessary to put these economies back on a sound footing.''
THE I.M.F.'s troubles in Washington start with the conservative right in Congress, which has long mixed a suspicion of Wall Street and big banks with a streak of isolationism. To some on the right, the problem with the I.M.F. is not just the way it has dealt with the Asian crisis, but the institution's very existence.
Republican critics, like Senator Lauch Faircloth of North Carolina and Representative Ron Paul of Texas. say I.M.F. bailouts have proved ineffective and, worse, have distorted the workings of the free market.
They are a form of welfare for the rich, these skeptics contend, insulating banks and investors from losses they deserve to suffer for misjudging risks in overseas markets. Furthermore, the critics say, the rescue efforts sow the seeds of future disasters by reassuring lenders and investors that even if they repeat their mistakes, the fund will always be there to cushion the blow.
By this line of reasoning, the much-hailed Mexican bailout was actually a failure, encouraging investors to roll the dice again in Asia.
''The I.M.F. is welfare for the very rich investors, and serves only to keep afloat reckless political institutions which have policies that destroy their own economies,'' said Mr. Paul, once the Libertarian Party's candidate for President and perhaps the most vocal Congressional critic of the fund.
''The big bankers and investors quite correctly support the notion of less government and economic liberty when we talk about their profits, but when losses occur they are quick to call for the Government to socialize the burden,'' he said on Wednesday, introducing a bill calling for the United States to leave the fund.
While the Clinton Administration views Mr. Paul as the enemy, in private, some officials concede half his point. It is virtually impossible to salvage an ailing economy without also benefiting the banks and investors that poured cash into it. Before the Asian storm clouds turned into a typhoon, Mr. Rubin often raised alarms about the ''moral hazard'' of encouraging reckless investments.
EVEN now, Mr. Rubin takes pains to distance himself from saving big banks and burned investors. ''I would not give one nickel to help any creditor or investor,'' he said recently, noting that the Asian crisis had hurt profits at J. P. Morgan, Chase and Citibank. But in the next breath, Mr. Rubin noted that the issue is ''complex'' because ''any action to force investors and creditors involuntarily to take losses'' would cause all investors to pull their money out of a country -- just at the moment that it needed fresh capital.
Conservatives, however, are hardly the I.M.F.'s only critics in Washington. Some liberals argue that the agency does not demand enough in the way of political and social changes in return for its aid. They want to make the assistance contingent on improvements in human rights, working conditions and environmental standards.
''The American people are going to be very skeptical of any plan to bail out international speculators and repressive regimes that simply encourages them to repeat the same pattern of abuse and excess all over again,'' said Representative David E. Bonior of Michigan, the Democratic whip. ''We cannot support a bailout that imposes an economic stranglehold on working people, tramples democratic rights, ignores the underlying causes of instability and then asks the American taxpayer to foot the bill.''
The I.M.F. is increasingly sensitive to the criticism that it is props up dictators. In Indonesia, it has forced the breakup of monopolies and an end to Government aid to business ventures run by President Suharto's family and friends. But it has steered clear of making political demands -- that Mr. Suharto, for example, lift the repression in East Timor, which was seized two decades ago. And it has not uttered a word about the delicate question of political succession, even though that is the central issue affecting Indonesia's economic future.
''We can attack crony capitalism,'' a senior I.M.F. official said. ''But it's a stretch to make an economic case for an end to human-rights abuses, beyond urging 'good governance.' ''
The Administration hopes to steer clear of these arguments in its effort to persuade Congress to approve $18 billion in new American contributions to the I.M.F. But members of both parties say the price it might have to pay is a severe restriction on its freedom to use the Exchange Stabilization Fund, a $40 billion American kitty for dealing with international currency crises. Now, the Administration can lend the money at its discretion -- just as it did to Mexico in 1995. That prompted Congress to impose a restriction on the use of the exchange stabilization fund that expired just as the Asian crisis broke. Legislation introduced last week would reimpose such a restriction, requiring Congressional approval for dipping into the fund for more than $250 million.
IF Congress worries that I.M.F. bailouts are out of control, Asia worries that Washington secretly runs the I.M.F. And despite Washington's denials, the Asian concerns are not exactly baseless.
The United States has the strongest voice within the fund, an 18 percent voting share, three times that of any other country and enough to wield a veto over major decisions by the fund's board. Moreover, it is often able to persuade other big industrial countries to vote with it, giving Washington a 40 percent voting bloc. Early in the Asian crisis, a senior Administration official boasted this fall, one phone call from Mr. Summers changed key conditions on the Thai bailout.
Still, American power is not absolute. The United States pushed the I.M.F. to provide additional financial aid to Russia two years ago to help prop up the Government of President Boris N. Yeltsin, but the agency's management refused, saying it had lent Russia all that its rules allowed.
Other countries have carved out their own spheres of influence. France considers development of French-speaking nations its prerogative, and Britain has championed an initiative to reduce the debt loads of poor nations.
But when a big crisis arises, the United States usually takes charge, as the fund's handling of the most recent crisis in Indonesia illustrated.
Last month, the United States and the fund worked together to send Mr. Camdessus, Mr. Summers, Defense Secretary Cohen and Mr. Fischer, the I.M.F. official, to Jakarta to pound home a crucial message to President Suharto. In a series of meetings over two days, they pressed upon the Indonesian leader the need to agree to tough terms for emergency loans -- and to implement them promptly.
I.M.F. officials said it was no accident that they all carried the same message to Jakarta -- a message that had also been backed up by phone calls from President Clinton to the Indonesian leader.
''We agreed there had to be a major effort,'' said a senior Fund official. ''We had to get to Suharto, and we had to get him to realize the seriousness of the situation.''
That message was put together in the White House at a meeting presided over by President Clinton, with Mr. Rubin, Mr. Summers and a range of State Department and National Security officials in attendance. Soon Mr. Suharto received calls from leaders around the world, politely telling him he had no choice.
''A remarkable coincidence of timing,'' a senior American official deadpanned during Mr. Summers' trip to Jakarta.

Chart ''Many Ailments, One Prescription''
The International Monetary Fund, typically working in concert with Washington and other Western capitals, has prescribed the tough medicine of austerity as the cure for one sick economy after another. Now the Fund is under attack on many fronts: in Congress, by economists, and on the streets of Asia.
CASE
Mexico, 1994-95
SYMPTOMS
Collapse of the peso amid rampant imports, dwindling foreign reserves and high inflation in an overheated economy.
PRESCRIPTION
Austerity, including a clampdown on credit and wages, in exchange for loans and guarantees led by the United States and backed up by the I.M.F. and other institutions.
CONSEQUENCES
Widespread bankruptcies. Massive job losses. Increased income inequality, poverty and social strife. But the peso stabilized relatively quickly, and within months Mexico regained the trust of foreign lenders.
CASE
Indonesia, 1997-98
SYMPTOMS
Collapse of the rupiah amid an explosion of foreign debt and a sharp stock market slide.
PRESCRIPTION
Austerity and economic restructuring -- including an end to special deals for businesses linked to President Suharto's family, the forced break-up of monopolies, the closure of failing banks and tight limits on government spending -- in exchange for billions in aid from the I.M.F., the United States and other industrial nations.
CONSEQUENCES
Remain to be seen. Analysts expect inflation, unemployment and bankruptcies to skyrocket. The military stands ready to put down social unrest as political opposition to Mr. Suharto begins to emerge. The I.M.F. projects a stagnant economy this year, but renewed growth in 1999. Meanwhile, the rupiah continues to fall.
CASE
South Korea, 1997-98
SYMPTOMS
Collapse of the won and the stock market under staggering foreign debt in a sheltered economy built on crony capitalism.
PRESCRIPTION
Austerity and economic restructuring -- including deep cuts in public spending, tight credit, markets thrown open to imports and foreign investment and the removal of government props for bloated conglomerates -- in return for the biggest I.M.F.-led bailout ever.
CONSEQUENCES
Remain to be seen. Growth is screeching to a halt, and analysts expect a boom in unemployment and bankruptcies. Social unrest remains possible, but the stock market has rebounded and the won has steadied. (pg. 1)
''A World of Troubles''
International Monetary Fund programs take a variety of forms, depending on the depths of a country's economic woes and its ability to repay loans. But hardly a corner of the world has gone without I.M.F. assistance in the last five years. World Map shows countries where the International Monetary Fund has intervened in the last five years.
Program A
Stand-by Arrangements
Cover periods of one to two years and focus on macro-economic policies, like monetary and exchange rates, though they can promote restructuring.
Program B
Extended Fund Facilities
Programs of three to four years intended to overcome balance-of-payments difficulties and restructure economies.
Programs C or D
Structural and Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facilities
Low-cost loan programs to support economic restructuring of low-income countries.
Letters below indicate the type of I.M.F. intervention in each country.

Calmer Trading Overseas Helps Bolster U.S. Stocks

Abstract: Stocks ended higher yesterday, bolstered in part by calmer markets overseas and by expectations that economic slowdowns in Asia and Latin America would keep United States interest rates low. Such expectations overcame, at least for a day, concerns on how the overseas turmoil will hurt profits of American companies. Investors confidence was heightened in part by comments from Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman. He told the House Banking Committee that the problems in Asia and other regions would not threaten prosperity in the United States and could even help hold down inflation. United States stocks were also helped by gains in Hong Kong and Brazilian stocks. The Hang Seng index of 33 stocks, the Hong Kong market's main stock index, rose 112.87 points, or 1.17 percent, at 9,720.78. Brazil's 51-share Bovespa index, which fell 10.2 percent on Wednesday, closed up 250.02 points, or 3.20 percent, at 8,07203 yesterday.

Full text: Stocks ended higher yesterday, bolstered in part by calmer markets overseas and by expectations that economic slowdowns in Asia and Latin America would keep United States interest rates low.
Such expectations overcame, at least for a day, concerns on how the overseas turmoil will hurt profits of American companies. Investors confidence was heightened in part by comments from Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman. He told the House Banking Committee that the problems in Asia and other regions would not threaten prosperity in the United States and could even help hold down inflation.
The turmoil in Asia and Latin America ''ultimately will be beneficial to the U.S. economy, our stock market and also our bond market,'' said Robert Bloom, chief investment officer at the Friends Vilas-Fischer Trust Company in New York, which manages $2.4 billion.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 86.44, or 1.2 percent, to 7,487.76. The Dow began the day with an 87-point gain, tumbled to a 51-point loss and bounced back up again in a furious rally late in the session.
Other market indexes were higher. The Nasdaq composite index rose 16.02 points, or 1 percent, to 1,557.74, and the Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 10.70, or 1.2 percent, to 916.66.
United States stocks were also helped by gains in Hong Kong and Brazilian stocks. The Hang Seng index of 33 stocks, the Hong Kong market's main stock index, rose 112.87 points, or 1.17 percent, at 9,720.78. Brazil's 51-share Bovespa index, which fell 10.2 percent on Wednesday, closed up 250.02 points, or 3.20 percent, at 8,07203 yesterday.
''There's a seesaw going on here,'' said Andrew M. Brooks, vice president in charge of equity trading at T. Rowe Price Associates. ''The Asian situation continues to be troublesome and of concern, and we're struggling to find some direction.''
In Tokyo, the Nikkei index of 225 leading issues recovered from sharp losses to end down just 6.9 points yesterday.
Early today, however, Japanese stocks were lower. At the midday recess in trading, the Nikkei was down 206.29 points, or 1.34 percent, at 15,220.98.
Among individual issues, AT&T rose 2, to 48 3/4, for the biggest percentage rise in the Dow industrials, The Sprint Corporation rose 3 1/4, to 57 1/2, and the BellSouth Corporation gained 11/16, to 49 5/8. Worldcom Inc.'s acquisition of the MCI Communications Corporation puts pressure on big telephone companies to merge or form alliances, analysts say.
Computer-related shares, which plunged on Wednesday on concern that Southeast Asia's financial woes would hurt their profits, rebounded yesterday. Texas Instruments Inc. rose 3 3/4, to 97 1/2, after losing 12 1/2 points yesterday. The Dell Computer Corporation rose 5 1/16, to 77 1/16.
Auto and chemical shares sank. General Motors fell 9/16, to 62 1/4, and The DuPont Company lost 2, to 57.
Oil service stocks fell on concerns that sales cannot increase because drilling rigs are booked solid and that price increases could delay some drilling by oil companies in the future, analysts said. ''That's worrisome in the environment of very robust valuations,'' said Byron Dunn, an analyst with SBC Warburg Dillon Read Inc.
The Cooper Cameron Corporation lost 3 5/8, to 70; Tidewater Inc. fell 3 3/8, to 62, and the Halliburton Company fell 2 13/16, to 53 1/2.

Full text: AuthorAffiliation Norbert Walter is chief economist of the Deutsche Bank Group.
One month, the financial markets are bent over backward because the United States economy is supposedly growing too fast. Interest rates are pushed higher. The next month, fresh statistics cool the inflation fever, and the markets calm down.
But what would really turn America's ''inflation tango'' into something more dangerous would be a broad rise in labor costs. This possibility, which would increase inflationary pressures, seems the main concern of Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve.
Leaving aside the debate about exactly how low the American unemployment rate can fall without fueling inflation, the reality remains that finding talented workers in the American labor market is becoming more difficult.
For a while longer, employers will still be able to draw workers from the ranks of those who until recently were not actively seeking work. Productivity increases have also eased some pressure.
These buffers, though, may not suffice to keep inflation at bay over the long haul. Assuming the American economy keeps growing above 2.75 percent a year, labor will get very scarce -- unless the United States makes more creative use of international labor mobility.
If it can take advantage of this safety valve, I am convinced the United States could have an unemployment rate below 4 percent and still avoid inflation. If the United States doesn't have enough workers, and if low-wage countries like India and China can't provide enough of the highly skilled labor that America needs, then Europe may have the cure.
Though growth forecasts are turning cautiously positive, few analysts predict any meaningful reduction in European unemployment. Europe's pressing need (finding jobs for its people) happily coincides with America's pressing need (finding people for its jobs).
The skills of Europe's work force are particularly well suited to fill this need. Increasingly, the labor shortages threatening the American economy are in the ''new collar'' occupations -- technically skilled jobs in the manufacturing and service industries that require specialized training, but usually not a college degree.
Europe's labor resources are quite rich in these areas, a result of the huge investment in job training made by the continent's corporate and public sectors. This expertise -- in computer-assisted design and manufacturing, for example -- is an ideal fit for the current needs of American business.
Suppose a grand bargain could be arranged whereby many of Europe's unemployed packed up and moved to greener pastures in the United States?
American immigration laws already have provisions that allow the recruitment of skilled labor abroad, but the administration of the law has been uneven at best. Perhaps all that is needed is for the rules to be interpreted more broadly -- or for American employers to make more creative use of them.
If this strategy works, then American corporations would gain a vast pool of qualified workers, many of whom already speak excellent English. The American people would win as inflation fears caused by low unemployment gradually disappeared, pushing down interest rates for consumer loans and home mortgages. The Europeans would finally find solid jobs, and the European governments could slash unproductive social spending.
Is this a pipe dream? If French or German workers won't move just a few miles to find a job in Europe, how can migration across the Atlantic be a credible option? And can the Europeans live without the long vacations and other fringe benefits they have long felt entitled to?
Yes, many Europeans who were raised in an era of generous benefits tend to be immobile. But there is anecdotal evidence that the situation is changing, particularly among the young and better educated.
A German newspaper, the Neue Presse, has reported a sharp rise in the number of Germans inquiring at the American Consulate in Frankfurt about the possibility of immigrating to the United States.
Is it even conceivable that American officials would accept a major increase in immigration? With jobs plentiful and American voters increasingly optimistic about their personal financial prospects, perhaps the needs of the American economy will prevail over politics.
And at this moment, Europe's and America's labor needs are a perfect match.

Abstract: Eduardo Aninat, Chile's Finance Minister, said in an interview that he saw no obstacles in Mexico, Canada, or Chile that would deter the quick approval of Chile as a trade-bloc member that the United States promised at a meeting of Western Hemisphere leaders in Miami last December. "We believe that the United States and Nafta partners are on track with respect to Chile's accession to Nafta," said Charlene Barshefsky, a United States deputy trade representative, in a telephone interview from Washington. "We have met not only as Nafta partners, but working relations are very good and the commitment on the part of all the countries involved is very firm." Claudio S. Garcia, president of Chile's American Chamber of Commerce, which represents United States companies with business interests here, said that the Mexican crisis had "splashed a bucket of cold water on the issue of Chile and Nafta" but that his organization was continuing to lobby in Congress, seeking to shift the tide.

Full text: With negotiations over Chile's admission to the North American free-trade bloc scheduled to begin next month, trade officials and business leaders here are worried that the United States, engulfed in domestic concerns, could delay its promise to bring Chile into the pact.
Eduardo Aninat, Chile's Finance Minister, said in an interview that he saw no obstacles in Mexico, Canada, or Chile that would deter the quick approval of Chile as a trade-bloc member that the United States promised at a meeting of Western Hemisphere leaders in Miami last December.
But Mr. Aninat said that despite bipartisan support in the United States Congress for expanding the North American Free Trade Agreement -- or Nafta, as it is widely known -- Chile's entry may be slowed by fallout from the Mexican devaluation crisis and by gridlock over an ever more complex domestic policy agenda.
"It is a bit dangerous for me to give this opinion, but there is a possibility that they will say, because we are so occupied with upcoming elections and a new Congressional political agenda, 'Chile, come back another time,' " Mr. Aninat remarked.
He said that while such a delay would not be a disaster for Chile, "it will be very disappointing and a very sad point in U.S.-Chilean relations."
Chilean membership in the North American trade group has been anticipated ever since the Bush Administration said in 1992 that Chile, with the most advanced economy in Latin America, would be the next country admitted to the trade group. The Clinton Administration has reiterated that commitment.
The Administration has cited Chile as a test case for economic integration of the Western Hemisphere, in which almost all the countries in the region would reach a trading accord over the next decade.
In the last decade, Chile has become the model for economic change in Latin America as it privatized most state enterprises, slashed tariffs, liberalized investment markets, and opened its doors to foreign capital. The result has been 11 years of uninterrupted growth, with an average annual rate of 7 percent for the last eight years. Inflation slowed to 8.9 percent last year from 15 percent in 1992; unemployment is currently 5 percent, and Chile has one of the highest savings and investment rates in the region.
The United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, said recently that bipartisan support for a free-trade pact with Chile remained strong, and that the Administration was committed to obtaining so-called fast-track authority from Congress this year.
Under such an arrangement, used in gaining approval of both the North American trade accord and the more recent world trade pact, the Administration negotiates the details of an agreement and the House and Senate vote only to approve or block the pact without amendments.
"We believe that the United States and Nafta partners are on track with respect to Chile's accession to Nafta," said Charlene Barshefsky, a United States deputy trade representative, in a telephone interview from Washington. "We have met not only as Nafta partners, but working relations are very good and the commitment on the part of all the countries involved is very firm."
American trade officials said that trade and finance ministers from the United States, Canada, Mexico and Chile are to begin formal negotiations on June 7 and that if all goes well, Congress is expected to vote on an agreement providing for Chilean membership near the end of the year. But expectations that Chile would gain rapid approval have been fading since late December, when Mexico devalued the peso, causing chaos in financial and credit markets in Latin America and sending investors running for cover.
Critics of the North American trade pact in the United States, like Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the House Democratic leader, have called on the Administration to abandon plans to expand the North American agreement to all of Latin America unless regional labor and environmental rules are included. Republicans dismiss any such rules as unacceptable, under pressure from American businesses that fear the same rules may be applied to them in the United States. The controversy has cast uncertainty on the expansion of free trade through the Western Hemisphere.
And the Republican-controlled House has been occupied of late with legislation promised in the Contract With America, and is next expected to emphasize conservatives' agenda items that were not addressed earlier in the year.
Clinton Administration officials say they are uncertain where the Senate stands on expanding the North American trade alliance.
Claudio S. Garcia, president of Chile's American Chamber of Commerce, which represents United States companies with business interests here, said that the Mexican crisis had "splashed a bucket of cold water on the issue of Chile and Nafta" but that his organization was continuing to lobby in Congress, seeking to shift the tide.
"It appears today that there will be difficulty getting fast-track Nafta through the United States Congress," said Gert Rosenthal, executive secretary of the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, which is based here. "If Nafta is delayed for Chile, the biggest casualty will be the spirit of the Miami conference, this concept of Western hemispheric integration that the United States has been promoting."
Mr. Rosenthal said that delaying Chile's entry into the North American trade group would send the wrong message to other Latin Americans and to Asian countries, which the United States is trying to persuade to open markets and broadly liberalize their economies.
Chile, a relatively small nation of 13.5 million people in an area of less than 300,000 square miles, is rich in natural resources like copper, timber, fish, iron ore, nitrates and precious metals. Last year, it had exports of $11.64 billion, of which $2.01 billion went to the United States -- mainly fruit, vegetables and forestry products. Chile imported $11.36 billion last year, of which $2.64 billion came from the United States, including vehicles, electronic equipment and other consumer goods.
Mr. Aninat said he was still optimistic that fast-track authority was possible, and he foresees an approval process in which Congress passes a fast-track measure by September, formal negotiations begin in October, and a draft of a new agreement is sent to Congress in January or February.
Yet some Congressional trade experts consider such a timetable very optimistic, and think that fast-track authority may not be completed until shortly before Christmas.
Mr. Aninat said that if fast-track authority was delayed, the United States would be missing a prime opportunity to establish an early trading agreement with a country where imports are growing 26 percent a year, one seen by many Asian nations as a platform for trade with the rest of Latin America.

Full text: Special to The New York Times
Business people from the United States are flocking to Brazil in a new display of confidence that economic ties between the two giants of the Americas will now revolve around trade and investment.
Even before Brazil's $49 billion commercial debt was rescheduled on April 15, Brazilian and foreign businessmen detected the thundering hoofs of United States investors and exporters.
Sao Paulo, a state with an economy larger than Argentina's, has seen a string of business announcements in recent weeks: Goldman, Sachs & Company, the investment bank, is to open an office here; J. C. Penney, the retailer, is to start a catalogue mail order business, and Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising Worldwide, is opening an advertising agency. Later this year, Wal-Mart Stores is expected to open a discount store in Sao Paulo, its first in Brazil.
"It started last year -- then, all of a sudden, these guys are all over us," said Barry J. Gluck, a United States partner of the Brazilian office of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, referring to the estimated 300 business people from the United States who now visit Sao Paulo each day. Symbol of New Interest
Indeed, as bankers lined up in New York to sign Brazil's foreign-debt deal, United States exporters and investors in Sao Paulo were already exploring the new United States Trade Center, a freshly minted aluminum-and- glass building that symbolizes the new business relationship.
International business interest in Brazil is rising as investors increasingly look beyond the nation's two prominent drawbacks -- a 45 percent monthly inflation rate and a chronically weak central Government -- and see a Latin American economy the size of Russia's.
But while Russia is struggling to recover from the collapse of Communism, Brazil's economy is growing this year on the shoulders of a record grain harvest of 74 million tons, a forecast of an unprecedented output of 1.5 million automobiles, record foreign currency reserves of $37 billion, a healthy trade surplus and a growing appetite for United States imports.
"Russia should only hope to have Brazil's problems," said Paula Stern, an international economist based in Washington. "I'm sensing a new excitement about Brazil."
By relaxing rules and slashing taxes in the early 1990's on profits sent overseas, Brazil stimulated new investor interest, especially in franchising.
"Australia and metropolitan Sao Paulo have about the same population -- 18 million people," Michael K. Lorelli, president of Pizza Hut International, calculated during a visit here in early April. "In Australia, we have 434 Pizza Huts. In Sao Paulo, we have 38. I don't see any reason why we can't double here every two years."
In the last two years, franchising grew in Brazil by 30 percent a year. Economists predict that in 1994 and in 1995, United States franchises alone will expand by 20 percent a year in Brazil.
With United States companies swarming into a once-restricted market, Sao Paulo's fast-food consumers can now choose among Domino's Pizza, Arby's and Kentucky Fried Chicken. Within a year, Taco Bell and Pizza Inn are to enter the market and McDonald's is to open its Latin American training center here, Hamburger University South.
Brazilians, who drink 1.4 billion gallons of soft drinks a year, constitute the world's third-largest soft-drink market, after the United States and Mexico. Opening an aggressive new front in the cola wars, Pepsi-Cola plans to open a new $25 million bottling plant in Rio de Janeiro this year, part of $90 million in investments planned by Pepsi through the end of the decade.
Brazil was long a closed market but abolished its list of banned imports in 1990. Over the last decade, it has slashed average tariffs from 78 percent to 14 percent, near the regional average. In response, foreign imports jumped 25 percent last year, hitting $25 billion. This year, they are expected to jump 20 percent more. Narrower Trade Gap
For the United States, which is Brazil's largest trading partner, this means that the United States' trade deficit with Brazil is expected to drop by half this year, to less than $1 billion.
"It's a new ball game here," said Richard R. Ades, a Commerce Department official who heads the new United States Trade Center here. "The trade gap is narrowing. A lot of American companies are coming down here to appoint distributors."
The number of United States business executives using the services of his office is running at four times last year's level, Mr. Ades said. Last year, 12 official United States trade missions visited Brazil, four times the number in 1992.
United States exports to Brazil increased by 10 percent last year and are expected to rise another 15 percent this year. Underlining Brazil's new importance to United States exporters, Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown will visit Sao Paulo late this month to dedicate the new trade center.
Analysts predict that United States-Brazilian trade will grow steadily in two areas -- computers and tourism. Brazil's imports of United States-made computers and peripherals appear likely to grow by 30 percent a year through 1995. And with more than 700,000 Brazilians expected to visit the United States this year, Brazil could become the fifth-largest source of foreign tourists, after Japan, Germany, Britain and France.
"Brazil has the most dynamic private sector in Latin America," said William R. Rhodes, the Citibank vice chairman who led the creditor banks in the renegotiation of Brazil's foreign debt. A Government's Troubles
The healthy Brazilian business sector contrasts with its sick public sector. Brazilian executives look to the Government with low expectations.
To beat inflation, which reached a record 2,500 percent last year, economists say that Brazil needs to close its budget deficit by cutting Government spending and by collecting more taxes.
Tax collection is up by one-third over last year's levels. But Congress has been reluctant to cut spending with elections looming on Oct. 3. Brazil's President, Itamar Franco, whose term winds up at the end of this year, recently signed a measure allowing for the return to work of 108,000 federal employees dismissed during the previous Government.
A privatization program cycles along at a modest pace. One state company has been sold so far this year. In May, auctions are to be held for a state shipping line and for the state aircraft manufacturer. In June, seven state petrochemical companies are to be auctioned to private bidders.
A new economic plan to reduce inflation before the presidential election was disclosed in March by Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who subsequently resigned as Economy Minister to run for president as Mr. Franco's successor.
"It's a plan of electoral opportunism," said Paulo Rabello de Castro, chairman of SR Rating, a new credit rating company in Rio de Janeiro. "Inflation could go down to 5 or 10 percentage points. But that is nothing new; Brazilian governments have already done that several times. But it won't be permanent."
If the plan is successful in the short term, it will probably set off a consumer spending boom, sending Brazil's growth rate back up to the 5 percent registered last year. But if Mr. Cardoso's plan fails, the election will probably be won by his foremost rival, Luis Inacio Lula da Silva, a socialist who has led opinion polls by a 2-to-1 margin over any challenger, including Mr. Cardoso.
When Mr. da Silva visits New York and Washington this week, he is expected to reassure United States investors that he supports foreign investment, free trade and the recent reworking of Brazil's foreign debt. Beyond Politics
Yet the flow of investment suggests that many Brazilian and foreign business people are gambling that there is limited damage a new president can do, whatever his ideological stripe. While few Brazilian business executives back Mr. da Silva, Brazilian and foreign companies here are going ahead with investment plans totaling $45 billion for this year, the highest level in five years.
"Even with its mind-boggling inflation last year, the economy grew by 5 percent in real terms and the manufacturing was up 9 percent," said Jeffrey E. Garten, the United States Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade, who visited Sao Paulo last month.
"The business community is optimistic that Brazil is about to turn the corner," said Mr. Garten, a former New York investment banker. "Business is booming. Foreign investors are clamoring to get in."

Abstract: It appears that fear of inflation and uncertainty about when the Federal Reserve may raise short-term interest rates again are still the main reasons for the collapse in the bond market, which began when the Fed raised its short-term interest rate target a quarter-point on Feb. 4. Although many market analysts argue that the rise in interest rates has already been more than enough to offset another increase by the Fed, traders and analysts are still uncertain whether the rise has reached its peak. Many economists also argue that fears of inflation are overblown, given the current economic data and the apparent determination of the Fed to resist price increases. "If the Fed moves quickly, I think the bonds can improve from where they are now. But if the Fed continues to drag its feet, any improvement will be limited because investors are waiting for further tightening by the Fed." The faster the Fed moves, he said, the more the market will become convinced that the central bank is doing the right thing to stave off inflation in 1995, 1996 and beyond. "If it moves slowly, the Fed will have justified the market's concern that inflation is a problem," he said. The Fed moved at the right time in February, he said, but the increase was not big enough to calm the inflation fears of the bond market.

Full text: Prices of Treasury securities plunged yesterday, pushing up the yield on the 30-year bond to 6.95 percent, its highest level in more than nine months.
Long-term interest rates, which move in the opposite direction of bond prices, are now more than a percentage point above the 25-year low reached on Oct. 15 and nearly three-quarters of a point higher than in early February. For the Clinton Administration, which has based its hope for steady economic growth on the lift from low long-term interest rates, the selloff in the bond market must be raising concerns.
Some traders sought to explain yesterday's selling by pointing to the uncertainty generated by the investigation into the Whitewater land deal and the political unrest in South Africa, the world's largest gold producer, which pushed up gold prices sharply. Fears of Inflation
But it appears that fear of inflation and uncertainty about when the Federal Reserve may raise short-term interest rates again are still the main reasons for the collapse in the bond market, which began when the Fed raised its short-term interest rate target a quarter-point on Feb. 4. Although many market analysts argue that the rise in interest rates has already been more than enough to offset another increase by the Fed, traders and analysts are still uncertain whether the rise has reached its peak. Many economists also argue that fears of inflation are overblown, given the current economic data and the apparent determination of the Fed to resist price increases.
With no fresh data to support the bond market yesterday, investors looked for an excuse to change their investment strategy or sell. Traders said investors who were selling long-term securities turned around and bought short-term Treasury bills, which are less volatile and risky when the market outlook is unclear. A Shift to Shorter Maturities
In late trading, the price of the 30-year bond fell 1 1/2 points, to 917/32 . The yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 6.95 percent, up from 6.83 percent on Wednesday and the highest since May 1993, when it was 6.98 percent. The rush by some investors to seek the shelter of the shorter maturities lifted the bill market. The three-month bill rate fell 3 basis points, to 3.48 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of 1 percent.
Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Securities Inc., said, "The fact remains that there is simply no demand for Treasuries with investors knowing that the Fed is going to hike interest rates soon."
He said traders and investors, by selling relentlessly last month, had pushed interest rates much higher than what could be justified by the economic outlook. He added that investors might be realizing that the inflation they were concerned about was not a problem for 1994, although it could be an issue in 1995 or beyond.
"We don't know yet if the economy will even be strong enough to produce inflation in those years," Mr. Fine said.
Joseph V. Battipaglia, managing director of Sterling Advisers, said investors were in a selling mood yesterday and were looking for any excuse to sell. But he argued that "everything in market said you should have been a buyer, not a seller."
Mr. Battipaglia said a reference to gold as a gauge of inflation expectations by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, in Congressional testimony last month had made gold a fashionable measure for investors. "And a spike in the price of gold like we had today might spook bond investors," Mr. Battipaglia said.
The gold contract for April delivery jumped $8.10, to $388.20 an ounce, in trading on the Commodity Exchange in New York yesterday. "The market is sending a clear message that the Fed has not done enough," Mr. Fine said.
"If the Fed moves quickly, I think the bonds can improve from where they are now. But if the Fed continues to drag its feet, any improvement will be limited because investors are waiting for further tightening by the Fed."
The faster the Fed moves, he said, the more the market will become convinced that the central bank is doing the right thing to stave off inflation in 1995, 1996 and beyond. "If it moves slowly, the Fed will have justified the market's concern that inflation is a problem," he said. The Fed moved at the right time in February, he said, but the increase was not big enough to calm the inflation fears of the bond market.
Some reports that should have helped the market yesterday included the weekly report on initial claims for unemployment benefits for the week that ended on Saturday. The number of Americans filing claims increased by 32,000, to 346,000. Today's report on retail sales for February may draw some attention, traders said, but it is next week's inflation numbers that are more important. The producer price and consumer price indexes for February will be released on Tuesday and Wednesday. China Bonds
Elsewhere in the debt markets, the Bank of China, a bank owned by the Government of China, received an enthusiastic reception yesterday for an issue of five-year bonds, but an issue of 20-year bonds, the longest yet issued by a Chinese agency, did not do as well.
The $400 million issue of five-year bonds was priced to yield 6.819 percent, or 98 basis points above comparable Treasury securities. The initial sale was completed, and the lead underwriters, Morgan Stanley & Company, allowed the bonds to be traded freely.
The $100 million issue of 20-year bonds, which was priced to yield 8.281 percent, or 135 basis points above comparable Treasury securities, was bid by Morgan Stanley at a 140 basis point spread, a lower price.
Jim Pelgrift, a bond syndicate manager for Morgan Stanley, said some of the 20-year bonds remained to be sold.
Although not formally guaranteed by the Government of China, the bonds were priced as if they were, reflecting the Government's support of the bank.

Abstract: The Paris-based organization, which promotes economic cooperation among its 24 member nations, said in a new study that "there is good reason to expect inflation to remain below 3 percent," but added that with short-term rates so low, unemployment edging down and factory utilization rising, monetary tightening could be justified to head off a resurgence of inflation. In its annual grading of America's economic performance, the organization -- which normally takes a tough stance on inflation -- added that "tightening could also be justified if" inflationary "expectations need a jolt and the Federal Reserve's credibility is endangered." 'Real' Rates: Zero Percent The O.E.C.D. expressed concern that "real" short-term rates -- nominal rates minus the inflation rate -- were zero percent. Mr. [Peter Jarrett] said rates at that level were highly stimulative and could reignite inflation.

Full text: Special to The New York Times
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development predicted today that the Federal Reserve would soon push up short-term interest rates because of concerns that the inflation rate had stopped falling.
The Paris-based organization, which promotes economic cooperation among its 24 member nations, said in a new study that "there is good reason to expect inflation to remain below 3 percent," but added that with short-term rates so low, unemployment edging down and factory utilization rising, monetary tightening could be justified to head off a resurgence of inflation.
In its annual grading of America's economic performance, the organization -- which normally takes a tough stance on inflation -- added that "tightening could also be justified if" inflationary "expectations need a jolt and the Federal Reserve's credibility is endangered." 'Real' Rates: Zero Percent
Peter Jarrett, the economist who wrote the study, said in an interview that if the Fed decided to raise short-term rates, that should not in turn push up long-term interest rates, because the Fed would be showing its determination to keep inflation low.
The O.E.C.D. expressed concern that "real" short-term rates -- nominal rates minus the inflation rate -- were zero percent. Mr. Jarrett said rates at that level were highly stimulative and could reignite inflation.
Fed officials declined today to respond to the report.
In what was probably the most pointed section of its report, the organization criticized the Clinton Administration's efforts to pressure Japan to open its markets and agree to specific targets for reducing its trade surplus and increasing imports. The report said this approach ran the risk of creating managed trade, and might result in the "cartelization" of Japanese markets.
It also questioned the usefulness of Washington's pressure campaign, saying that even if the Clinton Administration succeeded in persuading Japan to reduce trade barriers, this was unlikely to do much to reduce the American trade deficit with Japan.
Mr. Jarrett said the Clinton Administration challenged this part of the report more than any other. The Administration has repeatedly argued that efforts to press Japan to import more promotes freer trade, rather than managed trade. Sees More Growth
Each year the O.E.C.D.'s secretariat issues a report that assesses the economic policies and problems of each member nation.
The study forecast a slight rise in American economic growth to a moderate 3 percent next year, with an increase in the trade deficit and another moderate drop in the unemployment rate, currently 6.8 percent.
"While this may appear to some as a disappointing picture, it is actually rather satisfactory," the report said. The organization was less sanguine about long-term growth prospects, saying the nation's potential growth rate was a lackluster 2.3 percent.
In another piece of bad news, the report said that because of slow productivity growth, the United States would lose its worldwide lead in productivity per worker within a decade. Probably the biggest long-term problem for the American economy, the O.E.C.D. said, is inadequate savings. This holds back the nation's ability to increase educational skills and expand plants and equipment, in turn inhibiting productivity growth.
After years of criticizing the United States for not tackling its budget deficit, the organization praised President Clinton's deficit-reduction efforts, but suggested that a new round of cuts might be required by 1998.

Vague Mexico Wage Pledge Clouds Free Trade Accord

Abstract: Mr. [Carlos Salinas de Gortari]'s pledge was not enough to quell all complaint. Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the House majority leader, said Mr. Salinas's promise fell short because so few Mexican workers receive just the minimum wage. Last week he said he would vote against the agreement. 10 Percent Get Minimum According to the Bank of Mexico, the minimum wage now applies to only about 10 percent of Mexican workers, and the Mexican Social Security system reports that only 16 percent of its 8.8 million enrollees receive the minimum wage. But the practice has developed in Mexico of using increases in the minimum wage as the basis for negotiation involving salaries higher than the minimum. Some higher-paid workers, mostly Government employees, would be directly affected because their salaries are calculated as multiples of the minimum wage.

As they try to make the case for Congressional approval of a free trade agreement with Mexico and Canada, President Clinton and other supporters repeatedly say the pact will raise minimum wages in Mexico and reduce the country's ability to undercut businesses north of the border with cheap labor.
But by focusing on how minimum wages might rise, the Clinton Administration has put itself in a somewhat awkward position because that particular pledge is not found anywhere in the 2,000-page North American Free Trade Agreement it is meant to support. Nor is it in the special side agreements to the pact, or in Mexican labor law. A Promise by Salinas
Rather it is a personal promise made by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico that this country's minimum wage -- which can go as low as $4 a day, depending on the type of work -- will be increased in tandem with increases in worker productivity.
Mr. Salinas's pledge, announced publicly in August on the same day the side accords were announced, was seen as crucial to getting the pact past a worried United States Congress.
But the pledge was so vague, and the issue of measuring productivity so potentially troublesome, that Mr. Salinas is now under pressure to come forward with a concrete plan for lifting the incomes of Mexico's poorest workers.
Mexican officials have said only that their Departments of Labor and Economic Development are working with their National Commission of Minimum Salaries to devise a formula for the increases.
Labor unions say they have reached an agreement with the Government to give bonuses to productive workers in specific industries, but that does not seem to meet the letter of Mr. Salinas's pledge. Beyond that, little is known on either side of the border about what Mexico will actually do.
"Nobody really has a good understanding of what they're going to do," said Mauricio Gonzalez, a partner at a Mexico City consulting company.
If an accurate and reliable format could be worked out, linking productivity to wage increases could go far toward returning the Mexican work force to the standard of living it had before the debt crisis of 1982 brought soaring inflation and a deep national recession. But the average American factory worker is 4.6 times more productive than the average Mexican factory worker, although in some new Mexican plants the rates can be roughly comparable. Still, few believe that Mexico can close the gap quickly.
It is also not clear how Mexico would manage productivity-based increases, or when they would become effective. Mexican officials say it is doubtful that anything could be in place by the beginning of January, when they hope the trade agreement will be signed and in force.
The Mexican negotiators of the pact were careful not to commit themselves to wage parity with the United States. Mexico is going to try only to make up for some of the losses suffered by workers over the last decade, when the buying power of the minimum wage dropped 60 percent.
There is even uncertainty about what Mr. Salinas's pledge actually means. "We will be assured of an effective and permanent improvement of minimum wages now and for the future," Mr. Salinas said in a speech in which he outlined the plan.
Harley Shaiken, a labor economist at the University of California at Berkeley, said, "As a statement of intent it is a preamble, but the devil is in the details, and this has no details."
A United States Labor Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Clinton Administration was using Mr. Salinas's pledge because of the "symbolic value" it represented. The official said a new system would have a practical, though limited, effect on shrinking the gap between wages in the United States and Mexico. Clinton Stresses Pledge
Despite that, the pledge has become a key part of Mr. Clinton's efforts to sell the pact. In a speech in New Orleans this month, the President praised the trade agreement and the side accords -- one on the environment, the other on labor -- that are intended to toughen parts of the original pact, which lowers or eliminates tariffs on most goods traded between the United States, Mexico and Canada.
The side agreement on labor, Mr. Clinton said, "commits the Mexican Government to enforce its own labor laws, and you should know what that really means."
"It means that for the first time in history a government has committed itself to raise the minimum wage as its economy grows, thereby raising the wage structure throughout the country," he said.
But Mr. Salinas's pledge was not enough to quell all complaint. Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the House majority leader, said Mr. Salinas's promise fell short because so few Mexican workers receive just the minimum wage. Last week he said he would vote against the agreement. 10 Percent Get Minimum
According to the Bank of Mexico, the minimum wage now applies to only about 10 percent of Mexican workers, and the Mexican Social Security system reports that only 16 percent of its 8.8 million enrollees receive the minimum wage. But the practice has developed in Mexico of using increases in the minimum wage as the basis for negotiation involving salaries higher than the minimum. Some higher-paid workers, mostly Government employees, would be directly affected because their salaries are calculated as multiples of the minimum wage.
But as in the United States, increases in the minimum wage do not necessarily result in across-the-board increases. In the United States, the minimum wage has been increasing while average wages have fallen.
In Mexico, there are actually 264 minimum wages; each of 88 different occupations has three minimums that vary according to where the jobs are performed. In general, wages are highest in Mexico City and other urban areas, and lowest in rural states.
Minimum wages are set by the National Commission of Minimum Salaries, which is made up of representatives from business, labor unions and the Government. From 1986 to last January, the commission changed the levels 16 times. Government Deeply Involved
The Government's involvement is an essential part of Mr. Salinas's efforts to tame inflation and keep investors interested in Mexico. Under a set of wage and price controls in effect since 1987, just before Mr. Salinas took office, businesses and unions have kept negotiated wage increases below the level of inflation, while the Government agreed to keep down gasoline and electricity prices while also pumping money into a public works programs called Solidarity.
The program has worked. Inflation is below 10 percent for the first time in 25 years. Despite a slowing of Mexico's economic growth, investment has continued strong. There has even been some recovery in real wages over the last few years. But it has not been enough to compensate for staggering losses of the 1980's. Real wages today are 68 percent of what they were in 1980.
All that has worsened the gap between wages in the United States and Mexico, even though Mexican productivity has been increasing by 4 percent or more each year since 1989. Mexican compensation was 22 percent of United States wages in 1980. It dropped to 7 percent in 1987 and since has risen to 15 percent, according to a report by the Democratic Study Center, a nonprofit academic foundation in Washington.
"We don't expect that in three, four or five years we will have the same minimum salaries as the United States," said Juan S. Millan Lizarraga, secretary of education for the Confederation of Mexican Workers, the largest labor syndicate in Mexico. "But we expect to cut the gap."

At older plants like the Ford factory in Cuautitlan, above, near Mexico City, productivity is at lower levels than in the United States, while at newer plants it is about equal.

Full text: When inflation in the United States is out of control, as it was in the 1970's and early 80's, it is the talk of the land and topples Presidents. When it is under control people just don't seem to notice it.
Well, for the record, inflation in the United States should dip this year to its lowest sustained level since the beginning of the 1970's.
This is not a flash in the pan. The data would cover the 10-year period through the end of 1992. If the Consumer Price Index for the United States rises only 3 percent this year -- and it is moving at that pace right now -- prices will have risen just 3.8 percent a year on average in the last decade. That would be the slowest 10 years' worth of inflation since the same 3.8 percent in the period that ended in 1973.
There has not been a 10-year period in which consumer prices rose at an average annual rate of less than 3 percent since 1961 to 1970, when the average was 2.77 percent. Trend Among Industrial Nations
America's industrial allies have seen similarly tame inflation, from Britain and Germany to Australia and New Zealand. Inflation in the 23 most industrialized countries could average 3.9 percent a year for the last decade, according to International Monetary Fund data. That would be the lowest level for the group since the 3.82 percent figure for the 10 years that ended in 1972.
This should be good news for the consumer and the bond market although there has been quite a cost for this success. In the United States it was the steep recessions of 1980 and 1981 and, later, the four years of either minimal growth or recession since 1988 that undermined President Bush's chances for re-election.
But low inflation has its benefits, one of the most important being the opportunity for a longer period of sustained growth in the economy.
There are numerous signs of continued moderate inflation in the United States. Despite the somewhat surprising rise of four-tenths of one percent in the Consumer Price Index for October, reported Friday, several analysts said they were not worried, in part because one-time factors, like increases in airline fares, contributed to the overall jump. Inflation Scenario Discounted
Closely watched inflation monitors, like the Commodity Research Bureau's index, are declining. What ismore, both the recent rise of the dollar, which makes imports less expensive, and slow growth in Europe, which cuts demand for American products, should both help restrain inflationary pressures.
"There is just no inflation scenario," said Rudiger Dornbusch, professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "You need 3.5 percent growth for three or four years to get a crunch."
Still, it seems that traders and investors in the bond market, which is ultrasensitive to price movements, have yet to believe the inflation story.
Some analysts contend that long-term rates, given the recent inflation performance, should be lower than the 7.57 percent yield on Friday on the new 30-year bond. This belief was the basis for many of the projections, now generally abandoned, that long-term rates would soon fall below 7 percent.
"I still don't believe that most bond investors believe we are looking at a major structural break in inflation," said Edward Yardeni, chief economist at C. J. Lawrence. "I think the bond market is still very concerned about a rebound in inflation."
Others believe that in the next year the story on low inflation will finally sink in and bring down bond yields. Mr. Yardeni said the inflation downdraft could pull rates on the long bond close to 6 percent. Others are more conservative, projecting a fall to around 7.25 or 7 percent.
But there are others who think that much of the inflation story is reflected in the market already, which means that other factors -- like the performance of the Clinton Administration -- will have more impact on the future course of bond yields.
"I don't think that the bond market is misinterpreting the inflation facts," said Richard B. Hoey, chief economist at the Dreyfus Corporation. What worries the market, he said, is not an expected rise in inflation in the near term but the "uncertainty about the economic policy of the Clinton Administration."
"The difference between the bulls and the bears," he said, "is not about what inflation will be in 1993, but about what economic policy will be in 1993, 1994 and 1995. There is a fear we won't deal with the deficit." 'Crowding Out' Feared More
John Lipsky, the chief economist at Salomon Brothers, said the concern in the market now is not inflation but of "crowding out," a term that became popular early in the Reagan Administration. It is the worry that with a rising Federal budget deficit the borrowing demands of the Treasury will "crowd out" the private-sector demand for borrowing. And this, the theory goes, will lead to higher interest rates.
Nancy J. Kimelman, chief economist at Technical Data in Boston, takes a different view. She says investors and traders are already correctly interpreting a Clinton Presidency. The current interest rate on the 30-year bond, she said, assumes that inflation will rise under Mr. Clinton.
"I am not sure that the market is wrong in assessing that Clinton will mean higher bond yields than Bush," she said. Mr. Clinton, she said, wants to get the economy growing to create more jobs. And this, she acknowledged, will probably mean higher inflation.
"The bond market knows that sluggish growth, no real improvement in incomes, and austerity are not the American way," she said. "And everyone knew that the deficit was at a record level, and they still elected Bill Clinton."

Full text: Special to The New York Times
The head of the International Monetary Fund went to bat today for central bankers humiliated by this week's crisis in European currency markets, asserting that the underlying reason for the chaos was less-than-stellar policy making by elected officials.
In a news conference, Michel Camdessus, the fund's managing director, singled out Germany's Government, saying its failure to rein in its huge budget deficit had virtually forced its central bank to raise interest rates.
And in an interview with a French newspaper, he urged the United States to play a more active role in calming Europe's market turbulence. Recognizing the powerful role the United States plays in the world economy, he said, "You cannot stabilize international markets without the cooperation of the United States." 'Not Enough on the Budget Side'
The high German rates had forced other European countries, many of them in or near recession, to raise their rates to keep their currencies from falling against the mark. This week, despite large-scale central-bank intervention, the British pound, Italian lira and Spanish peseta, under the attack of currency speculators, had to be devalued.
"If we went through these tensions, it's probably because not enough was done on the budgetary side," Mr. Camdessus said.
He spoke two days before the world's central bankers and finance ministers gather here for the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. He also spoke two days before a meeting of Group of Seven finance ministers in Washington.
Asked whether Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank, has been too tough in raising its key rates above 9 percent to cut inflation, Mr. Camdessus responded: "I wouldn't say that. I would say that too much burden has been put on them."
Mr. Camdessus insisted that the European currency crisis could end up strengthening Europe's system of fixed exchange rates rather than weakening it.
"In spite of the formidable turmoil of the last few days, the system has once again demonstrated its remarkable resilience," he said.
In the interview with the French newspaper Les Echos, Mr. Camdessus asserted that the crisis in Europe stemmed in large part from the huge gap between America's low interest rates and Germany's stratospheric rates.
This gap pushed the mark so high that it became difficult for other European countries to keep their rates linked to the German currency. He criticized America's huge budget deficit, saying that because the deficit made it difficult for Washington to use fiscal policy to stimulate the economy, the burden fell on the Federal Reserve to keep cutting rates. U.S. Emphasizes Growth
With the United States economy anemic for the last three years, the Bush Administration has been pressing other industrial nations to put more emphasis on growth. In a news briefing today, David C. Mulford, Under Secretary of the Treasury, said he welcomed this week's currency devaluations as well as Monday's interest rate cut by the German central bank, saying they would help spur economic expansion worldwide.
Mr. Mulford said this week's actions showed the Europeans were finally backing the American approach.
The week's decisions in Europe "were very, very important," he said.
"They reflect a recognition of the consensus that has been building -- the United States has been promoting these views for about a year and a half now -- of the importance of strengthening world growth."
He said he was optimistic that Germany's central bank would cut rates again. "As you look forward, I think you can say that in due course in Germany, we will look forward to lower interest rates," he said. 'That's clearly the signal that they've sent." He added that the timing of that was "a complex matter."
Mr. Mulford said the United States had been "relatively unaffected" by Europe's currency crisis, although he expressed concern that turmoil in currency markets could spill over into other financial markets. But he said Europe again was stabilizing, so there was "a minimum of risk" for such financial market turmoil.
He said that at Saturday's Group of Seven meeting, the finance ministers would discuss developments in currency markets, as well as ways to spur world growth, help the developing world, and aid the former Soviet bloc as it adopted a market economy.
The seven ministers will meet with Russia's Deputy Prime Minister, Alexandr Shokhin, to discuss that nation's economic reforms, and they will also debate a plan to grant large-scale debt relief to Russia.
As Mr. Camdessus described it, the agenda for next week's I.M.F.-World Bank meeting will largely overlap that of the Group of Seven meeting. At the I.M.F. session, ministers will discuss how to end the economic doldrums in the industrialized world, how to help the former Communist world stabilize and grow, and, in his words, how to "consolidate and generalize the progress we observe in many developing countries."
Mr. Camdessus complained that many industrial countries had not pursued their commitments to get their economic houses in order. The I.M.F.'s World Economic Outlook, a semiannual report that was issued Wednesday, criticized the United States, Germany, Britain and Italy for not doing nearly enough to reduce their deficits. He said the large deficits were placing too much weight on central banks to run economic policy.
I.M.F. officials say the large deficits are slowing growth worldwide by pushing up long-term interest rates and by diverting money for consumption that could be used for private investment to build for the future.

U.S. Trade Pact a Spur To Canada

Abstract: Even Mr. [Brian Mulroney], who usually strikes a friendly pose toward the United States, has been hotly critical, using terms like "unacceptable" and "counterproductive" and accusing Americans of "sideswiping Canada." And, illustrating the degree of resentment are the widely quoted remarks of Simon Reisman, the man Mr. Mulroney appointed to lead the Canadian free-trade negotiating team in the late 1980's. "The Americans are bastards," he told an interviewer earlier this year. "They're behaving like real thugs these days in protecting their interests." Maude Barlow, an adviser on women's issues during the early 1980's Liberal leadership of Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, heads the Ottawa-based Council of Canadians, the chief lobby against free trade. She said her group would begin a campaign this fall to abrogate the 1989 pact "with brochures, buttons, cross-country tours, town hall meetings, the works" and is "forming alliances with like-minded organizations in the United States and Mexico, to bring our experiences to bear." "It's time to blow the whistle on the free- trade blame game," said Michael Wilson, Canada's International Trade Minister. "Despite the problems generated by a tough global recession, a spate of difficult disputes with the United States and a deep slide in public support for the free trade agreement in Canada, there is now clear evidence that the free trade agreement is working."

Full text: Special to The New York Times
New economic studies indicate that Canada has become more competitive as a result of its trade agreement with the United States and, some analysts believe, is about to outpace all major industrial nations in economic growth. Yet Prime Minister Brian Mulroney faces a herculean task over the next six months in getting the House of Commons to ratify an expansion of the treaty to include Mexico.
The Prime Minister's Government is expected reach agreement on the treaty with Mexico and the United States in coming weeks.
Despite the signs of increased strength -- manufacturing output rose four tenths of 1 percent in 1991, for example -- Canada is still suffering, along with much of the rest of the world, from the persistent effects of recession. And the current trade agreement between the United States and Canada, which came into force Jan. 1, 1989, is getting much of the blame; Canadians are upset about recent plant closings, continued joblessness and the flight of some businesses to the United States.
From a three-way arrangement, Canada is looking not only to preserve trade gains with the United States but to increase its access to Mexico's thriving market.
Canada's trade with Mexico is still modest -- $3 billion a year of two-way business, or only 1.5 percent of exchanges with the United States. Mexico enjoys a huge surplus -- $2 billion last year, chiefly reflecting shipment to Canada of Mexican-assembled cars of the Big Three. Canada last year, for example, imported 41,000 Cavaliers. Canadians also bought nearly $100 million of Mexico's fruits and vegetables.
"People are really very angry," Joan Fawcett, a Liberal Party member of the Ontario Provincial Parliament, said. "They feel these closings are a direct result of free trade -- and that the Canadian Government sold them a bill of goods."
Polls show ardent criticism of the 1989 agreement. The latest survey of the Angus Reid Group has found that 64 percent of Canadians oppose the proposed North American treaty -- and 66 percent are still against the initial agreement with the United States.
Only 6 percent believe that Canada has won any benefits at all in the accord with Washington, which by 1999 virtually eliminates all trade barriers between the two nations.
The provincial governments of Ontario and British Columbia have gone so far as to demand that Canada walk away from the negotiating table.
Many Canadians think that President Bush wants a new free trade deal to boost himself politically. Ontario's Trade Minister, Ed Philip, sounded a popular note here when he commented the other day: "Helping to get George Bush elected by signing on to a dubious free trade deal is not part of Canada's economic agenda."
Still, no one expects Mr. Mulroney to pull out of the talks, and in the end most analysts think the Canadian Parliament will go along with the agreement -- that its great economic dependence on the United States leaves it no other choice.
In fact, neither the United States nor Mexico was initially keen on Canada's participation, fearing Ottawa would only complicate already fiendishly difficult negotiations. But Canada insisted on joining because of its "vital interests," a term Ottawa used repeatedly.
Canada, Mexico and the United States are now trying to create what eventually would become a single market for North America's 370 million people. The agreement is expected to be initialed within a few weeks and come up for ratification later in the legislative bodies of all three countries.
Despite the naysayers, many Canadian economists insist that treaty has had strongly positive effects. New studies are showing that free trade has quietly helped manufacturers reverse a long-term decline in productivity, made Canadian enterprises more global and given Canada a supranational judicial process providing a measure of protection against arbitrary American trade decisions.
A University of Toronto analysis has found that freer trade has stimulated growth, lowered the rate of inflation and lessened the severity of the recession. The researchers found that Canada's output of goods and services last year was four-tenths of a percent higher than it would have been without the free trade agreement; unemployment was down one-tenth of a percent and inflation was seven-tenths of a percent lower. The International Monetary Fund and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development have both recently predicted that Canada, energized by free trade, is about to become the fastest growing of the major industrial countries.
"Things are looking up," said Allan R. Taylor, chairman of the Royal Bank of Canada, the nation's biggest bank, adding, "It is ludicrous to argue, as many are doing, that Canada would somehow have been more protected in the current recession without the free trade agreement."
Trade liberalization, combined with anti-inflation policies, deficit control and industrial deregulation have put Canada in the position, according to Mr. Taylor, where "our costs and prices are finally under control," adding that "they are now running below those of the United States." The Results U.S. Companies Expand in Canada
In contrast to the highly publicized plant closings, many large companies are quietly expanding in Canada to serve the North American market. American multinationals in Canada, it is estimated, have created at least as many jobs as they have terminated.
Figures from the Government's Statistics Canada agency show a net loss of 403,000 manufacturing jobs and a net gain of 185,000 service jobs since Jan. 1, 1989. But Doug Drew, manager of the statistical agency's Labor Force Survey, said it was not clear how much of the changes reflect freer trade and how much Canada's recession.
The stakes for Canada in an expanded trade zone are unusually high because trade with the United States is so closely linked to its own prosperity. More than 75 percent of its exports went to the United States last year, while almost 70 percent of its imports came from the United States. Exports to the United States, a market 10 times larger than Canada's, account for 20 percent of Canada's gross domestic product. No other country -- not even Germany's trading partners in Europe -- are so economically dependent on a neighbor.
Together the United States and Canada do $200 billion of trade with each other, representing the largest commercial relationship in the world. The opening up of new markets in Mexico should help diversify Canada's trade and reduce dependence on the United States.
Procter & Gamble, with 94,000 employees worldwide, says it has capitalized on freer trade to create 200 additional jobs in Canada in the production of specialty soaps and hygienic products for North American distribution. At Pointe Claire, outside Montreal, it has a new pump-soap production line. At Belleville, in southern Ontario, it has just started another operation for the Always panty liner.
"We've been able to take the opportunities created by the free trade agreement for moving product and raw materials across the border more cheaply," said Margaret Bawden, manager of public affairs for Procter & Gamble's Canadian subsidiary. "We find some operations in Canada now more cost effective."
Others taking advantage of lower tariffs to expand are Dow Chemical, Cargill Foods, Du Pont, Rubbermaid, GTE Sylvania, Hughes Aircraft and Kodak.
Freer trade has also accelerated industrial reorganization, as companies seek to operate more efficiently and cut their production costs. The readjustment has been painful in some instances. Jobs indeed have been lost, though in some cases the cause may be an isolated downturn in business, not the lower trade barriers.
Cooper Industries, for example, recently closed a plant near Coburg in southern Ontario that employed 200 people who made hand-held steel files for removing and smoothing metal or wood. Brock McCloskey, a vice president of employee relations, said the operation was consolidated in Cullman, Ala., where the company already had a larger file-making plant.
He said the move had "nothing to do with free trade," adding, "We had excess capacity in both plants and consolidated into one to best utilize manufacturing capacity." The Rivalry Canadians Remain Suspicious of U.S.
If free trade has become the agreement the Canadian people love to hate, part of that feeling stems from the belief among not only the people but also Government officials that the United States continues to use its economic power to keep Canada down in a number of critical sectors, including autos, lumber, steel, beer and apparel. Or, at least, to exact as many advantages as it can before 1999.
Even Mr. Mulroney, who usually strikes a friendly pose toward the United States, has been hotly critical, using terms like "unacceptable" and "counterproductive" and accusing Americans of "sideswiping Canada." And, illustrating the degree of resentment are the widely quoted remarks of Simon Reisman, the man Mr. Mulroney appointed to lead the Canadian free-trade negotiating team in the late 1980's. "The Americans are bastards," he told an interviewer earlier this year. "They're behaving like real thugs these days in protecting their interests."
In recent weeks the United States has threatened to hit Canadian exports of steel and beer.
American steelmakers have accused the Canadians of "dumping" steel, or selling it in the United States at below cost, a violation of United States law. If the American industry can prove its case, higher tariffs would be forced on Canadian steel.
But the Canadians say any such action would make a mockery of free trade. They say that because of the recession and the high degree of integration of the North American steel market, they cannot help but sell below cost in the United States.
The American complaint "amounts to taking advantage of people on the downside of an economic cycle," laments Roger Phillips, president if Ipsco Inc., a $500 million a year company that makes tubular steel in Regina, Saskatchewan, and Calgary, Alberta.
Backed by Ottawa, the Canadian companies have opened negotiations with their American counterparts on a potential peace formula -- a pact that would reflect the integrated nature of the steel market and prohibit antidumping measures if imports are either priced to meet the competition or do not have a substantial market share.
In beer, the United States has accused Canada of lacking good faith in removing trade barriers against American beer and has threatened to retaliate to recover $80 million of lost business. Washington has cited what it calls discriminatory practices by Ontario and Quebec. Particular anger has been voiced against an Ontario tax of 10 cents on all cans of beer sold in the province. Most of the American beer is sold in cans.
And Canada's apparel industry says it is fighting for its life in the Mexico-Canada-United States talks because of American demands for restrictive North American content rules. To placate the powerful American textile industry, Washington is insisting that clothing be cut and sewn in North America from fabric and yarn made on this continent before it can be traded duty-free among the three countries.
Yet virtually all the fabric in the Canadian dress and sportswear industry is imported from outside North America. "We search the world for great sources of supply, and we sell the niches; we're masters of nichemanship," says Jack Kivenko, vice president of Jack Spratt Manufacturing Inc. a jeans and workwear producer in Montreal and president of the Canadian Apparel Manufacturers Institute, a trade group.
If the American demand is accepted, he said, "it will mean that Canadian manufacturers will have to close down and locate manufacturing outside of Canada." The Canadian apparel industry employs about 125,000 people, 60 percent of whom work in the province of Quebec. The Politics Trade Issue Could Dominate
If the treaty does come up for ratification next year, the timing could not be worse for Mr. Mulroney, who may find free trade dominating the general elections. Although he has come up a little in the polls, a negative popular attitude toward the treaty is not what he needs. Only a few months ago his was the least popular administration since poll-taking started a half-century ago.
The Mulroney Government must call elections at least by the fall of 1993, and many expect the call next spring. But that is just when the North American agreement would be headed for final ratification by Congress and the two Parliaments.
Even if the Canadian Government tries to ignore the matter or play it down, the treaty's opponents do not plan to let that happen.
Lloyd Axworthy, a Liberal Member of Parliament from Winnipeg, Manitoba, and a leader of the opposition to free trade in 1988, said, "We will be much better prepared this time."
The Conservatives then won 169 of the 295 seats in the House of Commons, but they did so with less than half the votes cast -- 43 percent out of 13.1 million. Under Canada's plurality system, a candidate need poll only one vote more than the runner-up to win a seat, no matter how many votes the other candidates amass. The fact that the Liberal and New Democrat parties, both of which oppose free trade, were able to pick up 53 percent combined is cited by free-trade opponents as a justification for continuing their struggle.
Maude Barlow, an adviser on women's issues during the early 1980's Liberal leadership of Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, heads the Ottawa-based Council of Canadians, the chief lobby against free trade. She said her group would begin a campaign this fall to abrogate the 1989 pact "with brochures, buttons, cross-country tours, town hall meetings, the works" and is "forming alliances with like-minded organizations in the United States and Mexico, to bring our experiences to bear."
The free-trade opponents include a powerful coalition of labor and farm interests and social activists, who cite not only high joblessness (the latest unemployment rate was 11.6 percent of the labor force) but also what they see as greater American economic leverage over Canada and a resulting diminution of sovereignty.
Government officials insist that free trade is getting a bum rap.
"It's time to blow the whistle on the free- trade blame game," said Michael Wilson, Canada's International Trade Minister. "Despite the problems generated by a tough global recession, a spate of difficult disputes with the United States and a deep slide in public support for the free trade agreement in Canada, there is now clear evidence that the free trade agreement is working."
In addition to the University of Toronto, the O.E.C.D. and the International Monetary Fund studies, the Government points to a recent survey by a consulting firm, DRI Canada, that found 97 Canadian manufacturing industries gained or maintained their American market share in the last three years, while only 11 lost market share.
Also underscoring the gains from the pact, the Government statistics that show manufacturing output per person rising four-tenths of 1 percent in 1991 represent an exceptional gain for a recession year, economists say.
Every $1 billion of new Canadian exports translates into roughly 15,000 new jobs. Canada's exports rose to $103.4 billion in 1991, a 5 percent increase over 1989, according to Statistics Canada, still another sign that the pact may be working in Canada's favor.
Over the same period, Canada's trade surplus with the United States increased from $10.6 billion to $17.2 billion, which is about a third the level of Japan's.
In Mexico, Canada sees openings chiefly for exports of financial services and high-technology electronics and telecommunications. Some 200 Canadian companies showed up at a trade fair earlier this year at Monterrey, Mexico, and, according to the Canadian Trade Ministry, are filling their order books.
These companies represent the new competitive edge that Canada is getting in international trade. They have become so aggressive, said Mr. Wilson, the trade minister, that "they are not even waiting for the trade agreement."

Abstract: Martin Feldstein, president of the National Bureau of Economic Research, says in his introduction to "The Risk of Economic Crisis," a book based on a conference of leading American economists: "Although the United States has been fortunate enough not to experience the kind of massive economic collapse that occurred from time to time until the worldwide depression of the 1930's, there is no doubt that the possibility of another such financial and economic crisis cannot be dismissed." Could it happen now? Like Mr. Feldstein, Mr. [Hyman P. Minsky] says it could. Through nearly all of the postwar period, the United States had "fiscal autonomy" -- the power to take policy actions without much concern about adverse foreign reactions to the widening deficits that sustained domestic profits. "The situation may be different now," he warns. "The United States no longer is as autonomous or as powerful as in the past. Scenarios in which cooperation in maintaining global asset values and profit flows is necessary but not forthcoming can be sketched." Foreigners now have enormous holdings of American financial assets. The big deficits the United States ran in relatively prosperous times would mean the deficit it would have to run to abort a financial crisis might be enormous. The interventions next time, Mr. Minsky says, "may well be beyond the combined efforts of the Federal Reserve and the Treasury." Containing a future financial and economic crisis, he says, "may depend more on what Japan and Europe do than upon the Fed and the U.S. Treasury."

Full text: WHAT was at first regarded by the Bush Administration and the Federal Reserve as a mild and brief recession has become a long and painful one, possibly even what some economists are calling a "quiet depression."
David M. Jones, chief economist of Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, says this slump is distinguished from its postwar predecessors by a clash between a dangerously overleveraged economy and unusually severe bank loan stringency. "The threat posed is an all-out private-sector credit contraction and asset price deflation, accompanied by mounting corporate bankruptcies and bank failures," he said. "The resulting decline in consumer wealth could curtail spending for a prolonged period."
Is 1992 shaping up as the analogue of 1932, the year when the recession of 1930-31 collapsed into depression? Or do we know enough economics to stop that from ever happening again?
Martin Feldstein, president of the National Bureau of Economic Research, says in his introduction to "The Risk of Economic Crisis," a book based on a conference of leading American economists: "Although the United States has been fortunate enough not to experience the kind of massive economic collapse that occurred from time to time until the worldwide depression of the 1930's, there is no doubt that the possibility of another such financial and economic crisis cannot be dismissed."
In that book, Hyman P. Minsky, professor of economics at Washington University, concludes that the reason a vicious downward spiral has not yet led to depression in postwar America is that apt intervention by the Government and the central bank can abort the process leading to depression at two points. One comes when endangered financial institutions are at the point of selling off assets; the institutions can be refinanced to prevent a wave of sales and a sharp and general fall of asset prices. Refinancing banks and crucial financial players, he says, is the basic central bank lender-of-last-resort operation.
The other intervention point comes when profits start falling, and the Government can act to avert collapse. In the model Mr. Minsky uses, total profits equal investment plus the Government deficit. To sustain profits during a period of falling investment, the Government can run a larger deficit.
Why did the United States Government not do that after the crash of 1929? Mr. Minsky's answer is that the Federal Government then made up only 3 percent of gross national product -- too small to offset the impact that falling investment between 1929 and 1933 had upon corporate profits.
Today's Government, constituting some 25 percent of G.N.P., is large enough to sustain profits by increasing the deficit through automatic stabilizers or fiscal policy. The combination of lender-of-last-resort interventions and increasing Federal deficits, he says, "explains why a serious, long-lasting and deep depression has not taken place up until now."
But could it happen now? Like Mr. Feldstein, Mr. Minsky says it could. Through nearly all of the postwar period, the United States had "fiscal autonomy" -- the power to take policy actions without much concern about adverse foreign reactions to the widening deficits that sustained domestic profits. "The situation may be different now," he warns. "The United States no longer is as autonomous or as powerful as in the past. Scenarios in which cooperation in maintaining global asset values and profit flows is necessary but not forthcoming can be sketched."
Foreigners now have enormous holdings of American financial assets. The big deficits the United States ran in relatively prosperous times would mean the deficit it would have to run to abort a financial crisis might be enormous. The interventions next time, Mr. Minsky says, "may well be beyond the combined efforts of the Federal Reserve and the Treasury." Containing a future financial and economic crisis, he says, "may depend more on what Japan and Europe do than upon the Fed and the U.S. Treasury."
But, just when cooperation among the United States, Japan and Europe is more critical than ever, tensions among them are rising. The Uruguay Round of trade talks is in jeopardy. Germany and the United States are moving in opposite directions on monetary policy, with Germany following a tight-money, anti-inflation policy.
The Fed, with the year nearly over, moved to cut the discount rate by a full percentage point. And the Administration, at last publicly acknowledging that the recession was continuing, intensified its search for fiscal stimuli.
Both the Fed and the White House were driven by news of plant closings by General Motors and others, layoffs, the troubles of financial institutions, weak Christmas sales and the approaching cold dawn of the 1992 election year.
Thus, the United States is moving to head off a not-so-quiet depression, despite the big deficit and foreign constraints, and 1992 will prove whether the anti-depression economic medicine can work in an economy that has gone global. With its year-end surge, the stock market was betting that it would.

Abstract: The first is an updated version of the price index used to correct G.N.P. for inflation, shifting the base year of the index to 1987 from 1982. Periodic updates of the "G.N.P. deflator" are necessary as inflation or deflation affects different goods differently over the years, and the mix of goods that make up total national output changes. A price deflator based on outdated weights for different goods and services would distort the calculation. Using the new 1987-base G.N.P. deflator, the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis finds in a preliminary study that instead of falling at an annual rate of five-tenths of 1 percent in the second quarter, as measured in constant 1982 dollars, real G.N.P. rose by four-tenths of 1 percent, when measured in 1987 dollars. Thus, G.D.P. measures the value of goods and services produced within the United States, while G.N.P. includes the profits or other income received by Americans overseas. Production by, say, Toyota or Siemens in plants in the United States is included in America's G.D.P., but I.B.M.'s or General Motors' earnings brought back from Japan or Germany do not count in United States G.D.P. although they do count in G.N.P.

Full text: IS the American economy in a recovery, a recession or a no man's land? The answer is not easy to come by because economic statistics lag behind current events and because data on past growth or contraction are complex, crude and continually being revised.
For instance, the first estimate by the Commerce Department of real gross national product -- total output adjusted for inflation -- for the second quarter had the economy growing at an annual rate of four-tenths of 1 percent. Hats went off to hail the recovery. The second estimate moved that figure down to one-tenth of 1 percent, and some economists, including Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve Board's chairman, said the recession was over but the recovery had not yet begun.
Then department's third revision put the growth rate of real G.N.P. down further, to minus five-tenths of 1 percent in the second quarter, provoking worries that the economy was still in recession.
But that is not the end of the changing picture. Two new sets of data, to be released in late November, will indicate that the recovery did begin in the second quarter after all.
The first is an updated version of the price index used to correct G.N.P. for inflation, shifting the base year of the index to 1987 from 1982. Periodic updates of the "G.N.P. deflator" are necessary as inflation or deflation affects different goods differently over the years, and the mix of goods that make up total national output changes. A price deflator based on outdated weights for different goods and services would distort the calculation.
Using the new 1987-base G.N.P. deflator, the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis finds in a preliminary study that instead of falling at an annual rate of five-tenths of 1 percent in the second quarter, as measured in constant 1982 dollars, real G.N.P. rose by four-tenths of 1 percent, when measured in 1987 dollars.
When the department releases its first estimate of the just-completed third quarter on Oct. 29, real G.N.P. will still be measured on the old 1982 price base. The new figures for real G.N.P. on the 1987 price base will not be released until Nov. 26.
In addition to shifting from 1982 to 1987 dollars, the department's second change will be to emphasize gross domestic product, rather than gross national product, as the primary measure of the national economy. G.D.P. is already used by almost all countries as the main indicator of growth.
G.D.P. covers the goods and services "produced by labor and property located in the United States," while G.N.P. measures the market value of goods and services produced by property and labor "supplied by United States residents," whether the production is here or abroad.
Thus, G.D.P. measures the value of goods and services produced within the United States, while G.N.P. includes the profits or other income received by Americans overseas. Production by, say, Toyota or Siemens in plants in the United States is included in America's G.D.P., but I.B.M.'s or General Motors' earnings brought back from Japan or Germany do not count in United States G.D.P. although they do count in G.N.P.
G.D.P. is considered by the Commerce Department the better measure of what is happening within the American economy, since income flows to businesses or residents of this country from abroad are influenced mainly by economic developments in the rest of the world. No measure gives all one wants to know; the Commerce Department will continue to report on both G.D.P. and G.N.P.
Though new official data for G.D.P. will not be introduced until late November, preliminary estimates by the Commerce Department show that real G.D.P., measured in constant 1982 dollars, rose at an annual rate of 1.4 percent in the second quarter of 1991, even more than the revised figures for G.N.P. in 1987 dollars now indicate.
The evidence is that the recovery is in motion, but slow motion. An Experimental Index of Coincident Indicators, developed by the leading mapper of the business cycle, the National Burerau of Economic Research, points to continuing but slowing economic growth. This slowdown in the rise of the so-called X.C.I., the bureau says, reflects the modest growth in industrial production and the net declines in real personal income and employee-hours of work during July and August. The figures released yesterday by the Government on industrial production, capacity use, trade and inflation confirm this picture of a weakening recovery.
The economy is shaping up as the key election issue. This week President Bush narrowly defeated Democrats' efforts to override his veto of the bill to extend unemployment benefits, but called a meeting of Republican leaders to discuss tax cuts and other measures to spur the economy.

Full text: Special to The New York Times
The controversy over Israel's request for $10 billion in United States loan guarantees has focused wide attention on a large-scale but little-understood American aid effort that since 1967 has totaled at least $77 billion -- $16,500 for each Israeli citizen -- when adjusted for inflation.
American aid to Israel may actually be larger than that, since it consists not only of the well-known grants and loans that prop up the Israeli economy and bolster its military, but also seldom-noticed indirect assistance. This includes such items as huge transfers of surplus military equipment, subsidies for Israel's foreign aid program and assistance to refugees arriving from the Soviet Union, State Department and Congressional officials say.
Moreover, Israel alone among recipients of American aid receives its money at the beginning of each fiscal year, instead of in payments over the course of the year, allowing it to invest in United States Treasury securities and collect interest on the money until it is actually spent.
Nearly three-quarters of Israel's aid consists of grants, according to figures from the Bank of Israel. Israel reduced its annual interest on the remaining $13 billion in loans by $150 million several years ago by refinancing at a lower interest rate, a privilege also made available then to 37 other American allies with weak economies. No Need for U.S. to Pay
Israel is seeking the $10 billion in loan guarantees now to help resettle up to a million Jewish emigres expected by 1995. With the loan guarantees, banks would lend to Israel at reduced interest rates with the assurance that the United States would be responsible for any principal or interest payments that Israel could not make. Israel's credit rating is fairly good, and its officials say there would be no need for the United States to pay any money.
Israeli officials contend that without the guarantees their country would be unable to provide the housing and jobs needed to use fully the many skills of immigrants from the Soviet Union. The Israeli economy and imports from the United States would suffer, they contend.
But President Bush has insisted that granting the aid now would needlessly upset the Middle East peace process, and he has asked Congress to put off debate on the matter for four months.
The current political uproar has strengthened Congress's interest in examining the financial burden of the American relationship with Israel, which has not been well understood because Israel has tapped many sources outside the main foreign aid programs. List From State Department
Representative Lee H. Hamilton, the Indiana Democrat who heads the House Subcommittee on Europe and the Middle East, said he had recently received a list of readily measured aid from the State Department totaling $4 billion for the fiscal year ending this month. The list separately included several programs with costs that are hard to estimate, partly because not all of the money in them had been spent, he said.
"So far as I know it's a comprehensive list, but things keep popping out," Mr. Hamilton said.
An Administration official who insisted on anonymity said "it's really an aid industry," in which no one keeps a full tally of the aid provided.
Mr. Hamilton, Congressional aides and Israeli officials stressed that the United States received much in return for its assistance. Israel has been the nation's main military partner for decades in a region both vital to United States interests and highly unstable.
The $300 million for the stockpiling of American military equipment in Israel, for example, could not be labeled solely as aid to that country, since it is very advantageous to the United States to be able to store its gear there, Mr. Hamilton said.
Economic and military aid programs to Israel, without adjustment for inflation, totaled $47.8 billion from 1967 through last year, according to the figures from the Bank of Israel. But Israeli officials themselves pointed out that it would be more accurate to adjust for inflation. Using the consumer price index in the United States, the aid to Israel would be to $77 billion in 1991 dollars. Some Hard to Estimate
The programs that are hard to estimate include up to $700 million in surplus military equipment, most of it from American forces being withdrawn from Europe, that is to be turned over to Israel; $400 million in loan guarantees; $150 million in annual interest savings from the refinancing of United States military loans five years ago; $300 million for eventual stockpiles of American equipment in Israel; $60 million in price reductions for military equipment sales and $42 million for a joint air defense development program.
Israel's request for $10 billion in loan guarantees would not involve any immediate outlay for the United States. But under a new law that takes effect on Oct. 1, Congress would have to set aside some money to reflect the risk of potential defaults.
Congress's current budget rules also impose a cap on international spending, including foreign aid. Depending on how different types of aid are categorized, this means that Congress could be confronted with a difficult choice this year on how to divide up limited money among Israel, the Soviet Union and other candidates for American assistance.
The proposed $10 billion in loan guarantees for the resettlement of Soviet Jews in Israel would be much more generous than Mr. Bush's $1.5 billion agricultural loan guarantee program to feed the Soviet Union. The food loan program only guarantees 98 percent of the principal and the first 4.5 percentage points of interest. Banks Are Reluctant
Commercial banks have been reluctant to take part in this program for fear of losing the unguaranteed part of any loans.
By contrast, Israeli officials want their guarantees to cover all of the loans' principal and all of the interest. Because existing American loan guarantee programs do not have such generous terms, a new program would probably have to be created for Israel, Congressional aides said.
American loan guarantees could save Israel as much as $200 million a year in interest payments, said John F. H. Purcell, the director of the sovereign research group at Salomon Brothers Inc. This is because Israel has a BBB credit rating, forcing it to borrow at an interest rate that is 2 percentage points higher than the rate for United States Government-guaranteed debt, he said.
Such a calculation assumes that Israel would be able to borrow the money at all without the guarantees and without lowering its credit rating, which would result in higher interest rates. "Anybody but the very large countries would have trouble borrowing $10 billion," Mr. Purcell agreed.
Israeli officials estimate that with the guarantees they could borrow as much as $2 billion a year for five years, while without them they would be limited to $500 million a year.

Abstract: In describing his overall strategy, Mr. [Nicholas F. Brady] said, "When I first raised it last April, I was cast as a Johnny one-note." The "one note" heard by his critics in the United States and abroad was his call for lower interest rates. Foreign governments and publications said the United States had shown itself to be, as The Economist put it, "incapable of wise leaderhip." Many blamed Mr. Brady for trying to force monetary expansion at the risk of reigniting inflation. "The banking system is less strong," he said. "Are certain banks in trouble? Of course. Bigger banks? Yes!" But the mistakes of the 1980's, he said, should not deter us from moving ahead, "so that we're creating jobs, increasing investment." Affirming that "a strategy of hope is important," Mr. Brady drew a comparison with what he is proposing for the world economy and with the policy taken vis-a-vis Mexico, which, he said, is moving ahead economically "by marrying the Brady Plan for reducing Mexico's foreign debt with President Salinas's progress in opening up markets."

Full text: IN an interview on Wednesday, the Treasury Secretary, Nicholas F. Brady, said that at the London economic summit conference of the seven major industrial countries later this month, the United States would press for a "three-pronged strategy" to lift the world economy out of stagnation and help rescue the economies of the fledgling democracies of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.
At the end of the meeting of the rich industrial countries, Mikhail S. Gorbachev will arrive for talks on reconstruction, trade and aid, first with President Bush and then with the other Western leaders.
These are three elements in the United States strategy for the meeting that Mr. Brady described:
* A more dynamic monetary policy aimed at bringing down real interest rates -- what money really costs borrowers after allowing for inflation -- to stimulate economic growth and yield more employment, income and a higher rate of capital formation for a world desperately short of capital.
* An international trade policy focused on the successful completion of the current round of negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The talks are aimed at opening markets in all countries and breaking down regional barriers to the flow of goods, including agricultural products and textiles, as well as services and intellectual property.
* The elimination of structural rigidities hampering job creation and productivity growth within countries, whether capitalist, socialist or still struggling in the transition from Communism to a market economy.
In describing his overall strategy, Mr. Brady said, "When I first raised it last April, I was cast as a Johnny one-note." The "one note" heard by his critics in the United States and abroad was his call for lower interest rates. Foreign governments and publications said the United States had shown itself to be, as The Economist put it, "incapable of wise leaderhip." Many blamed Mr. Brady for trying to force monetary expansion at the risk of reigniting inflation.
Now Mr. Brady is seeking to put his quest for lower interest rates in a broader context and to reply to the charge that he is soft on inflation. "The economists always insist that we must have non-inflationary growth," he said, while he prefers to talk in terms of low-inflationary growth.
Mr. Brady is doubtful, as was the late Prof. Sumner Slichter of Harvard in the early post-World War II period, that zero inflation and vigorous growth are compatible. Like Professor Slichter's position, Mr. Brady's is regarded by many conservatives as not just heretical but, far worse, undeliverable and unstable. The acceptance of even low inflation is likely to lead to a much higher rate of inflation, the critics say.
In the 1950's and early 1960's, however, low inflation -- by Professor Slichter's definition, 2 percent a year -- did prove consistent with strong economic growth in the United States. In the 15 years from 1950 through 1964, real economic growth in the United States averaged 4 percent a year. With the escalation of the Vietnam War in the mid-1960's and the failure of the Johnson Administration to cut domestic spending or raise taxes to pay for the war and the Great Society, the compatibility of low inflation with high growth was shattered.
Mr. Brady believes that the world's economic leaders need greater confidence and should concentrate on positive goals, like growth and open world trade, rather than being hamstrung by negatives like fear of inflation and unemployment.
He did not try to defend all the policies that had produced economic growth and financial boom in the 1980's. On the contrary, he was highly critical of the wave of leveraged buyouts of corporations in the United States and excessive debt creation.
"The banking system is less strong," he said. "Are certain banks in trouble? Of course. Bigger banks? Yes!" But the mistakes of the 1980's, he said, should not deter us from moving ahead, "so that we're creating jobs, increasing investment."
Affirming that "a strategy of hope is important," Mr. Brady drew a comparison with what he is proposing for the world economy and with the policy taken vis-a-vis Mexico, which, he said, is moving ahead economically "by marrying the Brady Plan for reducing Mexico's foreign debt with President Salinas's progress in opening up markets."
He said that in convincing Mexicans, including expatriates as well as foreigners, that Mexico meant business and that debt reduction would work, what critics regarded as the missing element in the formulation of the plan -- money -- was flowing into the country. Mr. Brady said the inflow to Mexico of expatriate capital would rise this year to $14 billion from $4 billion last year.
Mr. Brady said he believed other governments were "getting the message" that he has been trying to deliver for a comprehensive growth-oriented strategy, including reductions in interest rates. He called attention to the Bank of Japan's half-point cut in its discount rate, its benchmark rate of interest, to 5.5 percent on Monday. Japan had been holding interest rates high to wring inflation out of the economy.
Mr. Brady said he also saw evidence that Britain, Italy, Spain and Denmark were moving to lower-rate policies. He was more equivocal about Germany, where Karl-Otto Pohl has resigned as head of the Bundesbank to be replaced by another monetary hard-liner, Helmut Schlesinger. Timothy Deal, a member of the National Security Council who is helping to prepare the United States position for the London summit meeting, said he thought the Germans were still adamant about their rate policies.
Mr. Brady's line on the urgency of growth appears to be gaining international support. This week, the United Nations World Economic Survey for 1991 predicted that global economic growth this year would be zero and would rise in 1992 to only 2 percent -- barely enough to keep pace with population growth. And the U.N. declared: "In various industrialized countries, the monetary authorities feel that output growth over 2 or 3 percent a year would be inflationary and must be restrained. As long as this view prevails, these nations cannot serve their historic role as an engine of world economic growth."
The survey concluded that the present mix of monetary and fiscal policy seems to express political priorities in which unemployment is an acceptable price for containing inflation, "and high real interest rates are welcomed even at the expense of growth, at least in the short term." If such policies continue, the report said, "the more dynamic international economic environment needed for a shorter adjustment in the developing countries and a less costly transition in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union will not materialize."
This will be not only the United Nations' but the United States' line at the summit meeting in London. Mr. Brady said that as he saw it, a strategy for regenerating growth is the most important item on the summit's agenda.
Photograph Part of the United States strategy at the London economic summit meeting will be to call for lower interest rates, according to the Treasury Secretary, Nicholas F. Brady. (Paul Hosefros/The New York Times)

Abstract: Mr. [Jacques Delors] seeks to blame the United States for this. He said he had told President Bush that if the United States continued its "negative" approach, in an attempt to paint the European Community as "the bad guy of the world," the talks would fail. "Bush understands that," Mr. Delors said. "We cannot negotiate under these circumstances." The Bush Administration regards this as evasion. It denies that it has taken an antagonistic line toward Europe on trade. The United States trade representative, Carla A. Hills, "has said nothing mean," said her spokesman, Timothy O'Leary. He said Mr. Delors was "trying to divert attention from the real issue -- outrageously high European agricultural subsidies." Do the American negotiators see any sign that the Europeans are willing to change their position? "There's nothing yet," Mr. O'Leary said. And what about the future? "It will depend on the mood," he said.

Full text: IS the world economy headed for a split into three warring trade blocs -- Europe, North America and East Asia?
"Not if we succeed in the Uruguay Round," said Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, during a discussion in New York this week. Named for the country where the current trade negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade began in 1986, the Uruguay Round broke down in December over Europe's refusal to yield to American demands for drastic cuts in farm subsidies.
Efforts to get the trade talks back on track are going on. But the most formidable obstacle to their success -- European resistance to lower subsidies -- has not been removed.
Mr. Delors seeks to blame the United States for this. He said he had told President Bush that if the United States continued its "negative" approach, in an attempt to paint the European Community as "the bad guy of the world," the talks would fail. "Bush understands that," Mr. Delors said. "We cannot negotiate under these circumstances."
The Bush Administration regards this as evasion. It denies that it has taken an antagonistic line toward Europe on trade. The United States trade representative, Carla A. Hills, "has said nothing mean," said her spokesman, Timothy O'Leary. He said Mr. Delors was "trying to divert attention from the real issue -- outrageously high European agricultural subsidies."
Do the American negotiators see any sign that the Europeans are willing to change their position? "There's nothing yet," Mr. O'Leary said. And what about the future? "It will depend on the mood," he said.
But Mr. Delors said he thought there was "a better mood" ahead for discussing agriculture. "I share the fears of many economists and politicians about a world divided into many blocs," he said.
This view represents a growing awareness that the United States is moving to establish its own regional trade bloc and is prepared to take unilateral action against countries that it deems to be discriminating against American exports.
Following the free-trade agreement with Canada, the Bush Administration is moving aggressively to negotiate a wide-ranging free-trade agreement with Mexico. The Administration faces opposition from labor and environmental groups but is being strongly supported by a coalition of business interests favoring the pact and supporting the Administration's request for "fast track" negotiating authority, which requires that trade agreements be voted up or down by Congress without amendment.
Two motions are now before Congress to end that fast-track authority. But President Bush intends to submit a plan to Congress within the next week to protect workers' rights and the environment to safeguard the Mexican agreement and fast-track bargaining authority. The Administration thinks it has too much at stake to let the Mexican agreement fail.
It believes that the deal is the key to stronger economic growth on both sides of the border. And if the Mexican deal goes through, the Administration means to negotiate a similar free-trade arrangement with Chile and later with other Latin American countries.
Skeptics wonder whether the effort to build an American regional bloc makes sense. Prof. Jagdish Bhagwati of Columbia University calls American regionalism "an empty threat" to the European Community.
In a forthcoming article in Foreign Affairs, he declares: "It is not credible that the United States would shoot itself in the foot, and indeed higher up, by sidetracking her energies and her trade to a region whose fragile democracies, inflations, debts and slow growth rates offer a far less attractive market than the burgeoning Far East and the European Community, both of which are even now more substantial markets for American exports. If the United States turns foolishly away from the world to her own backyard, the European Community's likely reaction would be: fine, get buried in it."
That may be an overstatement. There is full awareness, both here and abroad, how vital to the economic growth of every country expanding world trade has been, and what a threat to future growth would be posed by a splitting off of the United States, Europe and East Asia into hostile regional trading blocs.
If the Uruguay Round fails, the largest German bank, the Deutsche Bank, states in its Bulletin, "the current trend toward inward-looking trading blocs will probably accelerate, and trade conflicts will multiply."
No country wants that outcome, knowing that it could breed recession or depression. Regionalism, based on internal free-trade principles, can contribute to the welfare of the Americas, Europe and East Asia, but only if each region is open to other regions and nations.

Full text: Gold prices continued to climb yesterday as the resurgent oil market fanned inflation fears.
But platinum prices dropped sharply, reflecting declining Japanese investor interest and worldwide economic jitters.
Gold futures settled $2.30 to $2.40 higher on New York's Commodity Exchange, with the contract for spot delivery at $375.80 a troy ounce, up from $373.50 on Wednesday.
The increase marked gold's sixth daily advance in the last seven sessions, following a plunge to a three-month low of $360 on Oct. 16.
Silver futures settled 1.9 cents to 2 cents lower, with the spot price at $4.204 a troy ounce in lackluster trading on the Commodity Exchange.
Platinum was $6.60 to $8 lower on the New York Mercantile Exchange, with the spot price at $415.80 a troy ounce.
Analysts said demand for gold had increased as a result of lower prices for the metal and higher prices this week for crude oil, which has bounced back sharply amid intensifying Middle East war rhetoric.
"The war drums were beating today," said William O'Neill, a precious metals expert with Merrill Lynch.
Higher oil prices could portend higher inflation, which typically spurs investor demand for gold.
Higher oil prices also could tip industrialized nations into recession and reduce industrial demand for platinum, which is widely used in automobile pollution-control systems.
James Steel, an oil and metals analyst with Refco Inc., a commodities brokerage, said platinum was also under pressure from lower Japanese stock prices. The Japanese value platinum as an investment and jewelry metal.
In petroleum trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, light, sweet crude oil settled $2 to $3.17 higher, with December at $34.25 a barrel.
Grain and soybean futures prices fell modestly in light trading on the Chicago Board of Trade, reflecting slack export demand and harvest pressure.
Speculation about possible Soviet purchases of United States corn cooled amid reports from Moscow indicating the Soviets might not make any more purchases to fulfill a one-million-ton corn agreement by the end of the year without United States credit.

Abstract: I am puzzled by Irving Kristol's arithmetic in ''There Is No Military Free Lunch'' (Op-Ed, Feb. 2). He states that fixing the United States military budget at its current level would mean that, in 10 years, its buying power would be about 33 percent less than now - a fair projection, given the rate of inflation. Mr. Kristol states that the United States military establishment will then ''probably be slightly superior to Japan's, though perhaps not quite a match for Syria's tanks and air power.''

To the Editor:
I am puzzled by Irving Kristol's arithmetic in ''There Is No Military Free Lunch'' (Op-Ed, Feb. 2). He states that fixing the United States military budget at its current level would mean that, in 10 years, its buying power would be about 33 percent less than now - a fair projection, given the rate of inflation.
But Mr. Kristol states that the United States military establishment will then ''probably be slightly superior to Japan's, though perhaps not quite a match for Syria's tanks and air power.''
Now Japan spends about 1 percent of gross national product on defense, the United States more than 6 percent. Our G.N.P. is almost double Japan's; hence, we must be spending 10 to 12 times as much. Even if United States expenditures decline one-third in constant dollars, as Mr. Kristol projects, they would be seven to eight times current Japanese expenditures. Slightly superior? Is the real problem how much the United States spends on the military or how efficiently it uses the funds?
The comparison with Syria is even more ludicrous. The Syrian military is inferior to that of Israel, a country whose gross national product is a tiny fraction of the American and which must also contend with the Palestinian uprising and with threats on its Lebanese border.
Such scare projections, designed to protect the military budget at the expense of other needed programs, deflect from a reasoned consideration of just how much defense spending can be cut in the new international situation.

Francis Schott Chief economist, Equitable Life Assurance Society. The pickup in inflation in October's numbers isn't that significant. I fully expect that the next consumer price index will show a substantially slower rate of inflation. If you average the numbers, you can't conclude that inflation is accelerating. However, October retail sales are down 1.5 percentage points, the sharpest decline in two years, and personal consumption expenditures will be down for October as well. Throughout the year it has been difficult to achieve sales gains in durable and non-durable goods without price discounting. This indicates less inflation and slower growth.

The underlying inflation pressure - because of wage and cost problems - is still upward. Nevertheless, the 1990 inflation rate will be 4.5 percent, the same as in 1989.
The Fed would like to assist the economy, which is slowing, yet it has to continue fighting inflation, which at 4.5 percent is still too high. The solution to the dilemma is a very gradual easing of interest rates which will continue to 1990.
The Fed funds rate will come down another quarter percentage point to 8.25 by year-end. The prime rate will be down to at least 10 percent by year-end. During the first half of next year, the Fed funds will be 7.5 and the prime will be 9.5 or even lower. Pat Choate Economist and vice president, policy analysis, TRW Inc.
The ability of the Fed to make dramatic cuts in interest rates is severely constrained. The Federal budget deficit swirls along and there is no prospect of shrinking it before 1991. This continues to give the economy a very massive Keynesian stimulus. In addition, the continuing demand for imports is bidding up import prices and the dramatic availability of credit won't help keep inflation low.
I think the Fed will stand pat on interest rates. The Fed wants to cut inflation to zero. They will keep rates where they are, and I think that's the right thing to do. Inflation is still very troubling for the economy. Leif Olsen President, Leif Olsen Associates, an economics consulting firm.
The pickup in inflation in October's numbers isn't that significant. I fully expect that the next consumer price index will show a substantially slower rate of inflation. If you average the numbers, you can't conclude that inflation is accelerating. However, October retail sales are down 1.5 percentage points, the sharpest decline in two years, and personal consumption expenditures will be down for October as well. Throughout the year it has been difficult to achieve sales gains in durable and non-durable goods without price discounting. This indicates less inflation and slower growth.
The Fed will ease the funds rate one-fourth percent between now and early December depending on how slow the employment gains are. If we get surprisingly slow employment gains, we could also get a discount rate reduction as well. The prime rate will move when the Fed moves. Lacy Hunt Chief economist, Carroll, McEntee & McGinley Inc.
The inflation rate appears to be heading above 5 percent, perhaps up to 5.5 percent for the next year. First of all, wages are accelerating and will be given a boost by the minimum wage law. Productivity growth remains poor, meaning that the wage increases will be passed on in higher prices. Unleashing 450 million consumers behind the Iron Curtain suggests that there will be upward pressure on food prices. One of the big offsets to inflation has been oil prices, but now it appears that oil prices are headed upward. Reinforcing this is the fact that gold has risen above $400 an ounce - a 10-month high - and other commodities are going up as well.
If there is going to be a further easing in interest rates by the Fed, it has to be now. The economy will be stronger in the first part of the year. This quarter's gross national product grew by 1.4 percent. But this quarter absorbed two major natural disasters and two long strikes. Long-term interest rates will be down by one percentage point next year while growth will be at a 3 percent or better rate.

Abstract: LEAD: Recent work at the Federal Reserve board, christened P-Star analysis, has stimulated a renewed debate about the relationship between the money supply and inflation. This new work is based on the earlier work of Irving Fisher, which he conducted evidence, and concluded that the P-Star concept is helpful in understanding inflation. If a concept is really helpful in understanding the workings of a capitalist economy, then it should be helpful when applied to any particular capitalist economy. To ascertain whether P-Star is equally useful outside of the United states, my colleagues and I examined the concept as a predictive tool in a number of different countries. We applied P-Star analysis to the United States, Britain, Japan and Australia. For each country, we found that the P-Star concept is useful in understanding the relationship between the money supply and inflation. It is our conclusion that P-Star is not foolproof. But neither is any other tool of economic analysis. Its results are sensitive to assumptions about economic growth, money velocity, and money growth, and it is most useful in judging the long-run forces influencing inflation. Having said that it is not perfect, however, it is also worth saying that the P-Star analysis is a useful addition to the tools that help us better understand the workings of the economy. In short, P-Star travels well.

Recent work at the Federal Reserve board, christened P-Star analysis, has stimulated a renewed debate about the relationship between the money supply and inflation. This new work is based on the earlier work of Irving Fisher, which he conducted evidence, and concluded that the P-Star concept is helpful in understanding inflation.
Members of the Federal Reserve and its staff have been very careful in describing the usefulness of the P-Star concept. This is not a short-term forecasting tool that will predict next month's consumer price index. Nor will it provide simple answers to the policy choices central bankers must make.
What P-Star will do is provide a reasonably useful guide to whether inflation should be expected to speed up or slow down over the next 6 to 12 months. It can serve as an indicator of inflation over this period of time, provided there are no shocks to the system, like a major oil price change, and provided the current trends continue with respect to growth and the velocity of money - the number of times each unit of money is used to purchase the nation's output of goods and services each year.
After reviewing the Federal Reserve's analysis and agreeing that it provides a useful approach to understanding the relationship between the money supply and inflation, one is left wondering how well P-Star will travel. Can it be applied to other countries?
If a concept is really helpful in understanding the workings of a capitalist economy, then it should be helpful when applied to any particular capitalist economy. To ascertain whether P-Star is equally useful outside of the United states, my colleagues and I examined the concept as a predictive tool in a number of different countries. We applied P-Star analysis to the United States, Britain, Japan and Australia. For each country, we found that the P-Star concept is useful in understanding the relationship between the money supply and inflation.
Applying empirical tests to any economic theory is always a tricky proposition, but this is even more true when the theory is tested for different countries.
Capitalism is the common denominator, but each economy has its own characteristics. Definitions of commonly used terms, like money supply, vary. Measurements are made differently and data are aggregated differently. In some cases, financial instruments in one country do not have an exact counterpart in another.
With this standard in mind, we have reached conclusions about the outlook for inflation in each of the countries we examined. What makes these conclusions so interesting is that in each case P-Star analysis confirms the results of our inflation analysis based on traditional methods using real growth, wage trends, capital costs, resource costs, and so on.
In the case of Japan, our economists have concluded that the P-Star analysis is useful, provided transitory shocks like the oil crisis and the recently imposed 3 percent consumption tax are excluded. This work suggests that inflation in Japan has probably peaked as these special factors boosting inflation work through the system.
For Britain, there appears to be an unusually long time lag between changes in the actual rate of inflation and changes in the expected rate of inflation. Our analysis suggests that the current policy that has resulted in 14 percent interest rates and a sharp slowdown in the growth of the money supply is not excessive. However, it will have to be maintained for some time before the inflation outlook improves.
In Australia, the leveling out in the growth of the money supply since the end of 1988 points to the likelihood that there will be a lower inflation rate for 1990 and 1991.
No matter which country is used for the P-Star analysis, however, a healthy dose of caution is appropriate. It is quite possible that the stock of money outstanding in the world is large enough to maintain inflation's current momentum. In other words, there is still a substantial amount of liquidity in the global economy that was accumulated during 1987 and 1988 and that could cause inflation problems. Central bankers must continue to be alert to this possibility as they develop their policies.
It is our conclusion that P-Star is not foolproof. But neither is any other tool of economic analysis. Its results are sensitive to assumptions about economic growth, money velocity, and money growth, and it is most useful in judging the long-run forces influencing inflation. Having said that it is not perfect, however, it is also worth saying that the P-Star analysis is a useful addition to the tools that help us better understand the workings of the economy. In short, P-Star travels well.

Abstract: Similarly, the Bush Administration started out by passively watching the dollar climb from 123 to 145 Japanese yen and from 1.7 to 1.95 against the German mark - until shortly before last week's Group of Seven meeting. Does that constitute a ''Plaza II'' commitment, in the phrase of C. Fred Bergsten of the Institute of International Economics? Or is it only a temporary convenience? The markets don't believe this is Plaza II. Shafiqul Islam, the senior fellow for international finance on the Council on Foreign Relations, said, ''The markets are confused - they see the United States only half-committed to stabilizing exchange rates, acting in a sense of crisis, but unsure what the real problem is.'' The European and Japanese governments also continue to doubt that the United States is yet prepared to take the hard, fundamental steps needed to restore strength to the dollar. Mr. Islam says, ''They are asking, 'If the United States doesn't fix its own policy, why should others support the U.S.?' '' Thus, the chronic United States budget deficits, low savings rates, and high costs of capital are forces that underlie what Budget Director Richard G. Darman calls ''now-now-ism,'' the fevered search of Americans for deals with immediate payoffs. Dollar depreciation may be the unavoidable consequence of fiscal deficits, payments deficits, high interest rates and a loss of national competitiveness, but cannot provide a lasting cure for those ills, as the poor experiences of other debt-ridden countries have amply demonstrated.

Full text: LEAD: THE Bush Administration, concerned about the rising dollar, appears to have ended its ''benign neglect'' for the time being and is working with other governments to push the currency down.
THE Bush Administration, concerned about the rising dollar, appears to have ended its ''benign neglect'' for the time being and is working with other governments to push the currency down.
Yesterday, help came from abroad when the Bundesbank, West Germany's central bank, raised its key discount and Lombard rates a full percentage point and sold a lot of dollars. Other European central banks followed and the dollar fell - but briefly, and then went up again. The foreign-exchange markets had expected the move and had already factored it in. The markets remain uncertain, however, over how committed the United States and its partners in the Group of Seven, most importantly West Germany and Japan, are to pushing the dollar down, and holding it down, against market forces that have been pushing it up.
The Bush Administration lacks credibility on its dollar policy. From the time it took office until just before last week's meetings in Washington of the International Monetary Fund and the Group of Seven, the Bush Administration had reverted to the benign neglect of the dollar followed by President Reagan's first Treasury Secretary, Donald T. Regan. In the second Reagan term, James A. Baker 3d moved to the Treasury and set the dollar on a downward course, fearful at last that the soaring dollar, once hailed as a mark of strength, was ruining the nation's trade position.
Similarly, the Bush Administration started out by passively watching the dollar climb from 123 to 145 Japanese yen and from 1.7 to 1.95 against the German mark - until shortly before last week's Group of Seven meeting. Does that constitute a ''Plaza II'' commitment, in the phrase of C. Fred Bergsten of the Institute of International Economics? Or is it only a temporary convenience?
If market forces - and psychology - continued to drive the dollar up, it could again undermine American exports, suck in a rising tide of imports, aggravate protectionist pressures and drag the United States into recession.
The White House, apart from its dollar anxieties, also wanted lower interest rates for domestic reasons, to ward off recession and spur economic growth, and had been leaning on the Fed to deliver lower rates. The Germans, for their part, were worried that a rising dollar - and falling mark -would intensify inflationary pressures in their country and throughout Europe. But the Japanese are not yet ready to go along.
And the markets don't believe this is Plaza II. Shafiqul Islam, the senior fellow for international finance on the Council on Foreign Relations, said, ''The markets are confused - they see the United States only half-committed to stabilizing exchange rates, acting in a sense of crisis, but unsure what the real problem is.'' The European and Japanese governments also continue to doubt that the United States is yet prepared to take the hard, fundamental steps needed to restore strength to the dollar. Mr. Islam says, ''They are asking, 'If the United States doesn't fix its own policy, why should others support the U.S.?' ''
More important than rhetoric to talk the dollar down, central bank intervention or even coordinated manipulation of rates is whether the United States is prepared to deal with the budget deficit. It lies at the root of the trade deficit, the savings shortage, the dependence on foreign capital and the high interest rates that push the dollar up.
As Ronald McKinnon of Stanford University observes, in a highly open economy only fiscal policy, which operates directly on the balance between savings and investment, can reduce a deficit in trade and the balance of payments. In the 1980's, he says, the American fiscal deficit created a savings deficiency, which has not been repaired.
The now-widening United States budget deficit, partly disguised by putting the savings and loan bailout and other items ''off budget'' while putting the Social Security trust-fund surplus on budget, threatens to keep the American trade position weak and increases the ultimate risk of future dollar devaluation.
With that risk of devaluation - and the fear that it will result in higher inflation - investors demand higher yields on dollar assets than on those denominated in yen or marks. The high-risk premiums built into United States interest rates shorten the time horizons of American business.
Thus, the chronic United States budget deficits, low savings rates, and high costs of capital are forces that underlie what Budget Director Richard G. Darman calls ''now-now-ism,'' the fevered search of Americans for deals with immediate payoffs. Dollar depreciation may be the unavoidable consequence of fiscal deficits, payments deficits, high interest rates and a loss of national competitiveness, but cannot provide a lasting cure for those ills, as the poor experiences of other debt-ridden countries have amply demonstrated.

Japanese tariff rates are only 6.4 percent, even lower than those of the United States, Canada or the European Community. But even so,, gaining market access in Japan is an experience not unlike attaining justice in Franz Kafka's novel ''The Trial.''
To the charge of a closed market, Japanese officials use one of two responses. Either they assert that Japan is not closed at all - but that Japanese consumers are special. Or they argue that perhaps there were difficulties in the past, but all that has changed and Japan is opening up vigorously.
Neither is true. Industrialized countries, without exception, show major increases in import penetration over time. But in Japan the ratio of manufactured imports to gross national product has stayed at about 2 percent over the last 20 years.
Japanese officials are quick to claim that Japan has been making strides in market opening. They make much of the fact that manufactured goods already account for more than half of imports, far above the share in the 1970's. But the rising share of manufactured goods is only the mirror image of the fall in oil and commodity prices in the 1980's and not the result of a sharp rise in manufactured imports. Growth of two-way trade in manufactures - common elsewhere because consumers like variety - has not happened in Japan.
It does not really matter for our purposes what causes Japan's imports to be low. There is no question that import discrimination exists. But the resulting cost of protection on Japanese consumers is their own problem, not ours. Even so, their discrimination hurts our export companies and that is unacceptable in an open trading system.
A new American trade policy toward Japan is now required. Where negotiations at the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and diplomacy have failed, the Super 301 provision of the 1988 trade law offers a means to force recognition of American trade interests in the world market.
The Super 301 route should be used to increase American market penetration in Japan. A target should be set based on the growth rate of Japanese imports of American manufactured goods. Japan should be required to increase its imports of manufactured goods from the United States at an average rate of at least 15 percent per year, with adjustments for inflation in each country. Assuming a 5 percent growth rate in Japan, the import share of American manufactured goods in the Japanese market would thus rise from 0.7 percent to 1.7 percent over a 10-year period.
There ought to be an effective sanction mechanism, automatic and forceful enough to initiate a timely and complete Japanese understanding that adjustment is now required or else access to the American market will be blocked. A suitable mechanism is an automatic tariff surcharge on Japanese exports to the United States. The surcharge would be triggered automatically in proportion to any shortfall of the Japanese import growth target. Early fulfillment of the target would halt the process.
Such a policy raises a number of issues. Japan might simply shift demand from European to American goods. If so what would be the European response? And what if Europe made the same demands of Japan as the United States? One would hope that Europe would do just that and, in exchange, forgo the growing tendency to discriminate against Japanese goods. Japan would face a multilateral challenge to open its markets that, if met, would lead to freer trade.
Japanese companies might also locate in the United States to produce ''Japanese'' goods for sale in Japan and thus meet the import test. There is no problem with Japanese investment in the United States; we are interested in ''good jobs at good wages'' and American-located production. Whether the employer is an American or Japanese company is almost irrelevant. Of course, trade growth targets have to be based on exports of products with substantial American content.
Japan might consider this American posture unacceptable. The trade problem could then widen to become a national security concern and confrontation would be unavoidable. Japan has grown up and is looking to define a role commensurate with its economic strength. In that search, Japan must choose whether it is willing to be part of an open trading system or is seeking another role.
We are ambivalent about Japan, fearful of Japan bashing and uncertain about triggering trade conflict. Japan is conscious of our lack of resolve and exploits it to the fullest. Where we go wrong is in assuming that the showdown can be avoided. If we do not open up Japan's market, the next recession will inevitably lead to import restrictions here - a much worse outcome for the entire liberal trading system.

A Shaky Lid on an Inflation Threat

Abstract: Mr. [Robert Dryden] said Caterpillar had been able ''to insulate itself from the effect of the weaker dollar'' by constantly switching suppliers. The steel castings for cutting edges had been made by a Nebraska company, but the business went to a French concern, which, despite the strong franc, was willing to accept a price 20 percent lower than the Nebraska company's, Mr. Dryden said. ''There are Japanese and American competitors out there to discipline us,'' said Donald Paris, the company's chief economist. ''People haven't realized the determination of companies to hold on to customers. That's one of the reasons for the mistake about inflation.'' A price index covering the Dow Chemical Company's various products rose by 14 percent last year - an increase that plastics manufacturers that use Dow's chemicals could not always pass along to their customers. Paul Oreffice, Dow's chairman, said the increase simply restored Dow's price index to its early 1980's level.

Full text: LEAD: As the dollar has plunged in the last four years, economists and policy makers have worried that the steep devaluation would eventually fuel inflation in the United States.
As the dollar has plunged in the last four years, economists and policy makers have worried that the steep devaluation would eventually fuel inflation in the United States.
This would happen, they reasoned, because foreign businesses would eventually be forced to raise the dollar prices of the products they sell in this country. Only by collecting more dollars could foreign companies maintain their revenues and profits in yen or marks.
They have indeed raised prices - not as much as economists had predicted but by enough to have a potentially big impact on inflation in the United States. Since the dollar began its decline in March 1985, the producer or wholesale prices that foreign businesses charge their American customers for thousands of products - including cameras, cars, steel, clothing, wine, machinery and medical equipment - have risen by an average of 26.2 percent. Most of this large increase has occurred in the last two years, according to Government data.
But a puzzling fact is that many of those price increases have not yet been passed on to the final consumer. The contribution of these increases to the 4.4 percent rise in the Consumer Price Index last year was less - perhaps much less - than five-tenths of one percentage point, estimates Catherine L. Mann, an economist at the World Bank who has studied the exchange rate-inflation relationship. Many economists had expected the contribution to be at least five-tenths of a percentage point.
The Government does not calculate the impact of rising import prices on the C.P.I. But anecdotal evidence supports the contention that the impact has been mild.
''The pass-through is not minimal but has been less than historical trends would have suggested,'' said Nigel Gault, a senior economist at Data Resources Inc.
Whether the pass-through will continue to be modest, however, is anyone's guess. Some economists and business executives see signs that price increases for imported goods are beginning to accelerate, a development more likely to take root if the dollar falls more. If that happens, and if the economy remains strong, more of the price increases will be passed on to the final consumer, some economists and business executives warn.
But others believe that growing competition from such newly industrialized nations as South Korea and Thailand will constrain the ability of Japanese and European companies - and also American companies - to raise prices in the United States .
Increasing the likelihood that import prices will remain a relatively small factor in inflation is the fact that American companies have changed the way they buy materials, components and machinery from abroad. They are increasingly trying to persuade suppliers to hold down prices - by promising them long-term relationships, for example, or by pitting one supplier against another.
The hold-down in prices is not uniform, of course. Rising import prices are passed along quickly to consumers when the product involved is in great demand and nothing quite like it is made in the United States. The Japanese, for example, are virtually the only manufacturers of 35-millimeter cameras, and such cameras today cost 50 to 60 percent more in retail stores in the United States than they did in 1985.
The wholesale prices of European wines have risen by more than 25 percent since 1985. Zachy's, a big liquor store in Scarsdale, N.Y., for one, did not increase its prices for French wine substantially until last year, when it raised them by 15 to 20 percent. From 1985 through 1987, Zachy's had not raised them by more than 5 percent annually.
''We had inventories to sell from, and we wanted to be competitive with domestic wines,'' said Garnett Eisner, Zachy's manager. But he said that wholesale prices finally rose so much that he had no choice but to pass them through.
The more common experience, however, is that of Caterpillar Inc. Like so many American manufacturers, Caterpillar, based in Peoria, Ill., is a big buyer of parts, machinery and materials from abroad. These purchases constitute a huge portion of the country's total imports.
In Caterpillar's case, 20 percent of all the items that the company uses to manufacture earth movers, tractors and other heavy equipment are purchased from overseas suppliers. These include steel from Brazil, automated welders from Sweden, machine tools from West Germany and Japan, and French-made steel castings that are honed into cutting edges for the plows that go on Caterpillar's tractors and earth movers.
Some of the computer-controlled, multimillion-dollar machine tools brought from Europe and Japan for Caterpillar's Peoria factory simply are not available in the United States. Their prices have risen more than 30 percent since 1985, including a 10 percent increase in the last 18 months, said Robert Dryden, a purchasing vice president at Caterpillar.
But Mr. Dryden said Caterpillar had been able ''to insulate itself from the effect of the weaker dollar'' by constantly switching suppliers. The steel castings for cutting edges had been made by a Nebraska company, but the business went to a French concern, which, despite the strong franc, was willing to accept a price 20 percent lower than the Nebraska company's, Mr. Dryden said.
On the other hand, 70 percent of the starting motors for the big diesel engines in Caterpillar equipment had been German-made until recently. That business now goes to a supplier in the United States: the Delco Products unit of the General Motors Corporation. ''We are constantly looking for these opportunities,'' Mr. Dryden said.
Using this approach, Caterpillar was able to keep overall price increases for its foreign supplies last year to 10 percent, the same rate of increase for the supplies it purchased in the United States. The prices Caterpillar charges for its heavy equipment went up only 5 percent last year and barely at all in 1986 and 1987.
''There are Japanese and American competitors out there to discipline us,'' said Donald Paris, the company's chief economist. ''People haven't realized the determination of companies to hold on to customers. That's one of the reasons for the mistake about inflation.''
Executives at other manufacturers tell similar stories. Steven Roberts, a purchasing executive at the Ford Motor Company, said that besides shopping around, Ford also holds down costs by developing long-term relationships with suppliers and ''working with them on pricing.''
Such actions help to explain why import prices have not climbed nearly as much as foreign currencies have against the dollar.
A weighted basket of the currencies of the nations from which the United States receives most of its imports has appreciated nearly 50 percent against the dollar since March 1985. Many economists had expected that appreciation to cause import prices to jump by 35 to 40 percent - or about 10 percentage points more than they have.
Ms. Mann of the World Bank says much more work needs to be done to understand the relationships among currency fluctuations, import prices and inflation rates. ''No one has tried to show just how changes in import product prices ultimately show up in the inflation rate,'' she said.
The research suggested by Ms. Mann would have to deal with the wealth of anecdotal evidence not accounted for in economic theory.
Dollar devaluation, for example, has served as a ''shield'' that has protected price increases by American manufacturers of basic materials, such as chemicals.
A price index covering the Dow Chemical Company's various products rose by 14 percent last year - an increase that plastics manufacturers that use Dow's chemicals could not always pass along to their customers. Paul Oreffice, Dow's chairman, said the increase simply restored Dow's price index to its early 1980's level.
That may be, but the increase became possible because the weak dollar helped make Dow a low-cost producer worldwide. This, in turn, opened up export markets and prevented foreign manufacturers from underpricing Dow at home.
The auto industry operates behind a different sort of shield, one that is not as inflationary. The prices of American-made and imported cars have risen in lock step since 1985, as if one kept a leash on the other. The Commerce Department keeps track of actual show-room selling prices, adjusted for discounts, rebates and taxes, but excluding financing costs and trade-in allowances.
The data show that the average price of an imported car was $15,316 last year, up 24 percent over the last four years. Although American car makers could have held the line on prices and tried to grab sales from the imports, they raised prices, too. The price of American-made cars rose an average of 25 percent during the same period, to $14,010 in 1988. ''One could argue that the devaluation and the increases in foreign car prices gave the domestic people a chance to raise their prices,'' said Clinton McCully, a Commerce Department economist.
The impact of devaluation on prices is sometimes hard to distinguish from other factors. The price of American- and foreign-made sheet steel used in cars and appliances, for example, is now about $600 a ton in the United States, up more than 20 percent since 1985, with most of the increase occurring in the last two years. Voluntary restraint agreements limiting steel imports played a role by cutting foreign competition in the United States. Dollar devaluation also helped, by bringing American steel more into line with overseas costs.
But in the view of Harutame Umezawa, executive vice president of Nippon Steel U.S.A., the biggest factor in the price increase has been strong worldwide demand for steel, with barely enough factory capacity to fill all the orders. Nippon Steel ships one million tons of steel to the United States a year, and if import limits were lifted, Nippon might not be able to increase this amount by very much because of short supplies in Japan, Mr. Umezawa said.
For the past year, another sort of import barrier has had a very clear effect on the price of metal ball-bearings, used in thousands of products with moving parts. An anti-dumping action last year by the Federal Government helped to push up the price of foreign-made ball-bearings.
Behind this shield, American manufacturers have raised pricesby 11 percent in the past year, squeezing companies like Monarch Machine Tool in Sidney, Ohio, which makes factory lathes.
''Our margins are way, way down,'' said Robert J. Siewert, the company's chief executive. Because of stiff competition from foreign machinery manufacturers, Monarch has managed to increase the prices of its lathes by a total of only 5 percent over the past two years.
But Mr. Siewert sees the tide turning. His overseas competitors, he says, are finally pushing up the prices of their lathes, attempting to recover more of their currency-related losses. That, in turn, will allow Monarch to raise the amount it charges for its machines, although no increases are planned yet, Mr. Siewert said.

Full text: LEAD: Interest rates and the supposed trade-off between faster growth and higher inflation will be a problem for President Bush in 1989. His ''flexible freeze'' program to reduce the budget deficit requires lower interest rates - which reduce the cost of the existing deficit - and faster growth, which increases revenue.
Interest rates and the supposed trade-off between faster growth and higher inflation will be a problem for President Bush in 1989. His ''flexible freeze'' program to reduce the budget deficit requires lower interest rates - which reduce the cost of the existing deficit - and faster growth, which increases revenue. But the decision makers at the Federal Reserve Board fear that faster growth will cause inflation. As a result, the Fed has pushed up short-term interest rates more than two percentage points since March in an effort to slow the economy.
If the economy is to grow fast enough to reduce the budget deficit and provide resources for many other pressing needs, the new administration will have to seek lower interest rates and find other ways to fight inflation. Since 1969, the tight-money, slow-growth policies to control inflation have impeded the modernization of American manufacturing.
The contrast between Japanese and American economic policy is stark. The Japanese understand that faster growth means more investment in modern plants. This investment leads to lower production costs, increased competitiveness, higher living standards and - yes - less inflation. New plants are more efficient than old ones, therefore slowing growth inevitably means an economy that is less competitive.
Unfortunately, there is no sign that the United States is reconsidering its slow-growth economic course. This year, Japan is expected to grow 50 percent faster than America - the continuation of an 11-year trend. And gross fixed business investment, which is needed to provide for this growth, is 21 percent of gross national product in Japan, but only about 1.3 percent of G.N.P. in the United States. Slowing America's growth once more to fight inflation means that capital plants in this country will continue to fall behind those in Japan.
This is not to say that it is wrong to be concerned about inflation. With the current rate running at 4 to 5 percent, inflation is still a serious problem.
But high interest rates and slow growth reduce inflation in the way that chemotherapy works on cancer. It kills the good along with the bad cells and makes the patient dreadfully sick. Physicians, to their credit, are trying to find therapies that will kill cancer cells without killing the patient. But America's economic policy makers have not made the same intellectual leap.
America's domestic prices rose faster than Japanese prices from 1982 through 1986, when the opposite might have been expected. During that period, American prices were being held down first by recession and then by cheaper imports resulting from the strong dollar. Japanese domestic prices in the early 1980's should have surged. They were being pulled up by, among other things, a falling yen. But Japanese prices did not rise, and the reason for this gives a clue to what American anti-inflation policy should be.
Data suggest that the place to look for an explanation for Japan's success in controlling inflation is in the way its manufacturing industries control costs and price their products. Japan's producer price index rose 25 percent from 1976 to 1981. And the prices of important categories of manufactured goods like vehicles, electrical equipment and precision instruments, rose little or not at all. Those manufacturing industries avoided higher domestic and export prices when the rising cost of imported energy and raw materials might easily have pushed them up. They also avoided rising prices in the early 1980's when the rising dollar, with its impact on commodities, might also have pulled prices up. Japanese industrial prices have stayed down since 1985, although the rising yen has eaten into export price margins.
To keep prices stable, Japanese manufacturers are using productivity gains, which accrue when manufacturing industries invest, to expand and modernize.
In sharp contrast, since 1975, key American industries which compete with Japan have seen their own prices increase far faster than the producer price index. For example, Japanese wholesale auto prices are hardly higher now than in 1976. By contrast, American auto prices at the producer level, are up 12 percent since 1982 and 56 percent since 1978. And American steel prices surged 15 to 30 percent in the past two years, while Japan's prices remained stable.
The data show that falling industrial prices have kept Japan's overall inflation rate down, allowing for faster growth without inflation. Japanese manufacturers have raised productivity sharply by continuously modernizing their plants and consistently passing the gains on to domestic and foreign consumers. American manufacturing has had sharp productivity gains too, but key sectors have raised - not lowered - prices. As a result, American productivity increases have not meant greater market share, lower imports, higher employment, or faster growth.
What does this tell us about the inflationary bottlenecks in the American economy? It suggests that the place to look for the causes of inflation is in the pricing policies of key manufacturing industries. It is wrong to say that oil prices ''caused'' the inflation in this country in 1979 and 1980 since they had no comparable effect in Japan. Rather, the problem is in the reaction of American manufacturing industries, where productivity gains, which have largely offset higher raw materials prices, have not been passed through to domestic and foreign consumers.
In 1989, President Bush can have faster growth without inflation. But to have it he must use the Presidency to encourage American manufacturers to keep prices down to gain market share as the Japanese do. His administration needs to question damaging price increases publicly in the most important sectors of the economy. To do this will require a significant change in policy. There will be shouts of protest. But most American consumers will approve, and the data suggest that doing this is crucial.
If American manufacturing industries price their products less for quick profits and more to gain market share, the United States can beat inflation without slowing growth. Instead of letting the Federal Reserve fight inflation with the painful chemotherapy of tight money, the new administration ought to encourage anti-inflation pricing by industry. That is what our most successful competitor does.

Full text: LEAD: The futures prices of precious metals ended lower yesterday after a report on the nation's unemployment reduced fears of inflation.
The futures prices of precious metals ended lower yesterday after a report on the nation's unemployment reduced fears of inflation.
The Labor Department reported yesterday morning that the nation's unemployment rate had risen to 5.5 percent in August, from 5.4 percent in July. The report indicated that the economy would not grow as quickly as previously anticipated, reducing the worries over inflation and higher interest rates.
Metal futures initially plunged on the unemployment news, with platinum down nearly $19 an ounce at midday. But prices recovered late in the session to close only modestly lower.
Precious metals, commonly seen as an investment hedge against inflation, tend to rise and fall with inflationary expectations. A sharp drop in crude oil prices added to the bearish tone in the metals markets, analysts said.
Peter Cardillo, commodities trading adviser with Josephthal & Company in New York, said the metals markets remained technically weak despite the comeback.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, platinum settled $7.90 to $8.20 lower, with October at $523.50 an ounce. On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold settled 90 cents to $2.70 lower, with October at $431.80 an ounce; silver was 5.6 cents to 8 cents lower, with September at $6.518 an ounce.
Grain and soybean futures finished mostly higher on the Chicago Board of Trade in a late surge stimulated by technical factors in the absence of new supply-and-demand developments.
After the close, the Agriculture Department announced that the Soviet Union had bought an additional 800,000 metric tons of United States corn for delivery during the 1988-89 marketing year. The sale of 100,000 tons of corn was announced on Thursday, also for delivery in 1988-89.
Rumors of a large corn sale to the Soviets had lifted corn futures prices earlier in the week.
The Soviet Union bought 9.05 million tons of wheat and 5.17 million tons of corn for delivery in the fifth year of its grain-supply agreement with the United States. It also bought 830,000 tons of soybeans and 1.3 million tons of soybean meal. The agreement is scheduled to expire on Sept. 30.
Cattle futures posted strong gains in a late surge of pre-weekend position squaring on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Pork futures retreated on fears of slackening demand.

Abstract: * The ''national self'' cannot be the central geopolitical or economic option. Technology, markets and power do not lie primarily in debt-depressed, politically unstable Latin America but in the Pacific basin and North America. Third, on the contentious issues of drugs and migration, the United States could abandon unilateral measures in return for a greater Mexican willingness to recognize that their ''domestic'' policies affect American interests and are legitimate topics for negotiations. One possible deal: For the next several years, the United States could agree to accept a larger number of Mexican migrants if Mexico would place greater emphasis on job creation. Such initiatives would not be charity: They are bargains based on reciprocity. Most important, they are rooted in the conviction that it is in America's interest for Mexico's globalists to prosper. A successful Mexican perestroika could provide the United States with a more affluent, democratic, less distant neighbor.

MEXICO will choose a new President on Wednesday. The near certain election of Carlos Salinas de Gotari will accelerate an intellectual revolution that is driving Mexico beyond its defensive, inward-looking past and toward a more receptive, internationalist future. This shift toward globalism offers a tremendous opportunity for improving Mexican-American relations.
Mexicans are re-examining their place in the world. Mexico turned inward after its 1910 revolution, formulating a foreign policy designed to keep it safe from the designs of an encroaching northern neighbor. A powerful state apparatus directed the nation's energies toward developing local industry and the middle-class consumer market. The state also protected the economy from external competition and its upper and middle classes from a restless peasantry and growing urban proletariat.
This safe society enjoyed solid growth with low inflation during the 1950's and 60's. In the last 15 years, however, the luster of the ancien regime has been badly tarnished by spiraling stagflation, capital flight, and widening gaps between rich and poor. A growing number of Mexicans believe that the paternalistic state can no longer guarantee economic development or social peace.
Now, Mexico is turning toward an alternative, globalist perspective based on these tenets:
* The old policies of protecting do mestic producers from imports have run their course. Mexican industry must now confront global competition.
* Economic national security can no longer be guaranteed by a rigid state that itself tries to provide jobs, investment and new technology. Closing the doors to internal investment and foreign technologies, and frustrating the drive for integration into the global trading and financial markets would not preserve Mexican sovereignty but only increase its vulnerability.
* The ''national self'' cannot be the central geopolitical or economic option. Technology, markets and power do not lie primarily in debt-depressed, politically unstable Latin America but in the Pacific basin and North America.
The Mexican Government has begun to act on these realizations. To force industry to become more efficient and competitive, Mexico has slashed tariffs and joined the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. A competitively valued peso is also focusing the attention of Mexico's entrepreneurs on foreign markets.
The globalists count among their numbers the Harvard-trained social scientist Carlos Salinas and his team of like-minded, often Americantrained technocrats. Nevertheless, the predominance of the globalist approach is far from assured. It still faces formidible opposition from some traditional politicians, government bureaucrats, smaller businessmen and many intellectuals.
Moreover, several roadblocks stand in the way. To begin with there is stagflation. Unless the three-digit inflation that plagued Mexico in 1987 can be tamed, globalism will become identified with price instability and falling real incomes.
Next is the problem of foreign debt. Mexicans unanimously want to reduce interest payments that are draining the country of investment capital and fueling inflation. However, the globalists eschew unilateral actions that might frighten the very foreign capitalists they wish to attract.
Then there is the problem of low investment. Without a return of business confidence, private investors will not create new, world-class industries. Business managers need steadier macroeconomic policies, price stability and expanding markets at home and abroad.
Social inequity is also a perennial problem for Mexico. Globalists have cleverly attributed Mexico's glaring inequalities to ancien regime policies that guaranteed companies monopoly profits and that subsidized the upper-middle class. However, the strength of political opposition on the left and right indicate that the globalists are vulnerable to the charge that their modernization campaign has lowered real wages and threatens many smaller, less competitive firms.
Finally, there is continued political disruption. Globalist economics could provide a structural foundation for a flowering of democracy in Mexico. By reducing the power of the fused ruling party-Federal bureaucracy, globalism offers an opening for competing interests. The strategic tasks facing the Salinas administration will be to smoothly manage the transition from a one-party state to a more pluralistic system.
THESE are serious challenges. The responsibility for overcoming them is Mexico's, but American policy makes a difference:
First, the net resource transfer from Mexico to international financial markets should be reduced by half. The United States can create a regulatory and political environment that encourages commercial banks to extend new loans or grant relief on old debts. Increased flows from multilateral agencies and capital-surplus countries like Japan can also spur investment and support globalist economic reforms.
Second, in both bilateral and multi- lateral forums, the United States and Mexico can reciprocally reduce trade barriers and avoid building new ones.
Third, on the contentious issues of drugs and migration, the United States could abandon unilateral measures in return for a greater Mexican willingness to recognize that their ''domestic'' policies affect American interests and are legitimate topics for negotiations. One possible deal: For the next several years, the United States could agree to accept a larger number of Mexican migrants if Mexico would place greater emphasis on job creation.
Fourth, the United States can adopt a diplomatic posture that neither undermines the Mexican Government through public scorn nor smothers it in an ostentacious embrace. Matter-of-fact recognition of progress when deserved, and careful and precise criticism when warranted, will most likely stimulate positive responses.
Such initiatives would not be charity: They are bargains based on reciprocity. Most important, they are rooted in the conviction that it is in America's interest for Mexico's globalists to prosper. A successful Mexican perestroika could provide the United States with a more affluent, democratic, less distant neighbor.

Abstract: In its semiannual economic outlook report, the O.E.C.D., a group of 24 industrial democracies formed to promote cooperation and noninflationary growth, said that while the near-term risk of recession had receded substantially since October's stock market plunge, ''an inflation risk is beginning to reappear in several countries.'' The View on U.S. Inflation Increasing private savings and reducing the budget deficit would reduce inflationary pressures, the group said. In the absence of progress on these fronts, the report stated, ''the orientation of monetary policy would need to be tighter over the next year or so to contain inflation.'' It added, ''Interest rates may need to move higher in the period immediately ahead in view of emerging price pressures.'' The Inflation Threat In its outlook the O.E.C.D. projects that inflation in the United States will be at an annualized rate of 3.75 percent for the second half of this year and 4 percent next year. But Mr. [David Henderson] said, ''A further significant fall in the dollar or stronger growth and lower unemployment than we project could cause greater-than-expected inflation.''

Full text: LEAD: The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development warned today of inflationary pressures in the United States but said the overall economic outlook for the industrial world appeared stronger than it seemed six months ago.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development warned today of inflationary pressures in the United States but said the overall economic outlook for the industrial world appeared stronger than it seemed six months ago.
The organization's officials said that because their fears of the depressing effect of the stock market fall had not been borne out, they had revised their outlook. They now expect economic growth in the industrialized world to be 3 percent this year, compared with the 2.25 percent they projected in December. They also project growth to be 2.5 percent next year, compared with last December's forecast of 1.75 percent.
In its semiannual economic outlook report, the O.E.C.D., a group of 24 industrial democracies formed to promote cooperation and noninflationary growth, said that while the near-term risk of recession had receded substantially since October's stock market plunge, ''an inflation risk is beginning to reappear in several countries.'' The View on U.S. Inflation
The report is based on data accumulated through early May. In a news briefing today, David Henderson, the organization's chief economist, said that at least for now, inflation in the United States remained under control. Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d said the same thing last month at an O.E.C.D. meeting in Paris.
The organization also expressed concern that the pace of reducing the American trade deficit might be so slow that it could jeopardize the stability of the currency exchange markets. The group said that reduction of the trade deficit could be slowed by continued strong growth in the American economy, especially in domestic demand. Such strong growth would ''also pose a risk of accelerating inflation, since margins of unused capacity and unemployed labor have become very thin in some sectors and regions,'' it said.
Increasing private savings and reducing the budget deficit would reduce inflationary pressures, the group said. In the absence of progress on these fronts, the report stated, ''the orientation of monetary policy would need to be tighter over the next year or so to contain inflation.'' It added, ''Interest rates may need to move higher in the period immediately ahead in view of emerging price pressures.'' The Inflation Threat
In its outlook the O.E.C.D. projects that inflation in the United States will be at an annualized rate of 3.75 percent for the second half of this year and 4 percent next year. But Mr. Henderson said, ''A further significant fall in the dollar or stronger growth and lower unemployment than we project could cause greater-than-expected inflation.''
The organization did not criticize West Germany as much as it had in previous reports for not doing more to spur economic growth. O.E.C.D. economists said Bonn's leeway to stimulate the German economy was constrained by a deficit expected to equal 2.6 percent of the nation's budget.
''West Germany is growing faster than we and others had projected it would,'' Mr. Henderson said. He said this was not so much because of policy measures as because of stronger-than-expected export growth.
The O.E.C.D. projects that West Germany, which has the biggest economy in Europe, will grow by 2.25 percent this year and 1.75 percent next year. Six months ago it estimated that Germany's economy would grow by just 1.5 percent this year and 1.25 percent next year.
The report praised Japan for stimulating its domestic demand and economic growth. It praised Britain's fast growth, but said that nation has to worry about a trade deficit and inflation. France was praised for low inflation but warned about a trade deficit, while Italy was scolded about its huge budget deficit.

Abstract: Superpower status has always required a sense of mission that the Japanese lack, says Prof. Edwin O. Reischauer, a Japan scholar at Harvard and the American Ambassador to Tokyo in the 1960's. ''We speak of making the world safe for democracy and we apply our ideas to everyone,'' he said. ''The Japanese have none of this sense of empire. They have trouble even joining a United Nations peacekeeping force.'' If no single nation can dominate, economists say, one of two alternative is likely to develop. One would have the United States and Japan share leadership, with Japan supplying the economic muscle and the United States the political and military strength. That is the solution sought by Mr. [Noboru Takeshita]. ''The Japanese are pushing hegemony away,'' Mr. Reischauer said. ''They want to move toward a system of greater interdependence.'' Japan not only shuns political assertiveness and military power; it also worries that America's economic decline might also erode its political and military power. That would ''put an unwanted burden on Japan,'' writes Ronald Morse of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in the current issue of Foreign Policy magazine. ''The Japanese believe they need the United States to get safely into the 21st century.''

Full text: LEAD: Japan's growing economic strength is gradually dislodging the United States as the dominant economic power of the non-Communist world. But despite its gains, Japan remains unwilling - and probably unable - to shoulder many of the responsibilities that have traditionally gone with global leadership, according to many economists and historians.
Japan's growing economic strength is gradually dislodging the United States as the dominant economic power of the non-Communist world. But despite its gains, Japan remains unwilling - and probably unable - to shoulder many of the responsibilities that have traditionally gone with global leadership, according to many economists and historians.
The Japanese, in fact, are clinging to partnership with the United States - junior partnership - insisting, as Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita did on his first official visit to Washington this month, that ''the very foundation of Japan's prosperity'' depends on being America's partner.
The Japanese reluctance to upstage the United States, combined with the American economic decline, means that the Western industrial world is entering one of its rare periods without a dominant leader. With no nation today setting the course charted in the 19th century by Britain and later by the United States, the possible consequences are daunting:
* The dollar and other major currencies would go on fluctuating dramatically in value, perhaps into the 21st century, because none of the industrial nations can agree on fair exchange rates and the United States lacks the clout to impose standards, as it once did.
* Trade disputes would persist, with neither the United States nor Japan able to dominate each other or their various trading partners. As a result, the free trade system that the United States imposed after World War II could founder, with the world breaking up into competing trading blocs.
* Overcapacity in manufacturing, already a problem, could worsen as each trading bloc or major industrial nation - operating without international restraint - tried to develop a full set of industries. The total output would be much more than the world's consumers could possibly buy. Recession and unemployment might result.
* The loss of economic power may also cause United States military and political influence to decline in such strategic areas as the Middle East and Latin America. That has happened to other dominant nations, says Paul Kennedy, a Yale historian, in a new book, ''The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers,'' that speculates on America's fate.
The West, in sum, would fall into the fractiousness and prolonged economic distress that plagued the 1920's and 30's, the last period in which the world lacked a ''hegemonic'' power. In those years, Britain was losing its dominance and the United States had not yet emerged as the global leader.
Less powerful countries have often been critical of the way Britain and the United States used their power, accusing them of exploitation. Nevertheless, the dominant power has performed a number of vital functions in the world economy, said Charles Kindleberger, an economic historian at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. These have included providing stability and economic stimulus, by opening its borders to nations that had no other marketplace.
The United States did this for a desperate Europe and Japan after World War II. The United States kept on buying their products when they thrived once again, in the 1970's and early 1980's. But no nation is flinging open its borders to unlimited imports today, although the non-Communist world is living through a period of too much production and not enough buyers. Similarly, no nation fulfilled the role of marketplace of last resort during the 1930's, when world trade was drying up.
In addition, the world's economic leader should serve as the lender of last resort, Mr. Kindleberger said, a role that went unfilled in the case of troubled and inflation-ridden Germany in the 1920's. In the coming decade, some nation might have to do this job for third world nations unable to keep up with debt payments.
''There has to be a hegemonic force and I come to that conclusion reluctantly,'' Mr. Kindleberger said.
But many believe that it might not be possible for Japan or any other nation to achieve the hegemonic power that came to Britain in the days of Queen Victoria and Edward VII and to the United States in the Truman and Eisenhower years. For one thing, while Japan is coming to control more of the world's wealth than the United States, the United States economy, measured by the total value of the goods and services that Americans produce, is still the largest in the world - three times the size of Japan's, which is second.
In addition, the United States has military strength and political clout - two other components of global leadership - that far surpass any other non-Communist nation, and Japan has shown no inclination to assume greater military or even political responsibilities.
Superpower status has always required a sense of mission that the Japanese lack, says Prof. Edwin O. Reischauer, a Japan scholar at Harvard and the American Ambassador to Tokyo in the 1960's. ''We speak of making the world safe for democracy and we apply our ideas to everyone,'' he said. ''The Japanese have none of this sense of empire. They have trouble even joining a United Nations peacekeeping force.''
If no single nation can dominate, economists say, one of two alternative is likely to develop. One would have the United States and Japan share leadership, with Japan supplying the economic muscle and the United States the political and military strength. That is the solution sought by Mr. Takeshita. ''The Japanese are pushing hegemony away,'' Mr. Reischauer said. ''They want to move toward a system of greater interdependence.''
In the other scenario, trading blocs would emerge, around West Germany in Europe, the United States in the Western Hemisphere and Japan in Asia. Each would be a world within itself, trading with the other blocs. The European Common Market, of course, is already operating in this way, with Germany the strongest force. And some experts view the bilateral agreements recently negotiated by the United States with Mexico and Canada, in which a number of trade barriers were removed, as the start of a Western Hemisphere bloc.
The transition from American postwar dominance to some new alignment is drawing considerable attention to the issue of global leadership. Indeed, hegemony, a word seldom heard in the postwar years, is showing up frequently today, not only in journals devoted to foreign policy and economics, but also in newspaper and magazine articles about Western leadership, and in newly published histories, such as Mr. Kennedy's. Japanese Prowess
The issue is coming to a head because of Japan's spectacular success over the past 18 months in adjusting to an overvalued yen, and the failure of the United States to get enough mileage out of a weak dollar. The yen's strength should have reduced Japan's wealth by making its exports too expensive. But Japan's manufacturing and marketing prowess has allowed it to revamp its business practices without giving up the huge sums that have flowed in from abroad since 1981.
That is in sharp contrast to the American experience in the early 1980's. When the dollar was very strong and the yen was weak, American business went through the same adjustment as the Japanese, but the result was a huge deficit, not a surplus - a deficit that continues to grow, despite the advantages of a weak dollar.
Japan, in effect, is demonstrating a skill that the United States and Britain had in their heydays: the ability to accumulate great wealth whatever the value of its currency.
The reinvestment of this wealth around the world will make other nations more dependent on Japan, says Robert E. Cole, a Japan expert at the University of Michigan.
One way in which Japan is offsetting the handicap of a strong yen is by becoming a nation of enthusiastic consumers instead of exporters heavily dependent on the United States market. While its total exports shrink, Japan's domestic consumption is rising at an annual rate of 10 percent and its economy is growing strongly. Second, Japan is beginning to rely on a new source of wealth. As a big supplement to earnings from exports, the Japanese are beginning to harvest profits and interest from the huge sums that continue to be invested abroad, in factories, real estate, stocks and bonds.
Indeed, the transformation of Japan into a nation of consumers and coupon clippers is occurring much more rapidly than most Americans realize, said Martin S. Feldstein, president of the National Bureau of Economic Research and a former chairman of President Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers.
In addition, the insular Japanese, who until the 1980's manufactured little outside their homeland, are moving production abroad, mainly to factories in the United States, but also to other countries with weak currencies and therefore lower costs. They are thus forming an international network similar to the one developed by American companies in the postwar years, albeit a smaller one.
The income flowing into Japan from all this overseas activity and from exports rose to more than $80 billion last year from about $50 billion in 1985, when the yen began its rise. In the heyday of its power after World War II, the United States, despite its much greater size, never managed to collect so much wealth from the rest of the world, even when adjustments are made for inflation. Power of the Purse
As the Japanese spend their riches, they are making decisions that will force on them the mantle of world economic leadership, experts say, no matter how much they might like to defer to the United States.
To take an example, Japan is becoming the chief source of new funds for the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, which until now have depended on the United States and have been controlled by Americans. And the Japanese are becoming major lenders and investors in Latin America, roles that carry the power to insist that the Latins buy Japanese goods.
Using similar leverage until recent years, the United States made Latin America a big purchaser of American products. The United States is trying to revive this relationship, through its political assertiveness and military presence. But the financing power is passing to Japan.
With economic dominance also comes the power to set the rules for trade. Both Britain and America used their power to enforce a free trade system, because it worked to their benefit. But the advantage lasted only as long as their products and technology were considered the best in the world and were eagerly sought by other nations.
Now that Japanese goods are the favored imports, free trade is beginning to lose its American sponsorship. The decline of free trade as a guiding principle leaves a policy vacuum. Some Japanese argue that their nation should be taking the lead by replacing the free trade concept with a Japanese vision of how the world's economies should behave; as yet, however, no such view exists, the Japanese themselves acknowledge.
Meanwhile, the Commerce Department acts in its relations with Japan as if the United States were still the hegemonic power. That was evident at a recent conference in New York, when Louis F. Laun, the assistant secretary for international economic policy, lectured a group of prominent Japanese executives and economists.
The Japanese Government, he said, should phase out measures that protect troubled industries from foreign competition and should stimulate consumer spending even more than it already does, by helping people to buy larger homes. ''The Japanese should have fun, loosen up, and buy,'' he said. Such paternalistic guidance increasingly draws an angry reaction in Japan, even among Japanese with strong ties to the United States.
''We get this sort of talk every day,'' said Kenichi Ohmae, managing director in Japan for McKinsey & Company, the American management consulting firm. ''Everyone in the U.S. Government talks like a General MacArthur,'' he said, referring to Douglas MacArthur, who headed the American administration of Japan after World War II. Divergent Paths
The rise of Japan as an economic giant while the United States retains military and political power generates tensions that could eventually separate the two nations and drive them along divergent paths.
The United States naval force in the Persian Gulf, for example, is protecting oil shipments that benefit Japan as much as any country. Japan has been criticized in Congress for failing to participate in the military action and, more generally, for spending only 1 percent of its gross national product on defense while the United States spends 6 percent.
The Toshiba Corporation stopped selling high-tech equipment to the Soviet Union after the United states protested that the equipment benefitted the Russian military. The Japanese Government even apologized, but some Japanese businessmen were angry that Japan had backed down. They argued that Japan needs the Communist-bloc as a marketplace for its abundance of manufactured goods.
But a policy that would incorporate such activities over the protests of the United States or other nations requires a sense of national mission and conviction that the Japanese prefer to avoid. Their reluctance stems from Japan's disastrous experience with militarism in the 1930's and 1940's and the strong Japanese sense of being apart from the rest of the world - a characteristic reinforced by the language barrier and by centuries of island isolation.
''Japan's success in this respect will require a grand design involving not only economic but also political and military matters,'' said Masahiko Ishizuka, a columnist for the Japan Economic Journal, which is widely read in the West. Shared Leadership
Japan not only shuns political assertiveness and military power; it also worries that America's economic decline might also erode its political and military power. That would ''put an unwanted burden on Japan,'' writes Ronald Morse of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in the current issue of Foreign Policy magazine. ''The Japanese believe they need the United States to get safely into the 21st century.''
This unusual division of labor prompts C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics, a public policy research organization, to argue for the revival of trilateralism, a strategy in which the United States, Japan and Germany would share the leadership of the non-Communist world. Trilaterism was first proposed in the 1970's by Henry Kissinger, David Rockefeller and others when Japanese economic power was becoming evident. It found support in the Carter Administration, which Mr. Bergsten served as a Treasury official, but has not generally been embraced by Reagan officials.
''There is only one way out: a pluralistic management,'' said Mr. Bergsten, who would extend a Japanese-American partnership to include Germany, which is the world's fourth largest economy, after the United States, Japan and the Soviet Union.
Partnership or trilateralism draws some of its appeal from Japan's failure to generate the take-charge imperial approach once shown by the United States and Britain.
The common Japanese view was expressed recently by Yutaka Kosai, president of the Japan Economic Research Center in Tokyo.
''I have mixed feelings about being a dominant economic power,'' he said, recalling his boyhood during World War II. ''We hope the United States can recover and Japan will be the second fiddle. Being No. 2 is really quite pleasant.''

What's Still Wrong With an Oil Import Fee

Abstract: * Whom do we hurt? There will be an initial world price drop from the fee, but its impact will be much bigger on our friends who are not members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries than it will be on OPEC. The 18 million barrels daily that come from friends like Britain, Canada, Norway and Mexico are higher cost, in general, than the 12 million daily barrels of cheap-to-produce Mideast supplies that Mr. [William Safire] wants to ''punish.'' That means the non-OPEC production will be first to shut in as the fee depresses the world oil market further. Wise United States policy would, in contrast, help this non-OPEC production. * Mr. Safire urges us simultaneously to push down the world price of oil with a fee, while raising oil prices in the United States. This sends the United States part of the world market in one direction, while the bigger remaining part goes in the opposite direction. The ''good'' results in the United States are trumpeted - more oil production and conservation. But the opposite ''bad'' results in the rest of the world, namely, lower production and conservation, are ignored.

To the Editor:
The oil import fee has resurfaced in William Safire's Oct. 28 column ''One Fell Swoop'' - with a greater panoply of alleged benefits than ever before. He claims the fee would help Wall Street and the Saudis, restore Texas oil production and end rising United States oil imports, pay for our Persian Gulf flotilla, stop Iranian terrorism and cut the trade and budget deficits.
The $10-a-barrel fee, however, would not only raise the price of the 5 million barrels imported daily, but would cause the price of the 10 million barrels produced domestically to rise as well. That's a consumer price jump of $150 million a day; or about $50 billion a year. Consumers would also pay billions more for similar price rises in such fuels as natural gas, which compete with oil.
Why pay more than $50 billion to cut the deficit by $23 billion? Moreover, even this claimed $23 billion deficit cut is illusory: the fee has indirect costs in inflation, higher interest rates, higher unemployment and bigger unemployment payments, costlier jet and naval fuel for our armed forces, and lost tax revenues from American businesses facing higher costs and earning lower profits.
Despite Mr. Safire's ad hominem dismissal of the Secretary of Energy, the department's energy security study persuasively demonstrates that an oil-import fee will create economic losses that are greater than the benefit from the fee. These losses mean a fee would have negligible, even adverse effects on the budget deficit.
Nor does a fee help the trade deficit. Putting American farmers, and chemical, steel, auto, plastics and other businesses at a large competitive cost disadvantage on a key input like oil will only lower United States exports. Could a United States company paying $28 beat a German or Japanese manufacturer running on $18 oil?
On the energy-security front, three observations:
* A return to $28 oil might boost domestic oil production as much as half a million barrels daily - or not quite 200 million barrels a year. United States consumers thus pay $50 billion extra for a fifth of a billion extra barrels, or about $250 a barrel.
* Mr. Safire urges us simultaneously to push down the world price of oil with a fee, while raising oil prices in the United States. This sends the United States part of the world market in one direction, while the bigger remaining part goes in the opposite direction. The ''good'' results in the United States are trumpeted - more oil production and conservation. But the opposite ''bad'' results in the rest of the world, namely, lower production and conservation, are ignored.
* Whom do we hurt? There will be an initial world price drop from the fee, but its impact will be much bigger on our friends who are not members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries than it will be on OPEC. The 18 million barrels daily that come from friends like Britain, Canada, Norway and Mexico are higher cost, in general, than the 12 million daily barrels of cheap-to-produce Mideast supplies that Mr. Safire wants to ''punish.'' That means the non-OPEC production will be first to shut in as the fee depresses the world oil market further. Wise United States policy would, in contrast, help this non-OPEC production.
Why punish our citizens and our allies to hurt our alleged enemies? Why use protectionism to cripple further a seriously depressed world market - in order to prevent a replay of 1929?
Finally, two of Mr. Safire's key claims are off by a factor of 10. Gaining half a million barrels of extra United States production cannot plausibly be billed as the end of our Mideast oil dependency, nor is it the end of the one-fourth of our trade deficit that comes from oil imports.
The deficit and energy-security problems will require lots of tough decisions. Let's not encourage people to avoid these useful actions by touting a counterproductive proposal as a panacea. PHILIP R. SHARP Washington, Oct. 29, 1987 The writer, chairman of the House Subcommittee on Energy and Power, represents Indiana's 2d Congressional District.

Silver futures rose today on buying by traders who saw the precious metal as a cheap way to insure against inflation, but gold closed lower as traders awaited United States-Japanese discussions on trade problems.
Analysts said the silver market was strongest at the start on buying by foreign-based traders who sensed that the metal was a low-price inflation hedge following this week's dramatic fall after the rising prices of the last few weeks.
''It seemed that foreign traders came in to protect the value of this morning's positions,'' an analyst said.
Silver for May delivery was up 26.3 cents, at $7.913 a troy ounce, on the Commodity Exchange in New York.
Gold futures coasted to a lower close in the slowest session of the week as traders anticipated that the Reagan-Nakasone meeting might cause fluctuations in the dollar.
Gold for delivery in June was off $1.20, at $453.50, in light trading.
Platinum futures closed with little net change in an apparent compromise amid indecision caused by firmness in silver and easiness in gold.
Platinum made its biggest rally on news of a police raid at the headquarters of South Africa's biggest trade union, which had earlier called for a nationwide protest.
Comex copper futures closed lower after being caught in the downdraft caused by a brief period of weakness in the trend-setting silver market.
At the Chicago Board of Trade, grains and soybeans closed mostly higher as clear weather indicated farmers were working in the fields rather than selling the crop.
Higher silver prices also encouraged some buying, as traders feared possible inflation ahead. But weaker gold, a stronger United States dollar and lower Treasury bonds limited gains in grains and soybeans, traders said. Trade talk that the wheat crop in Oklahoma may be smaller than expected lent some support to wheat prices.

Abstract: A bank official in Tokyo said the situation was worrisome. Despite an apparently strong report from Washington on the United States economy, the official said that ''the market judged the G.N.P. figure as showing the future weakness of the United States economy because a piling up of inventories accounted for a large part of the rise.'' ''Unless the United States shows a firm stance to stop the fall of the dollar, it won't stop,'' the bank official said. ''But even that seems to be coming too late.'' Later, economists focused more on the fact that the G.N.P. had risen on the strength of a large increase in business inventories, thus ''robbing growth from the second quarter,'' said James T. McGroarty, a vice president and trader at the Discount Corporation in New York. As a result, he said, the dollar began to sell off because of fears that the economy was weakening.

The dollar broke below 140 yen this morning, trading at 139.05 yen, despite hectic intervention by the Bank of Japan.
A bank official in Tokyo said the situation was worrisome. Despite an apparently strong report from Washington on the United States economy, the official said that ''the market judged the G.N.P. figure as showing the future weakness of the United States economy because a piling up of inventories accounted for a large part of the rise.''
The official said that even the widening gap in interest rates between Japan and the United States -rates in the United States are now nearly five percentage points higher than in Japan - is not causing the Japanese to cling to dollars.
''Unless the United States shows a firm stance to stop the fall of the dollar, it won't stop,'' the bank official said. ''But even that seems to be coming too late.''
On Thursday, the dollar closed at 141.15 yen in Tokyo - its lowest level since modern exchange rates were set in the late 1940's. At the start of this month, the dollar had traded at about 147 yen. Down in New York
By The Associated Press In New York trading, the dollar dropped sharply against the yen yesterday, as new data touched off fears that the economy was sluggish and inflation would climb.
The dollar, which was also lower against most other major currencies, fell to 140.725 yen, from 142.25 late Wednesday.
Gold and silver prices rose sharply. The Republic National Bank in New York quoted bullion at $459.50 an ounce at 4 P.M., up $10.75 from late Wednesday.
The dollar was initially lifted by the Commerce Department's report that the nation's gross national product increased by 4.3 percent in the first quarter. Traders had expected a rise of about 2.9 percent.
But later, economists focused more on the fact that the G.N.P. had risen on the strength of a large increase in business inventories, thus ''robbing growth from the second quarter,'' said James T. McGroarty, a vice president and trader at the Discount Corporation in New York. As a result, he said, the dollar began to sell off because of fears that the economy was weakening.
As part of its report, the Government said that inflation was up in the first quarter, with a price index tied to G.N.P. climbing at an annual rate of 3.6 percent, the sharpest quarterly increase in three years. The gain was attributed to higher energy prices.
In New York, the pound jumped to $1.6445, from $1.6280.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Wednesday's, were: 1.8060 West German marks, down from 1.8250; 1.4715 Swiss francs, down from 1.4955; 6.0075 French francs, down from 6.0725; 1,288.00 Italian lire, down from 1,300.50, and 1.33445 Canadian dollars, down from 1.33305.

MEXICO'S NEW TYPE OF EMIGRANT: WELL-TO-DO, SKILLED, DISILLUSIONED

Abstract: ''There is a considerable percentage of people here who by birth are entitled to choose whether to work in the United States or Mexico because they have dual citizenship,'' said Dr. Guillermina Villalva, director of the Ciudad Juarez branch of the College of the Northern Border. ''Whereas before, the majority did not opt to work in the U.S., especially those who had high social or intellectual levels, now we find that 80 percent are deciding to work and live in the U.S. This is a serious loss for Mexico.'' A Man's Breaking Point: Company Is Nationalized Doctors, nurses, translators and language teachers are among the occupation groups that have swelled the exodus, Dr. Villalva said, joining skilled craftsmen such as carpenters and plumbers. United States officials here say stonemasons, cabinetmakers, shipyard workers, pipeline fitters and computer operators, as well as ''budding entrepreneurs frustrated with the system,'' are also heavily represented in the outflow. ''I can't prove it, but it seems to me Mexico is losing some of its most aggressive young people,'' said Alan Eliason, chief of the United States Border Patrol station in San Diego. ''It's not the weakest ones that are making the trek up here: they're exporting some of their best and their brightest.'' ''A street sweeper or a dishwasher in the United States earns more than a brilliant professional here,'' he added. ''You can't buy a house, you can't buy a car, your wife has to go to work just to make ends meet. A lot of people just end up saying, 'I can't go on living in this system,' and opt for living overseas.''

Full text: Acting quietly, the father-and-son team that runs one of Mexico's leading industrial groups recently liquidated most of the men's assets here. Then they boarded their personal planes and flew north to new homes and headquarters in Aspen, Colo., and La Jolla, Calif.
When a lifelong resident of the Mexican capital finished a regular visit to the dentist recently, he was surprised to be told not to bother coming back. The dentist was closing his practice and moving to the United States the next day with his family, the patient was told.
Amid its most serious domestic crisis in nearly half a century, Mexico has begun exporting a new type of emigrant who could not be more different in background than the workers and peasants who have traditionally left in search of opportunity. Thousands of established, affluent professionals, ranging from prominent businessmen and intellectuals to skilled craftsmen and ambitious young college graduates, are reluctantly joining what Mexicans call ''la fuga de cerebros'' - ''the flight of brains.''
The primary cause of this outflow of talent, according to diplomats, immigration specialists and the emigrants themselves, is the severe economic downturn that has gripped Mexico since 1982. But underlying the exodus is what they describe as a deeper ''frustration'' or ''disenchantment'' with the political and social system, dominated by the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, that has prevailed in Mexico for more than 50 years.
The number of professionals who have elected to leave Mexico is far smaller than the more traditional flow of farm workers and other unskilled laborers back and forth across the border. But Mexican businessmen and scholars and foreign diplomats agree that the consequences of the recent outflow of professionals are potentially far more dangerous for Mexico.
The illegal immigration of unskilled workers into the United States has been widely viewed as a safety valve for a sputtering economy that cannot create enough new jobs to accommodate the one million entrants to the Mexican labor force each year. The loss of highly educated professionals, on the other hand, strips Mexico of the skills and experience it desperately needs if it is to resume the rapid economic growth of years past.
''In terms of the overall migration, this group almost doesn't count,'' said Jorge Bustamante, director of the College of the Northern Border in Tijuana, referring to the professionals. ''But the impact of their departure is very serious since it deprives us of the human capital we need for our development and represents the loss of a tremendous investment on the part of Mexican government and society.''
At the Border Stations, A Change Is Noted The United States Immigration and Naturalization Service estimates it will make 1.8 million apprehensions - including many people caught more than once - along the Mexican border this year, up from 1.2 million last year. Figures on the occupational status of detainees are not kept, but I.N.S. officials say their border stations are reporting an increase in the number of educated and professional Mexicans being detained.
''There is a perception on the border that there are more people with higher-level skills coming in,'' said Duane Austin, an I.N.S. spokesman in Washington. ''We seem to be running into more middle-class people and family units than we did before the big influx that began with the start of their economic crisis.''
In fiscal 1985, the last year for which official statistics are available, 241 Mexicans were admitted to the United States under special preference visas for professionals and 694 as skilled or unskilled workers, including technicians. In the previous year, the figures were 7 and 25, according to I.N.S. figures.
But those statistics, Mr. Austin cautioned, do not include Mexican professionals who may have entered the United States under other programs, such as those for Mexicans who have immediate relatives in the United States. Nor do they take into account what immigration officials believe are significant numbers of middle- and upper-class Mexicans who overstay tourist visas or who illegally cross the border on foot.
''There is a considerable percentage of people here who by birth are entitled to choose whether to work in the United States or Mexico because they have dual citizenship,'' said Dr. Guillermina Villalva, director of the Ciudad Juarez branch of the College of the Northern Border. ''Whereas before, the majority did not opt to work in the U.S., especially those who had high social or intellectual levels, now we find that 80 percent are deciding to work and live in the U.S. This is a serious loss for Mexico.'' A Man's Breaking Point: Company Is Nationalized Doctors, nurses, translators and language teachers are among the occupation groups that have swelled the exodus, Dr. Villalva said, joining skilled craftsmen such as carpenters and plumbers. United States officials here say stonemasons, cabinetmakers, shipyard workers, pipeline fitters and computer operators, as well as ''budding entrepreneurs frustrated with the system,'' are also heavily represented in the outflow.
Neither the Mexican nor American Governments have made public statistics on the outflow of talent or middle-class flight. But some scholars and consumer market researchers estimate that up to 5 percent of Mexico's urban middle class, or more than 100,000 people, may have left in the last five years.
Eduardo Perez-Verdia, a Mexican businessman who lives in Dallas, has a visa granted to foreign workers of ''exceptional ability,'' which allows him to work as vice president of strategic marketing at the Frito-Lay division of Pepsico, earning more than $100,000 a year. Mr. Perez-Verdia said his breaking point came after the appliance company of which he was president was suddenly nationalized in 1982.
''When I went to work one day, there were soldiers with machine guns there and they wouldn't let us in,'' he said. ''When I was finally able to return to work, I found that I was working in a totally different environment, as a government bureaucrat with no future.''
Other factors in his decision to leave Mexico, he said, included constant currency devaluations and a high income tax rate. He also says he was embittered by an experience as a poll watcher in which ''I delivered one set of figures, which when they were published weeks later were totally rigged,'' thus strengthening his conviction that ''fraud is just rampant'' in the political system.
''It was very difficult to leave, it was something I had never seriously considered, though I had many opportunities,'' said Mr. Perez-Verdia, who has a master's degree in business administration from Columbia University. ''But I had the realization there were enormous abuses at a national scale, and that nothing had been done or was going to be done.'' On a Return Visit, He Finds Disillusion Mr. Perez-Verdia, 41, said he hopes eventually to go back to Mexico, in part because he would like his three children to retain their Mexican identity. But a recent visit to relatives here left him pessimistic about an early return.
''Disenchantment with the system and open abuses of government are now very widespread,'' he said. ''Under the last three presidents, the situation in the country has just gone to hell, and people start losing hope after a while.''
Immigration experts and scholars say many other professionals are leaving in spite of the stake they have here and the comfort in which some of them can live. An American official here said he realized that patterns of Mexican emigration to the United States were changing ''when I started meeting a lot of people asking me, 'Can I take a maid with me when I go?' ''
''There is definitely an interest among the professional classes in seeking opportunities outside of Mexico, perhaps for the first time since 1910,'' said Craig Dudley, president of Conrey Interamericana, an executive recruitment concern here. ''Some have just gone up and done it on their own, while some who work for transnational companies are seeking very hard to get transferred.''
Nevertheless, one United States official here says it is primarily ''the young and hungry ones who are leaving,'' college-educated men and women ''in the 20-to-35 age bracket'' who are products of increased opportunities in the Mexican education system but who are entering the labor market at a time when jobs are extremely difficult to find.
According to Mexican Government statistics, the number of students enrolled in Mexican universities grew by more than 300 percent between 1970 and 1985, to 1.2 million. The number of people graduating from college each year increased by more than 400 percent in the same period, to 123,000 last year.
''I can't prove it, but it seems to me Mexico is losing some of its most aggressive young people,'' said Alan Eliason, chief of the United States Border Patrol station in San Diego. ''It's not the weakest ones that are making the trek up here: they're exporting some of their best and their brightest.''
''We are definitely getting more educated people in the flow, occasionally even government employees,'' he added.
Jose, a 25-year-old civil engineering graduate of the University of Chihuahua, fits that profile on all counts. He came to Mexico City after the earthquake a year ago with hopes of finding a satisfying job and aiding in the rebuilding of the capital, but quickly found his idealism crushed by what he describes as a pervasive pattern of nepotism and petty self-interest.
''The chief engineer in the section in which I was working went out and hired his wife, son and son-in-law, as well as more distant relatives,'' he complained. ''It doesn't seem just to me that in order to get somewhere in Mexico you have to be the son of lawyer so-and-so or engineer such-and-such.''
In May he quit his job in disgust and went to the United States on a tourist visa. He now works as a bartender in Chicago, studying English in his spare time in anticipation that he will eventually be able to legalize his status in the United States and work in his own profession.
''I'd like to go back home if I could, but the situation is bad, very bad,'' he said. ''There's a way to change things, but they don't want to.''
To most Mexicans, talk of a talent flight comes as a shock. Because of the country's high growth rates and liberal policy of political asylum, Mexico has traditionally been on the receiving end of a talent flight from other Spanish-speaking countries.
''Prior to 1982, Mexico was unusual in that it had virtually no brain drain, in contrast to countries like Argentina and Chile,'' said Manuel Garcia y Griego, who studies Mexican emigration at the Colegio de Mexico, a major research institute here. ''But since 1982, the Mexican pattern has come to look more and more like the rest of Latin America.'' Mexicans' Buying Power Has Faded Rapidly Both Mexican and foreign analysts agree that the key to stemming the talent outflow is a resumption of economic growth. But that turnabout must come soon, they say, a prospect that does not seem realistic at the moment.
According to independent economic analysts, buying power here has declined in each of the last five years, by a total of more than 40 percent. As a result, per-capita income, as measured in constant dollars, has now fallen to $1,875, compared to $2,200 in 1981.
Economic forecasts have predicted the economy will shrink an additional 3 to 4 percent this year. In addition, the Mexican Government has said that inflation this year will exceed 100 percent, and the peso is now valued at about 750 to the dollar, compared to 24 in early 1982.
''The slide of the peso and the rise in inflation over the last year and a half have really accelerated the crisis psychology here,'' said a United States official. ''It has brought about a deterioration in the status of life for the middle class that has caused some to move and many more to think of it.''
''There is definitely a movement outward,'' he added. ''There is a lot of analysis and soul-searching going on right now.''
Professional groups representing doctors and architects, many of whom were trained and educated in the United States, say the exodus has been especially significant in their areas. But researchers in the hard sciences also appear to have been hit hard as a result of cutbacks in program financing, fellowships and imported equipment and materials.
''The situation of scientists is much more acute than that of doctors or architects,'' said Alfonso Vilchis, professor of Microbiology at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. ''It is not that there is bad will on the part of the Government, but rather that there is a scarcity of resources.'' Mexican Viewpoint: 'A Loan of Talent'
For Rafael Rodriguez, a 24-year-old marine biologist who works at the Secretariat of the Ecology, is an unpaid part-time researcher at a university institute here and has conducted research for the Cousteau Society, the situation has already gotten out of hand. He has been offered a graduate fellowship at a university in Texas and expects to leave Mexico in January.
''The only way to live and be able to study is to go abroad,'' Mr. Rodriguez said dejectedly. ''As a graduate student in the United States, I will earn more than the director of the institute in which I work here.''
''A street sweeper or a dishwasher in the United States earns more than a brilliant professional here,'' he added. ''You can't buy a house, you can't buy a car, your wife has to go to work just to make ends meet. A lot of people just end up saying, 'I can't go on living in this system,' and opt for living overseas.''
''I can earn less here or more there,'' Mr. Rodriguez, who makes less than $250 a month, said. ''But the important thing is to develop my career, to put into practice the knowledge I have obtained.''
Mexican Government officials, however, say that talk of a talent drain is exaggerated. While acknowledging that significant numbers of Mexican professionals and technicians are taking advantage of job opportunities in the United States and Europe, Franklin Rendon, director of technological development at the National Council of Science and Technology, estimates that ''no more than 1 percent'' stay abroad permanently.
''In reality, we do not have a brain drain,'' Mr. Rendon said in an interview here in September. ''What we have is a permanent flux, a permanent interchange, particularly with the United States.''
''There are invitations from abroad, and the participation by Mexicans sometimes prolongs itself for two or three years,'' he said. ''But the majority, I would say almost the totality, come back to the country.''
''I would not speak of a brain drain,'' Mr. Rendon concluded. ''I would regard it as a loan of talent.'' ----NEXT: The governing party's hold on Mexican political life.

Full text: A year ago the five major industrial powers forged a historic compact to drive down the value of the dollar in hopes of easing a crushing trade imbalance.
The drop in the dollar has been stunning. Since the meeting of the five nations last Sept. 22 at the Plaza Hotel in New York, the dollar has plunged 55 percent in value against the yen and 40 percent against the West German mark.
But the broader objectives of correcting trade flows and reinforcing international cooperation have proved stubbornly elusive.
The United States faces a trade deficit approaching $200 billion this year -up sharply from $148.5 billion in 1985 -along with a rising clamor for protectionism and increasing strife with its leading trading partners over their reluctance to spur economic growth.
Another Recession Is Feared
''Deep fissures in the world economy'' have appeared, Paul A. Volcker, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, told a gathering in Venice last month.
Things are so serious that some economists are warning that if the rest of the world does not grow fast enough to buy more American products, the United States will stumble into another recession. And a slowing of the American economy, in turn, would likely choke off demand for foreign goods, thus touching off a dangerous downward spiral throughout the world.
''Frankly, I'm very worried about the recessionary danger,'' said Rimmer de Vries, senior vice president of the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company. ''We're not getting the growth abroad.'' Robert D. Hormats, a former senior Reagan Administration economic official and now an investment banker with Goldman, Sachs & Co. said, ''I think we must call a Plaza II meeting to deal with the trade imbalances that are threatening economic disaster.''
Plaza I, the secretly convened Sunday gathering a year ago that produced the agreement to lower the dollar's value, was born out of the huge and prolonged rise in the currency from mid-1980 until February 1985, the largest such movement in history. U.S. Trade Affected
By lifting prices of exports and lowering prices of imports, the inflated dollar undermined American international competitiveness.
The Plaza participants - the United States, Japan, Britain, France and West Germany - reasoned that deflating the dollar would help put world trade back in balance, setting the stage for more stable and consistent growth. But economists say several factors deprived the accord of its expected results.
* The concentration of the monetary changes on too small a cluster of currencies, leaving out several of the United States' most important trading partners.
* The preference of many foreign companies to reduce profits or even take losses rather than cede market share in the United States.
* The reluctance of West Germany and Japan to spur economic growth, which would enhance American export opportunities, for fear of renewed inflation.
* The immediate perverse effect in all devaluations. The trade deficit at first widens because, with the lower value of the dollar, imports come in at a higher value. It is only later that higher prices curb their volume.
* The erosion of the American agricultural trade balance because of foreign subsidies and a global grain surplus.
* The growing pressure on debtor countries to use their export earnings to pay interest to banks on their foreign debt instead of buying goods from the United States and other industrial countries. New Talks Sept. 26
Finance ministers from the five countries involved in the Plaza accord customarily meet several times a year. They conferred at the economic summit conference last May in Tokyo and at the Interim Committee meeting of the International Monetary Fund last April.
The question of the trade imbalances is certain to arise at a session they are tentatively scheduled to hold in Washington on Sept. 26, on the eve of the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. This session of the finance ministers could conceivably lead to some fresh monetary decisions affecting trade.
Meanwhile, major trading nations are locked in tough debate in Punta del Este, Uruguay, over the shape of a future trading system that could open up markets for the United States in data transmission, insurance and other services in which the American economy has special strength. Profits and Jobs Affected
Although the dollar began to ease in early 1985, Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d invited his counterparts from West Germany, Japan, Britain and France to New York last September to hasten the process.
Mr. Baker's action came in response to enormous pressure from American business and labor, whose profits and jobs were being hurt by the high dollar.
It marked the reversal of an earlier policy of benign neglect, in which Washington did little to influence the dollar's market movements. Yet the dollar may have been primed to move in any case, as some economists have noted.
''The market was ready for a change, ready, we may say, with the benefit of hindsight, to prick the speculative bubble that in 1984 developed and pushed the dollar to its excessive high,'' Gottfried Haberler, resident scholar of the American Enteprise Institute, wrote in a recent paper. An Implicit Threat
In the Plaza accord, which spoke of closer cooperation to ''encourage'' a weaker dollar, was the implicit threat of dollar sales from government treasuries. Market operators took note and sold dollars more quickly than they might have otherwise.
But the plan to push the dollar lower relative to the currencies of the other four participants had a flaw that did not become apparent until months after the meeting. The currencies of other important trading partners did not rise with those of the Plaza countries. Indeed, about half of American trade by volume is with countries whose currencies have stayed flat or even declined against the dollar.
Against both the peso of Mexico, this country's third-most-important trading partner, after Canada and Japan, and the cruzeiro of Brazil, which is No. 12, the dollar is now sharply higher.
The Canadian dollar is still below the level of last Sept. 22, at the time of the Plaza meeting. South Korea's currency, the won, moves with the dollar. Taiwan's dollar has appreciated a modest 10 percent.
All these countries have built large trade surpluses with the United States. Currency Shifts Sought
Mindful of the devaluation gap, American negotiators are now seeking discussions with a number of these countries to increase the value of their currencies, Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige told Congress earlier this month. He singled out the Canadian dollar as a currency that should be stronger.
The Federal Reserve Board's ''Trade-weighted U.S. Dollar Index'' has fallen more than 30 percent from its peak in February 1985. But because of the exclusion of Mexico, Brazil, Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong and others from this indicator, the decline is exaggerated, many economists say.
Steve H. Hanke, a professor of economics at Johns Hopkins and chief economist of Friedberg Commodities Management Inc. of Chicago, placed the dollar's real fall at ''6 to 7 percent'' on the broader trade-weighted basis. Growth-Rate 'War'
While ushering in some new currency talks, the Plaza agreement also set off what some are calling ''the war of the growth rates.''
Underlying the accord was the pledge of the five countries to more closely coordinate their economic policies. Each participant outlined intentions to provide ''a more balanced expansion with low inflation.''
The United States said it would ''implement fully'' a budget deficit reduction package. West Germany promised ''vigorous, job-creating growth in the context of stable prices and low interest rates.'' Japan said it would increase private consumption and investment and provide a ''pro-growth environment for the private sector.''
The zenith of cooperation was reached last March when coordinated policies led to interest rate cuts by the United States, West Germany and Japan. In the United States there have now been four successive cuts in the Federal Reserve discount rate, which stands at 5 1/2 percent, the lowest level since 1977. Charges Traded
But in recent months there have been mutual recriminations as the United States has stepped up pressure on West Germany and Japan to increase economic growth, while those countries have criticized the United States for laxity in reducing its budget deficit.
To try to get its way, the United States has been using the dollar as a kind of monetary battering ram, some analysts say.
Mr. Baker and Mr. Volcker have warned both Bonn and Tokyo that Washington might be forced to let the dollar fall even more against the mark and the yen if those countries did not cut their interest rates further or take other steps to increase growth. [ On Wednesday, West German and Japanese central bankers reiterated earlier statements that they did not expect to cut their interest rates. In reaction, Mr. Baker again said that the dollar might need to decline further. On Thursday, the currency fell below two marks to the dollar, the lowest point in five years. ] By raising export prices, the higher mark and yen tend to have a depressing effect on the German and Japanese economies.
Yet both countries are afraid of stoking the fires of inflation, which they say could result from greater economic stimulus.
This view finds strong political support, especially in West Germany, which fears inflation more than most countries because of the hyperinflation of the 1920's that helped to usher in the Hitler era.
''The financial markets are betting on renewed inflation,'' said David M. Jones, senior vice president of Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, government bond dealers in Wall Street. ''If there's a choice between world recession and world inflation, the markets are saying we'll choose inflation.''

Abstract: While changes in energy prices and currency values have profound effects on inflation, their timing is different. Changes in oil prices alter the inflation rate within six months. A currency decline raises import prices, but not for about 18 months, because foreign manufacturers are at first willing to absorb unfavorable currency swings in narrowed profit margins rather than give up hard-won market share. Some have argued that excess industrial capacity worldwide will check inflation. Unfortunately, recent periods of stagflation have taught us that excess capacity can be a weak constraint on inflation. The dollar's recent slide will allow domestic producers to raise prices to restore profit margins badly shrunk by the dollar appreciation of 1981 to 1985, even if factory utilization rates remain low - a process we have already begun to see in autos and other industries producing tradable goods. THE relevant issue is not so much the average level of excess capacity but the distribution of it. Idled factories have not prevented home shelter prices from rising at a 6 percent rate so far in 1986; nor have they held down price increases for medical care (8 percent), new cars (5 percent), entertainment services (4 percent), and miscellaneous goods and services (6 percent). Service prices rose at a 5 percent annual rate during the first half of the year and, since they account for half the C.P.I., assure a rebound in inflation after the oil-price decline plays out. The rekindling of inflation has a kind of inevitability to it. Its seeds were planted by economic policy shifts over the past few years, especially the sharp increase in the Federal deficit.

Full text: REPORTS of the death of inflation are greatly exaggerated.
By the end of this year, stabilized energy prices, the delayed effects of a falling dollar and domestic economic policy will all push consumer prices ahead at an annual rate of about 4 percent, headed toward 6 percent by the end of 1987.
Right now, however, the inflationary forces building in the economy are being masked by transitory events - falling oil prices and the after-effects of an overvalued dollar. As a result, many economists and policy makers continue to insist, erroneously, that the major danger to the economy is deflation, not inflation. The error of this thinking becomes evident when one examines the dynamics of the inflationary forces at work today.
While changes in energy prices and currency values have profound effects on inflation, their timing is different. Changes in oil prices alter the inflation rate within six months. A currency decline raises import prices, but not for about 18 months, because foreign manufacturers are at first willing to absorb unfavorable currency swings in narrowed profit margins rather than give up hard-won market share.
Once sorted out, the interaction between oil prices and the dollar tells an interesting story: Both have lowered inflation in the first half of 1986. Without this year's tumble in oil prices -more than 50 percent since December - consumer prices would have risen at a 3 percent annual rate this year. Instead, they have fallen slightly. And the rapid dollar appreciation of 1984 and early 1985 was still holding down the overall price level this year, even though the trade-weighted dollar has declined some 30 percent since early 1985.
Later this year, however, oil and the dollar will begin working at cross-purposes, as the recent currency depreciation starts putting significant upward pressure on domestic prices. In 1987, as the effects of the weaker dollar overtake the shorter-lagged oil-price decline, inflation will accelerate. In fact, each 10 percent drop in the trade-weighted dollar can be expected to add at least three-quarters of a percentage point to consumer price inflation.
Some have argued that excess industrial capacity worldwide will check inflation. Unfortunately, recent periods of stagflation have taught us that excess capacity can be a weak constraint on inflation. The dollar's recent slide will allow domestic producers to raise prices to restore profit margins badly shrunk by the dollar appreciation of 1981 to 1985, even if factory utilization rates remain low - a process we have already begun to see in autos and other industries producing tradable goods.
THE relevant issue is not so much the average level of excess capacity but the distribution of it. Idled factories have not prevented home shelter prices from rising at a 6 percent rate so far in 1986; nor have they held down price increases for medical care (8 percent), new cars (5 percent), entertainment services (4 percent), and miscellaneous goods and services (6 percent). Service prices rose at a 5 percent annual rate during the first half of the year and, since they account for half the C.P.I., assure a rebound in inflation after the oil-price decline plays out. The rekindling of inflation has a kind of inevitability to it. Its seeds were planted by economic policy shifts over the past few years, especially the sharp increase in the Federal deficit.
Rather than producing a supply-side miracle, the deficits led to high real interest rates, which discouraged private investment in plant, equipment and housing while attracting foreign money. The flood of foreign capital, in turn, bid up the price of the dollar.
The dollar appreciation, of course, led to a trade imbalance that short-circuited economic recovery, especially in the agricultural and industrial Middle West. As a result, by last year the economy was teetering on the edge of a recession that worried policy makers more than the prospect of renewed inflation. The financial condition of many companies was still weak from the last recession, real interest rates remained exceptionally high, third world countries were struggling to service their debts and the dollar continued strong.
Not surprisingly, our policy was redirected to lowering the dollar and interest rates. As noted earlier, the trade-weighted dollar has been dropping sharply; and real interest rates for most borrowers outside the energy sector have come down significantly. This shift in economic policy - essentially the adoption of an easy money policy by the Federal Reserve - provided the final assurance that inflation would return.
The key to breaking the links in the inflationary chain is to eliminate the fundamental imbalance between domestic saving and domestic borrowing resulting from the sharply increased Federal deficit. This will be accomplished either by a return to budget balance, a deep and prolonged recession or inflation - or some combination of all three.
Washington has shown little deficit-cutting resolve, and recession has been judged unacceptable, at least for now. The consistent and continuing policy emphasis has been to increase consumption at the expense of saving, investment and productivity growth. That leaves inflation as the only option.

Abstract: The willingness of the Japanese, Germans and others to go along with the Americans in a ''managed float,'' or quasi-managed float, was a concession to President Reagan's insistence that something be done to help correct the United States trade deficit, before Congressional protectionism gets out of hand. But the Japanese and Germans refused to yield to American pressures to increase their growth rates as a means of expanding their markets for United States exports and keeping more of their own goods home. The Americans, however, have not said ''uncle'' on their demands for faster growth abroad, especially on the part of the Germans, with their key role in Europe. Then, addressing the annual banquet of the Columbia University Business School at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, Mr. [Paul A. Volcker] said of himself and his fellow central bankers, ''We get paid to worry.'' He quoted Aristotle on the ''virtue of the golden mean,'' adding that he was not giving Delphic support to a return to the gold standard. In fact, the new monetary accord announced in Tokyo is what some are calling an ''information standard'' - one that, in the words of a senior United States official, ''lives and breathes on information and rumor and innuendo.'' The currency accord is aimed at regularizing and defining the factual bases and criteria of the information standard. He called for a more ''sophisticated'' approach, with different actions in different countries, and said the United States should not ''put all the necessary solutions off on other countries.'' Most of all, it should fix its budget deficit; the action taken so far, he said, ''was not enough to put the deficit on a declining trend.'' As for monetary policy, the area of his own direct responsibility, it would be ''pragmatic.''

Full text: THE just-ended Tokyo conference marks a cautious but constructive step toward greater economic cooperation among the seven largest industrial democracies. Immediately after the agreement on a plan to help stabilize currencies was announced, there was enthusiasm in the United States stock and bond markets, which apparently concluded that the conference's outcome implied a further decline in interest rates and a spur to investment and economic growth.
But despite the agreement on the plan to heighten coordination of fiscal and monetary policies in the interests of exchange rate stability, the dollar dropped sharply against the yen, reflecting the foreign exchange market's belief that the dollar has a good way still to fall before the American trade deficit can be closed.
Ironically, though Secretary of the Treasury James A. Baker 3d and his deputy, Richard G. Darman, have in the past expressed a strong interest in stable target zones for the dollar and other currencies, they now insist they have no targets in mind. And, just as ironic, the West Germans and the Japanese, devotees of floating exchange rates, are now insisting that the mark and the yen have risen quite enough, thank you, as they worry about losing competitiveness in world markets.
The willingness of the Japanese, Germans and others to go along with the Americans in a ''managed float,'' or quasi-managed float, was a concession to President Reagan's insistence that something be done to help correct the United States trade deficit, before Congressional protectionism gets out of hand. But the Japanese and Germans refused to yield to American pressures to increase their growth rates as a means of expanding their markets for United States exports and keeping more of their own goods home. The Americans, however, have not said ''uncle'' on their demands for faster growth abroad, especially on the part of the Germans, with their key role in Europe.
Speaking of the Germans, a senior American official said: ''They're the one country that hasn't joined in this most recent interest rate reduction. And they haven't joined in it in the face of a negative inflation rate, not a zero rate but probably a negative rate, and in the face of a 9 percent unemployment rate.'' He added that the Germans ought to look at their monetary policy to help them grow faster, and consider moving up their tax cuts and liberalizing their capital markets.
While the heads of government and their finance ministers drew up plans in Tokyo, the central bankers, including Paul A. Volcker, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, stayed home. In New York, shortly after the accord on international policy coordination was announced in Tokyo, Mr. Volcker, who has been called the second most powerful man in the country, cautioned a reporter who asked him his view of the agreement, ''Don't go too fast - they're going to play it by ear.''
Then, addressing the annual banquet of the Columbia University Business School at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, Mr. Volcker said of himself and his fellow central bankers, ''We get paid to worry.'' He quoted Aristotle on the ''virtue of the golden mean,'' adding that he was not giving Delphic support to a return to the gold standard. In fact, the new monetary accord announced in Tokyo is what some are calling an ''information standard'' - one that, in the words of a senior United States official, ''lives and breathes on information and rumor and innuendo.'' The currency accord is aimed at regularizing and defining the factual bases and criteria of the information standard.
Despite his professional sobriety, Mr. Volcker, taking note of the ''exuberance'' in the financial markets, observed, ''There's a lot to be happy about.'' He cited rising output in the fourth year of the expansion and the growth of employment, the absence of signs of a downturn, the decline of inflation with the help of falling oil prices, the lowering of interest rates and the signs of a pickup abroad.
But he balanced these items by saying that ''the economy is not all that strong.'' He reminded his fellow speaker, Roger B. Smith, chairman of the General Motors Corporation, that he had recently trimmed auto production. And he said that offices are in oversupply, the energy and farm sectors are weak, and the depreciation of the dollar is ''not an unalloyed joy.'' The economy has underlying imbalances; debt has grown too fast, and the budget and trade deficits have made the United States unduly dependent on the inflow of foreign capital.
On the mechanism for international fiscal and monetary coordination, Mr. Volcker said, ''I'm not against it.'' Countries had to worry about getting the right mix of policies. ''But I object to everybody having to move in lockstep,'' he added.
He called for a more ''sophisticated'' approach, with different actions in different countries, and said the United States should not ''put all the necessary solutions off on other countries.'' Most of all, it should fix its budget deficit; the action taken so far, he said, ''was not enough to put the deficit on a declining trend.'' As for monetary policy, the area of his own direct responsibility, it would be ''pragmatic.''
Weighing the balance, Mr. Volcker concluded that this is ''a time for optimism, a time for opportunity; after the years of turmoil, there can be years of growth - a good harvest, if we do the hard work.'' The post-Tokyo mood has increased optimism about the future, not only in the markets but even among central bankers paid to worry.

Abstract: On Thursday the United States Treasury Secretary, James A. Baker 3d, said that ''the main aim'' of this week's meeting was to secure a clear commitment from the rest of the world to reverse ''the growth gap'' between the United States and its trading partners, enabling the United States to increase exports, reduce its trade deficit and counter mounting protectionist pressure in Congress. West Germany and Japan refused to give such a clear commitment, conference sources said. Instead, they settled for a general pledge to ''take advantage ''of more favorable world conditions to promote ''a stronger growth trend over the medium term without rekindling inflation,'' coupled with a declaration that countries with big trade surpluses should stimulate demand for imports. Secretary Baldridge said today that the Reagan Administration was ''profoundly disappointed'' that the meeting failed to resolve the long-standing dispute over subsidized export credits with Europe and Japan, accusing these trading partners of failing to control ''this predatory practice.''

As ministers of 24 members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ended an annual review of the Western world's economic outlook, senior United States officials also displayed growing irritation at unresolved trade disputes with Europe and Japan.
In their final communique, the O.E.C.D. ministers expressed satisfaction with the improving economic prospects in the West, including quickening economic growth and lower inflation, helped by the recent sharp drop in oil prices. They said these developments could pave the way for a new round of interest rate cuts aimed at stimulating industrial investment.
Change in Communique
But at West German and Japanese insistence, the communique failed to include a statement inserted by the United States into earlier drafts that stated, ''Generally Europe and Japan are called on to contribute more to world economic growth.''
Instead, the communique said only that Western policy priorities include ''reduction of the U.S. budget deficit, increased domestic demand and the encouragement of increased imports into Japan and the strengthening of growth in European and other member countries through both structural and macroeconomic policies.''
The mixed results of this year's O.E.C.D. meeting mean that the United States will be going to next month's economic summit meeting in Tokyo dissatisfied with the cooperation it is receiving from its major commercial partners on growth and trade. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige said that some of this week's issues were likely to be raised by the United States at the Tokyo meeting.
On Thursday the United States Treasury Secretary, James A. Baker 3d, said that ''the main aim'' of this week's meeting was to secure a clear commitment from the rest of the world to reverse ''the growth gap'' between the United States and its trading partners, enabling the United States to increase exports, reduce its trade deficit and counter mounting protectionist pressure in Congress.
Even this year's projected improvement in United States trade would leave the deficit at ''politically intolerable levels,'' he said.
However, West Germany and Japan refused to give such a clear commitment, conference sources said. Instead, they settled for a general pledge to ''take advantage ''of more favorable world conditions to promote ''a stronger growth trend over the medium term without rekindling inflation,'' coupled with a declaration that countries with big trade surpluses should stimulate demand for imports.
Secretary Baldridge said today that the Reagan Administration was ''profoundly disappointed'' that the meeting failed to resolve the long-standing dispute over subsidized export credits with Europe and Japan, accusing these trading partners of failing to control ''this predatory practice.''
He also expressed concern over the continuing standoff between the United States and the Common Market on American farm exports. They stand to suffer as a result of the admission of Spain and Portugal to the Common Market this year.
Secretary Baldrige angrily accused Japan today of ''refusing to negotiate'' on measures to curb its interest rate advantage.
Mr. Baker warned on Thursday that the farm trade dispute with the Common Market could lead to ''open trade warfare'' and imperil plans for a new round of trade negotiations later this year.
Despite the specific disagreements, O.E.C.D. ministers endorsed the opening of the proposed new multilateral trade negotiations following a ministerial meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in September.

Abstract: Both Mr. [Paul A. Volcker] and his institution have been accused of being preoccupied with inflation at the cost of jobs. In a rare dig at the Fed, and maybe at himself, Mr. Volcker said that Fed policy makers as a body expected almost 4 percent inflation this year and some slight speed-up in 1986. But ''I personally think,'' he said, ''we will do better than that.'' The policy-making committee ''in its majesty has overestimated inflation in each of the last four years,'' he said. The Fed rebased the money supply in 1983 as well. Last week's action predictably drew criticism from monetarist economists, who prescribe a constant annual rate of money growth rather than a discretionary rate. ''The fact that the inflation rate is very low at the moment is reminiscent of the 1960's and 1970's,'' said Allan Meltzer of Carnegie Mellon Institute. The most likely outcome, he said, was that the Fed would ''wait too long'' to slow money growth, producing a resurgence of inflation, ''and then will slow down too much.'' Mr. Volcker, arguing that the link between money and the economy is not constant, asserted a ''need for a considerable degree of judgment rather than precise rules.'' For example, he said the Fed could drive down the dollar faster to shrink the trade deficit, but won't lest it run excessive risks of inflation. Even so, the Fed, a frequent target of criticism by the White House and Congress, won praise. ''We're pleased with it,'' Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d said. And it escaped censure from House Democrats. They seemed to agree with the Fed that the budget deficit is the central problem.

Full text: With its report that economic growth this spring was disappointing, its warning from Federal Reserve chief Paul A. Volcker not to count on the central bank to push interest rates much lower, and its continuing impasse on House and Senate negotiations to shrink the Federal budget deficit, last week did little to ease the creeping sense of uncertainty about the economic outlook.
The latest Government reports showed continued weakness in June in manufacturing and mining. The economy as a whole, the Commerce Department said in its report on the gross national product in the second quarter, expanded at an annual rate of 1.7 percent. That is much less than the initial 3.1 percent estimate but more than the negligible first-quarter gain of 0.3 percent. The growth rate for the first half of the year was a negligible 1 percent, only a whisker away from stagnation. This raised questions about the staying power of the expansion, almost three years old.
Still, the Administration stuck to its forecast of a stronger second half after learning that last month business investment surged, consumer outlays held firm and personal income advanced. Imports, which soared last winter because the strong dollar has made them cheap, showed only a slight spring rise. But exports continued to slide. ''The trend in exports is now decidedly weak,'' with the slack having spread from farm to factory, said Aubrey H. Zaffuto, economist at J. Henry Schroder Bank.
The financial markets seemed to take divergent views. The New York Stock Exchange, evidently optimistic about the outlook for profits, punched out three new highs, with the Dow Jones industrial average ending the week at a record 1359. Bonds prices retreated after Mr. Volcker's testimony, which gave no encouragement to those who seek another cut in the Fed's discount rate.
Mr. Volcker's warning of the limits on how much the Fed can help came in his semi-annual report to Congress on monetary policy and the economy. He was uncommonly optimistic about keeping inflation down below 4 percent. But he cautioned that the economy was marred by ''gross imbalances that can neither be sustained indefinitely nor dealt with successfully by monetary policy alone.'' The United States, Mr. Volcker said, was consuming too much, saving and investing too little, and borrowing and buying too much abroad. That borrowing, he said, included a ''disquieting'' rise in corporate debt to finance takeovers and mergers.
As if to validate the last imbalance he cited - ''too many borrowers at home and abroad remain under strain or overextended'' - the Bank of America reported a $338 million second-quarter loss, caused by the bank's doubling its cushion for bad loans. The action came under pressure from a crack team of Federal bank examiners, dispatched from New York to get tough with the country's second biggest bank. A more encouraging report about financial institutions came from the savings and loan industry, which after several lean years forecast record 1985 profits, except for that 10 percent of the thrifts which continue to lose money.
'Accommodative' Policy

Unlike the economy as a whole, the thrifts have been helped by the large decline in interest rates in recent months. But the economy as a whole may yet respond. In the guarded language of central bankers, Mr. Volcker told a House Banking subcommittee that though there were limits to what the Federal Reserve could achieve, it was trying to stick to an ''accommodative'' monetary policy. He was more worried about the economy, he said, than about recent growth of the basic money supply at a rapid pace that he said was not necessarily inflationary. The Fed, he reported, was raising the benchmark from which it would calculate second-half growth of the basic money supply (currency plus checking accounts).
Both Mr. Volcker and his institution have been accused of being preoccupied with inflation at the cost of jobs. In a rare dig at the Fed, and maybe at himself, Mr. Volcker said that Fed policy makers as a body expected almost 4 percent inflation this year and some slight speed-up in 1986. But ''I personally think,'' he said, ''we will do better than that.'' The policy-making committee ''in its majesty has overestimated inflation in each of the last four years,'' he said.
Yet Mr. Volcker worried that if the Fed creates too much money and the dollar falls too much, the extra liquidity and the higher cost of imports could trigger faster inflation. The dollar has fallen 15 percent or so this year, though it rebounded late last week.
The Fed rebased the money supply in 1983 as well. Last week's action predictably drew criticism from monetarist economists, who prescribe a constant annual rate of money growth rather than a discretionary rate. ''The fact that the inflation rate is very low at the moment is reminiscent of the 1960's and 1970's,'' said Allan Meltzer of Carnegie Mellon Institute. The most likely outcome, he said, was that the Fed would ''wait too long'' to slow money growth, producing a resurgence of inflation, ''and then will slow down too much.''
Mr. Volcker, arguing that the link between money and the economy is not constant, asserted a ''need for a considerable degree of judgment rather than precise rules.'' For example, he said the Fed could drive down the dollar faster to shrink the trade deficit, but won't lest it run excessive risks of inflation. Even so, the Fed, a frequent target of criticism by the White House and Congress, won praise. ''We're pleased with it,'' Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d said. And it escaped censure from House Democrats. They seemed to agree with the Fed that the budget deficit is the central problem.

Abstract: Many economists who, a year ago, were warning of an imminent collapse of the dollar have now begun to say it may stay up for years to come. The new Morgan Economic Letter, released this week by the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company, sees ''a growing perception on the part of foreigners that the United States is a highly attractive place to lodge funds.'' Among the reasons for this: higher interest rates here than elsewhere, the more dynamic American economy and ''the safe-haven appeal of a country that offers political stability.'' ''Neither the unusual funds-gathering role of American banks nor the foreign investment in the United States can be counted on indefinitely,'' the Morgan economists say. ''But there is also little reason to expect either an imminent decline in large capital flows to this country or a major weakening in the dollar.'' ''While in some cases the fears of investors may have been exaggerated,'' he said, ''the perception that the United States is a safe and secure place for funds is not.'' He contended that, relative to any other country in the world, ''the United States continues to have an advantage.''

Full text: AFTER soaring to record heights this week, the dollar fell back yesterday. But the soaring dollar still promises to reach new altitudes this year. Before falling and later recovering a bit in New York yesterday, it rose abroad to 3.47 against the West German mark, and some traders and analysts think it could climb to 3.6 marks or perhaps all the way up to 4 marks. And the British pound fell as low as $1.04 before rising to $1.06; a buck for a pound seems inconceivable to those who can remember when the pound was worth nearly $5.
How long can the high-flying dollar stay aloft? R.T. McNamar, the former Deputy Secretary of the Treasury, suggests that, thanks to the strong inflow of foreign capital to the United States, the dollar will stay permanently strong. In a recent speech to the National Foreign Trade Council in New York, Mr. McNamar suggested that the dollar's strength, despite the record United States trade deficit, was due to the preference of investors all over the world to put their money here more than in any other country.
This preference, the result of a search for maximum, safe, after-tax returns, he asserts, stems basically from the resurgence of United States economic growth. The American economy grew by 6.8 percent last year, compared with the average growth rate of 2.3 percent for the four largest European economies and the 5.5 percent growth rate of Japan. The United States growth rate has sextupled from its rate of slightly above 1 percent in 1979-80, while the other countries have been essentially flat. The persistently low European growth rates and the higher Japanese rates, according to Mr. McNamar's theory, explain why the European currencies have fallen so far against the dollar, and why the Japanese yen has declined much less.
At his news conference last week, President Reagan embraced the economic growth theory for the dollar's rise and indicated a reluctance to intervene in currency markets in any effort to drive the dollar down. Paul A. Volcker, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, indicated his own reluctance to intervene in the exchange markets, and speculators took this as a cue to bid the dollar higher. Yesterday, Mr. Volcker said that intervention perhaps had not been forceful enough, and traders took this to mean that action might be more forceful in the future. Without United States cooperation, it is unlikely that foreign governments can intervene on a large enough scale to force the dollar down.
Mr. McNamar contends that the steep decline in the rate of United States inflation, relative to other countries, has also helped to strengthen the dollar. The strong dollar is itself a source of disinflationary pressure. Within the United States, it curbs exports and spurs imports, giving Americans more goods to consume than they produce. Internationally, the dollar's strength is depressing commodity futures, which this week fell to a 23-month low. Gold dropped $12.30, to $282 an ounce on Monday, a five-and-a-half-year low, before rising yesterday.
Many economists who, a year ago, were warning of an imminent collapse of the dollar have now begun to say it may stay up for years to come. The new Morgan Economic Letter, released this week by the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company, sees ''a growing perception on the part of foreigners that the United States is a highly attractive place to lodge funds.'' Among the reasons for this: higher interest rates here than elsewhere, the more dynamic American economy and ''the safe-haven appeal of a country that offers political stability.''
''Neither the unusual funds-gathering role of American banks nor the foreign investment in the United States can be counted on indefinitely,'' the Morgan economists say. ''But there is also little reason to expect either an imminent decline in large capital flows to this country or a major weakening in the dollar.''
Many foreigners and Americans are asking these days, ''Where else would you put your money?'' Indeed Mr. McNamar puts heavy stress on this country's safe-haven role for capital. Investor concerns, he says, have ranged from the impact of East European debt problems on German banks to political instability and turmoil in the Middle East and the debt situation in Latin America, which in recent weeks has flared up again.
''While in some cases the fears of investors may have been exaggerated,'' he said, ''the perception that the United States is a safe and secure place for funds is not.'' He contended that, relative to any other country in the world, ''the United States continues to have an advantage.''
But is all this new-era talk? The flight to the dollar, driving up its price, is certainly not an unmixed blessing. It is intensifying the problems of American farmers and other exporters. It is exacerbating protectionist pressures, as producers try to offset the damages resulting from an overvalued dollar. And Mr. Volcker said yesterday that the dollar's rise was inhibiting the conduct of monetary policy, seemingly implying that the Fed might be supplying more money to the economy than it would prefer, thereby eventually contributing to upward pressure on prices.
By forcing other countries to raise interest rates as a means of preventing further declines of their currency, the soaring dollar is threatening to make a sick world economy even sicker. Yet a precipitate fall in the dollar would also destabilize the United States and other countries. We shall consider these problems, and what to do about them, in another column.

Abstract: ''People are concerned that we are going to see another round of oil-price cuts,'' said David Nelson, director of metals futures research at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. Traders still view inflation-adjusted rates of interest in the United States as attractively high, said David Arbesman, first vice president at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. ''They are looking at the differential on real rates of return between the United States and the rest of the world and are finding that, while the differential is smaller, it still favors the United States,'' he added. In London, fears of falling oil prices were cited for pushing the pound below $1.20 for the first time since mid-October. ''The pound is friendless and its decline could become self- perpetuating,'' said a brokering accountant, Paul Neild. He said the British Government was showing no sign of interest in propping up sterling.

Full text: Gold tumbled yesterday to its lowest level since the middle of 1982 on prospects for continued low inflation. The dollar, meanwhile, surged despite falling interest rates.
The decline in gold prices accelerated as the day progressed. The Republic National Bank in New York quoted the late bid for gold at $331.75 a troy ounce as of 4 P.M., down from $340 an ounce on Friday.
''People are concerned that we are going to see another round of oil-price cuts,'' said David Nelson, director of metals futures research at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
Falling oil prices, he added, tend to depress the prices of precious metals for two principal reasons. One is that a decline in oil prices would reduce inflationary pressures in the short run, Mr. Nelson said. He noted that many investors buy gold as a hedge against inflation.
Less Revenue for Producers
The other reason, he added, was that an oil-price decline could mean lower revenue for Middle East oil producers that have been heavy buyers of gold.
Gold opened lower in Asia, falling to $340.82 a troy ounce in Hong Kong from Saturday's close of $341.25. Later, in Europe, gold closed at $337 an ounce in London, down $4.25 from Friday. In Zurich, gold also closed at $337 an ounce, down $5 from Friday. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery tumbled $8.80, to $331.20 an ounce. That was the lowest close for gold since it finished at $322.60 an ounce on July 8, 1982, according to the Comex statistics bureau.
In the currency markets, the dollar advanced despite recent declines in American interest rates.
In the latest demonstration of the interest-rate trend, several major United States banks yesterday cut their prime lending rates, or the benchmark against which they measure rates on short-term business loans, by a quarter percentage point, to 11 1/2 percent.
Still Attractively High
But traders still view inflation-adjusted rates of interest in the United States as attractively high, said David Arbesman, first vice president at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. ''They are looking at the differential on real rates of return between the United States and the rest of the world and are finding that, while the differential is smaller, it still favors the United States,'' he added.
As the trading day began, the dollar rose to 245.60 Japanese yen from 243.45 yen last Thursday in advance of a three-day holiday weekend. In United States trading, the dollar slipped to 245.85 yen, from 245.875 yen on Friday.
In London, fears of falling oil prices were cited for pushing the pound below $1.20 for the first time since mid-October. ''The pound is friendless and its decline could become self- perpetuating,'' said a brokering accountant, Paul Neild. He said the British Government was showing no sign of interest in propping up sterling.
The pound fell to close at $1.1978 in London, from $1.2170 Friday. In the United States, the pound slipped to $1.2036, from $1.21225 on Friday.
Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates Friday, included: 3.0640 West German marks, up from 3.0215; 2.5228 Swiss francs, up from 2.4985; 9.3820 French francs, up from 9.2650; 3.4545 Dutch guilders, up from 3.4160; 1,896.12 Italian lire, up from 1,874.50, and 1.3190 Canadian dollars, up from 1.3180.
Dollar rates in New York, as of 4:30 P.M., compared with late rates Friday, included: 3.05925 West German marks, up from 3.03625; 2.5265 Swiss francs, up from 2.5070; 9.3715 French francs, up from 9.32125, and 1.32005 Canadian dollars, up from 1.31815.

ECONOMIC SCENE; FOREIGN FUNDS HELP ON DEFICIT

Author: Silk, Leonard

Abstract: Some of the upsurge in foreign investment in the United States is due to high real interest rates here and the big spread between rates here and abroad. As the Morgan Bank's new Economic Quarterly observes, ''Rising real interest rates and the uptrend in the dollar's value caused borrowers to look outside American markets for cheaper funds and attracted investors' capital inflows.'' Higher United States interest rates are not the whole of the story. Foreigners have become extremely bullish on the American economy. In interviews and discussions with American journalists and bankers, they are declaring their belief that the United States economy has regained its dynamism, that prospects for profits are stronger here and that the United States is a safer haven for their capital than anywhere else in the world. ''Where else would you put your money?'' one Argentine businessman asked this correspondent. A group of leading business executives, the Committee for Economic Development, says in a forthcoming policy statement: ''Getting the deficit down will challenge our nation's ability to rise above partisan and special interest and to act in the long-term interest of our economy and society. What we do now and during the next year will be a signal to the American people and to the rest of the world as to whether or not we are willing to take responsible, decisive and comprehensive actions to restore control over our economic destiny.''

Full text: DESPITE the record trade deficit, which this year is likely to exceed $130 billion, the United States dollar continues to climb, as foreign capital floods into this country.
Net foreign investment in the United States soared to an annual rate of $77.7 billion in the first quarter of 1984 and to $80.6 billion in the second quarter, compared with $33.9 billion for all of 1983.
Some of the upsurge in foreign investment in the United States is due to high real interest rates here and the big spread between rates here and abroad. As the Morgan Bank's new Economic Quarterly observes, ''Rising real interest rates and the uptrend in the dollar's value caused borrowers to look outside American markets for cheaper funds and attracted investors' capital inflows.''
But higher United States interest rates are not the whole of the story. Foreigners have become extremely bullish on the American economy. In interviews and discussions with American journalists and bankers, they are declaring their belief that the United States economy has regained its dynamism, that prospects for profits are stronger here and that the United States is a safer haven for their capital than anywhere else in the world. ''Where else would you put your money?'' one Argentine businessman asked this correspondent.
This rising confidence in the United States economy is reflected in the change in the way foreign capital is coming to this country. Earlier, the inflows were coming through American banks, which increasingly borrowed from abroad because of the interest-rate differential.
Recently, however, money from abroad has increasingly been flowing into United States securities markets. Changed Treasury regulations allowing American corporations to issue Eurobonds - as well as the Treasury's own moves to tap that market - are strengthening the trend. The repeal of the 30 percent American withholding tax on interest paid to foreigners has further whetted the appetite for American securities.
The heavy inflow of foreign funds has made the huge Federal budget deficit tolerable, as foreign savings nearly cover the shortfall of domestic savings to finance the deficit and thus prevent a soaring of interest rates that would devastate the securities markets and stifle business capital spending, housing and durable goods purchases.
In the first quarter of 1984, the Federal deficit was running at an annual rate of $161 billion, while state and local governments were running a surplus of $54 billion, for a net Government borrowing requirement of $107 billion. However, the net inflow of foreign investment ran at an annual rate of $78 billion, covering more than three-quarters of the net Federal, state and local deficit. So the actual drain of the total government deficit has been relatively small,
But how long can this go on? Some economists believe that, if the huge net inflow of savings from abroad were to stop, chaos would follow. The Federal Reserve would be confronted with the dilemma of whether to finance the huge deficits and risk inflation, or refuse to finance them and risk depression. It would be a no-win choice.
The debate over the importance and urgency of reducing the Federal budget deficit, which forms the heart of the economic issue in the 1984 election campaign, needs to face the question of how long foreigners will be willing to go on financing America's budget and trade deficits.
Stephen Marris, a senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics, recently said in Congressional testimony that nobody knows how long this can go on - at least with any certainty. America, the richest and most powerful country in the world, he said, ''could continue to attract savings from abroad for quite some time.''
But he and many other economists think it is imprudent to count on this. He concludes that the limits of the ability of foreigners to finance the deficits will be reached by the end of next year.
Is it prudent to depend on foreigners to finance the American deficit indefinitely? Or should Americans put their own fiscal house in order?
A group of leading business executives, the Committee for Economic Development, says in a forthcoming policy statement: ''Getting the deficit down will challenge our nation's ability to rise above partisan and special interest and to act in the long-term interest of our economy and society. What we do now and during the next year will be a signal to the American people and to the rest of the world as to whether or not we are willing to take responsible, decisive and comprehensive actions to restore control over our economic destiny.''
Their anxiety contrasts sharply with the euphoria about the American economy so evident not only abroad but also in the American stock market yesterday - a soaring of spirits that is improving even more the odds on Mr. Reagan's re-election.

Abstract: Another line from Mr. [Reagan]'s inaugural address recalls a goal that remains unfulfilled. ''For decades,'' he said, ''we have piled deficit upon deficit, mortgaging our future . . . for the temporary convenience of the present.'' Far from reducing the deficit, Mr. Reagan's policies, especially a three-stage tax cut, contributed to an increase. The deficit hit a record of $195 billion in the fiscal year 1983, up from $59.6 billion in 1980. Foreign AffairsThe Reagan Administration asserts that it has ''set a new direction'' in foreign policy, ''eliminating a decade's accumulation of doubts about U.S. staying power, constancy and readiness to support our friends.'' Mr. Reagan's term has been marked by continuing controversy over Central America. He contends that the Soviet Union, Cuba and the Sandinista Government of Nicaragua are trying to ''install Communism by force throughout the hemisphere.'' Accordingly, he has sought to increase United States aid to the Government of El Salvador, which is fighting rebel guerrillas, and to the rebel groups trying to topple the Nicaraguan Government, whom he describes as ''freedom fighters'' against the Government of Nicaragua.

Full text: In three years, President Reagan has achieved much of what he promised: curbing inflation, stimulating economic growth, reducing the role of the Government, limiting access to social welfare programs.
In his inaugural address, Mr. Reagan promised to end what he called ''an economic affliction of great proportions.'' The economy is now growing faster, with less inflation, than at any time since the early 1960's. Its vigor has surprised forecasters.
But the improvements have left many individuals untouched. For some, the importance of macroeconomic gains are outweighed by dissatisfaction with specific aspects of Mr. Reagan's domestic policies. He has challenged a bipartisan consensus on civil rights developed over 20 years. He tried to shift the emphasis of environmental policy from the protection to the development of natural resources. His Administration, acting under a Congressional mandate to review the Social Security disability rolls, has cut off benefits for thousands who were later found to be disabled and qualified.
Far Short of Balanced Budget
Another line from Mr. Reagan's inaugural address recalls a goal that remains unfulfilled. ''For decades,'' he said, ''we have piled deficit upon deficit, mortgaging our future . . . for the temporary convenience of the present.'' Far from reducing the deficit, Mr. Reagan's policies, especially a three-stage tax cut, contributed to an increase. The deficit hit a record of $195 billion in the fiscal year 1983, up from $59.6 billion in 1980.
However, Republicans say the economy is in better shape than it was four years ago.
Inflation is down. The Consumer Price Index, which rose 12.4 percent in the last year of the Carter Administration, rose just 3.8 percent last year, and it rose at an annual rate of 4.1 percent in the first half of this year.
In the process, the nation went through a deep 16-month recession. The unemployment rate reached a 40- year high, 10.6 percent, in the final months of 1982, when nearly 12 million people were out of work, but it has now declined to 7.4 percent, about the same level as when Mr. Reagan took office.
Median family income rose slightly last year, even after adjustment to account for inflation. But the purchasing power of such income was 3 percent less than the purchasing power of the median family income in 1975 or 1980. And in 1983 the national poverty rate reached its highest level in 18 years.
What follows is a summary of Mr. Reagan's record in key areas.
Budget
Mr. Reagan has reduced the rate of growth in social spending and sharply increased military spending. He has, moreover, altered the terms of public debate. The usual question now is not whether to cut back social programs but how much.
Mr. Reagan's last budget said there had been a ''dramatic halt in domestic spending growth.'' While this is true, both Administration officials and their opponents tend to overstate the changes. Mr. Reagan wants to magnify his success in gaining control of the budget, while his critics want to persuade voters that the changes have caused suffering.
The effects might have been more dramatic if Congress had approved all of Mr. Reagan's proposals. Administration officials say they got slightly more than half the budget reductions they sought.
Actual Spending Cuts
Mr. Reagan has repeatedly said that he reduced only the rate of growth in social spending, not the actual level. For some programs, including Medicaid and Social Security, this is true. But it is not true with respect to housing or job training; in these programs and others, actual spending authority was reduced.
Mr. Reagan attributes the vibrancy of the economy, in part, to the 1981 tax cut, a cornerstone of his program. Less than half the revenue lost as a result of the tax cut has been made up through savings in social programs. Over the last three years the increase in interest payments on the Federal debt exceeds all the savings Mr. Reagan has achieved in health, education, welfare and social service programs.
With the increase in interest costs and military outlays, the Federal budget has grown in relation to the economy. Total Federal outlays represented 24.7 percent of the gross national product in the fiscal year 1983, up from 22.4 percent in 1980, according to the Office of Management and Budget.
Defense
From the fiscal year 1977 to 1981, military spending grew at an annual rate of 2.6 percent, after increases to make up for inflation. Under Mr. Reagan, from 1981 to 1983, it rose 7.3 percent a year.
Mr. Reagan has emphasized big strategic weapon programs such as the MX intercontinental missile and the B-1 bomber more than conventional weapons.
The military accounted for 24 percent of the budget in the fiscal year 1981 and took up 26.4 percent in 1983. In his 1985 budget, Mr. Reagan proposed to spend $272 billion on the military, 29 percent of the Federal budget. Military spending will be about 50 percent greater this year than in 1981, and 25 percent greater in real terms after accounting for inflation.
Experts say the military services are bigger, more heavily armed and better staffed as a result of the additional spending. But Congressional investigators say the United States could not sustain a war with conventional weapons against the Soviet Union, and there has been growing debate about readiness.
While generally supporting the buildup, Congress has insisted on a somewhat slower pace than the President proposed.
Foreign AffairsThe Reagan Administration asserts that it has ''set a new direction'' in foreign policy, ''eliminating a decade's accumulation of doubts about U.S. staying power, constancy and readiness to support our friends.''
At his first news conference, in January 1981, Mr. Reagan said the Russians could not be trusted because ''they reserve unto themselves the right to commit any crime, to lie, to cheat'' in order to achieve world domination. The tone of his oratory has softened recently, and this summer the Administration expressed a willingness to explore the Soviet Union's offer to begin talks on limiting antisatellite weapons.
But there have been no major agreements with the Russians on arms control or other issues, and Mr. Reagan is the first President in more than 40 years not to have had a summit meeting with a Soviet leader.
Mr. Reagan's term has been marked by continuing controversy over Central America. He contends that the Soviet Union, Cuba and the Sandinista Government of Nicaragua are trying to ''install Communism by force throughout the hemisphere.'' Accordingly, he has sought to increase United States aid to the Government of El Salvador, which is fighting rebel guerrillas, and to the rebel groups trying to topple the Nicaraguan Government, whom he describes as ''freedom fighters'' against the Government of Nicaragua.
Invasion of Grenada
The United States invaded the Caribbean island of Grenada last October. The Administration said its purpose was to protect Americans on the island, to help restore democratic institutions, to forestall a ''Cuban occupation'' and to remove ''a brutal group of leftist thugs.'' But some critics said the evidence of a major Communist threat in Grenada was not as clear as Mr. Reagan argued.
His critics say that in Central America and elsewhere, Mr. Reagan has been far too willing to use military power rather than diplomacy to achieve his goals. Just as he has moderated his public pronouncements on the Russians this year, he has in recent months begun quiet talks with the Nicaraguans and tried to play down military aspects of the struggle in Central America.
In the Middle East, Mr. Reagan contends that he has restored good relations with Israel and that he has solid ties with Egypt and Saudi Arabia, two major pro-Western governments. But the Administration's hopes of achieving major diplomatic progress in the region, along the lines set forth in Mr. Reagan's speech of Sept. 1, 1982, have been disappointed. The construction of Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank has continued, despite Mr. Reagan's criticism of the policy. Efforts by Secretary of State George P. Shultz to bring about complete withdrawal of all foreign forces from Lebanon collapsed after Syria refused to go along and forced the Lebanese to abrogate an agreement that Mr. Shultz had worked out between Lebanon and Israel in May 1983.
A truck-bombing killed 241 Americans at the Marine compound in Beirut last October, and Mr. Reagan ended the United States role in the multinational force there five months later. American standing in the region now seems to be on the rise, with Arab countries relying on the United States for help against Iran and for assistance in finding mines laid in the Red Sea.
Social Security
The President's proposals to trim Social Security, in 1981, caused such an uproar that he was forced to retreat and appoint a bipartisan commission to study the program's problems. Within three months of receiving the panel's report, Congress approved and Mr. Reagan signed a bill incorporating most of its proposals to guarantee the system's solvency.
Perhaps the biggest change was a six-month delay in the payment of annual cost-of-living adjustments, starting in 1983. The new law also increased Social Security payroll taxes, authorized taxation of benefits, called for a gradual increase in the standard retirement age and required coverage of new Federal workers and employees of nonprofit organizations.
Government actuaries said these changes would insure the solvency of the system well into the next century. But in recent months Mr. Reagan and Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan have suggested that the program might need to be re-examined before the end of the decade.
No Federal program has caused more trouble for the Administration than Social Security disability insurance. In reviewing the eligibility of those on the rolls, as required by a 1980 law, the Administration halted benefits for many people with serious mental or physical handicaps.
Social Security officials, reacting to what they described as ''horror stories,'' temporarily suspended the effort to cut off disability benefits.
Health
Medicare pays doctor and hospital bills for more than 26 million elderly and 3 million disabled people. The Reagan Administration proposed, and Congress in 1983 approved, the biggest change in the program since its creation. Hospitals that had been reimbursed for almost all ''reasonable'' costs are now paid a flat amount, fixed in advance, for treating any Medicare patient with a particular ailment. The new system, though not explicitly designed to save money, has made hospitals and doctors more cost-conscious.
Margaret M. Heckler, the Secretary of the Health and Human Services, says the Administration has ''broken the back of the health-care inflation monster.'' Critics say her statement is premature since medical costs continue to rise faster than other prices.
Laws passed with the support of the Reagan Administration require higher deductibles and premiums for Medicare coverage. Congress has rejected an Administration proposal to make people pay substantially more for the first weeks of hospital care in return for better protection against the cost of catastrophic illness.
The Administration has also slowed the growth of Medicaid, the Federal- state health program for the poor.
Poverty Programs
The Reagan Administration has made a basic change in the philosophy of social welfare programs while virtually halting their growth. Mr. Reagan has tried to limit benefits to what he calls the ''truly needy,'' and he defines the term more narrowly than any other President has since the 1960's.
The Congressional Budget Office estimated that spending had been reduced by these amounts, as opposed to what it would have been under laws existing in January 1981: Aid to Families with Dependent Children, reduced 13 percent; food stamps, 13 percent; child nutrition, 28 percent; general employment and training programs, 35 percent.
The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 eliminated cash welfare assistance for many of the working poor. In the past, welfare was intended to supplement the earnings of such people. But the Administration insists that benefits should be paid only to those who, because of age or disability, cannot work.
About one million people became ineligible for food stamps as a result of the 1981 law. Most had incomes exceeding 130 percent of the official poverty level. The law also reduced food stamp benefits for many, including some of the poor.
Rise in Poverty Rate
Hunger re-emerged as an issue in 1983. Mr. Reagan appointed a commission to study the problem. It concluded that reports of widespread hunger ''can neither be positively refuted nor definitively proved.'' But it recommended a slight increase in food assistance.
According to the Census Bureau, the poverty rate rose to 15.2 percent in 1983 from 13 percent in 1980 as the number of poor people rose by 6 million, to 35.3 million. The 1983 poverty rate was the highest since 1965. (A family of four was classified as poor if it had cash income of less than $10,178 last year.)
Mr. Reagan has curtailed spending for the construction of subsidized housing. He has redirected Federal aid into vouchers, or certificates, that low-income families can use to pay housing expenses. The Administration and its critics agree that the program represents a profound change after four decades of attempting to stimulate the production of low-income housing.
Civil Rights
Mr. Reagan has succeeded in restricting the range of remedies available for ending discrimination.
He says he disagrees with his predecessors and civil rights groups on just a few issues: he opposes busing as a means of school desegregation and quotas as a remedy for discrimination in employment and education.
But the disagreements have been more fundamental. Mr. Reagan has opposed amending the Constitution to guarantee equal rights for women. He tried to reverse a policy denying tax- exempt status to private schools that discriminate on the basis of race. (The Supreme Court rejected the Administration's position by a vote of 8 to 1.)
Voting Rights Act
The Administration initially resisted efforts to strengthen the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Mr. Reagan ultimately signed a bill passed with bipartisan support.
The Administration has tried to impose a stricter standard requiring people alleging discrimination to prove that it was intentional. Scorning broad-based affirmative action, the Administration has tried to limit relief to those who can show that they personally suffered discrimination.
After a string of losses, the Administration has won several civil rights cases in the Supreme Court. The Court adopted the Administration's narrow reading of a law that prohibits sex discrimination by schools and colleges receiving Federal aid. In a major victory for the Administration, the Court ruled that judges may not alter the rules of a valid seniority system to prevent the layoff of recently hired blacks.
Ralph G. Neas, executive director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, a coalition of national groups, speaks for the critics when he says that the Reagan team has ''the worst civil rights record of any Administration in more than half a century.'' Mr. Reagan says his critics have misrepresented his record.
Education
Mr. Reagan initially tried to abolish the Department of Education, as he promised in the 1980 campaign. In his budget for the fiscal year 1983, he said the Federal role in education ''should return to more traditional minimal levels.'' Accordingly, he proposed ''significant reductions in funding'' for almost all education programs.
Congress has consistently provided more money for education than Mr. Reagan wanted. In early 1982 he envisioned outlays declining steadily from $15.4 billion to $8.3 billion in 1987. In fact, there was a 5 percent reduction in education spending as outlays declined from $15.1 billion in 1981 to $14.3 billion in 1982. The President's budget for 1985 sought $15.5 billion.
A Presidential commission warned last year that ''a rising tide of mediocrity'' threatened American education. Mr. Reagan toured the country lamenting the state of education. He summoned schools ''back to basics,'' proposed merit pay for teachers and urged principals to crack down on discipline problems. But he did not propose any substantial increase in Federal aid.
The Congressional Budget Office estimates that three years of cutbacks have reduced spending on aid for the education of disadvantaged children by 17 percent, guaranteed student loans by 27 percent and other financial aid for college students by 13 percent, as opposed to previously anticipated outlays.
Congress has not approved Mr. Reagan's proposal to allow parents a tax credit for tuition at private or parochial schools.
Nor has Congress approved his proposal for a constitutional amendment permitting organized prayer in public schools. But it has approved a bill allowing students to hold religious meetings in schools before or after regular class hours, provided the meetings are not sponsored by the school or its teachers.
Environment
When Mr. Reagan signed a report of the Council on Environmental Quality last month, he said the nation ''has a God-given responsibility to preserve and protect'' its natural resources. He did not say that the council's budget had been reduced to $700,000 a year from $3.1 billion in the fiscal year 1980.
Mr. Reagan's top two environmental appointees were forced to resign. Anne McGill Burford stepped down as Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency in March 1983 amid charges that agency officials had been lax in enforcing hazardous waste laws, had made ''sweetheart deals'' with polluters and had manipulated toxic cleanup grants for political purposes. The allegations were not tested in court. But Rita M. Lavelle, who was in charge of the agency's toxic waste program, was found guilty of perjury and obstructing a Congressional investigation.
Interior Secretary James G. Watt resigned seven months later. His policies had angered environmental groups and their allies in Congress, but the immediate occasion was an off-the-cuff remark in praising a Federal commission on coal leasing, on which, he said, ''I have a black, I have a woman, two Jews and a cripple - and we have talent.''
Emphasis on Development
Under Mr. Reagan, the Interior Department has shifted its emphasis from the protection of public lands toward the development of natural resources. Oil and mining companies, ranchers, loggers and developers welcomed the change, as did conservatives committed to a free-market economy. But Congress imposed moratoriums on oil and coal leasing.
Agriculture
Despite Mr. Reagan's desire to curtail Government intervention in the economy, farm subsidies and price supports became more costly than ever last year. Commodity price supports and related programs cost $18.9 billion in the fiscal year 1983, up from $4 billion in 1981. Those figures do not include $9 billion worth of surplus commodities used to pay farmers under an Administration program to discourage planting excess crops.
The program, begun by Mr. Reagan in 1983, represented an extraordinary change in his farm policy, which had stressed production and little Government intervention. But depressed export markets and two years of bumper crops had created massive surpluses.
Administration officials say the program achieved its purpose, reducing stockpiles of corn, rice and cotton. But multimillion-dollar payments to some farmers drew harsh criticism.
Meanwhile, Congress approved legislation that paid farmers not to produce milk. Mr. Reagan signed the bill although he had reservations about its cost and its departure from free-market principles.
Antitrust Policy
The Reagan Administration has made fundamental changes in antitrust policy.
William F. Baxter, who presided over the antitrust division of the Justice Department for the first three years of the Reagan Administration, insisted that antitrust laws must not be used to penalize efficiency. He overhauled the department's merger guidelines.
The Administration achieved the breakup of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company through settlement of a lawsuit brought in 1974. It also dropped a 13-year-old antitrust case against the International Business Machines Corporation. The Federal Trade Commission, which shares responsibility for enforcing antitrust laws, has approved mergers and joint ventures involving such big businesses as Texaco and Getty Oil. However, it has applied the laws in novel ways to city governments, challenging, for example, local taxi regulations.
Trade
The foreign trade deficit reached a record of $69.4 billion last year. If the trend of the first five months continues, the deficit for 1984 will be $122 billion, 76 percent greater than last year.
The expanding economy and the strength of the dollar have driven demand for imports. In addition, high interest rates in this country have forced up the international value of the dollar, making it relatively cheap for the United States to import foreign goods and expensive for other countries to buy American products. Some economists contend the high interest rates result, in part, from huge Federal budget deficits. Democrats say that Administration policies contributed to the budget deficit, so Mr. Reagan must bear some responsibility for the trade deficit.
The President says he is committed to free-trade principles, but he has granted import relief to the specialty steel and motorcycle industries, tightened restrictions on textile imports and encouraged Japan to extend ''voluntary'' limits on auto sales to the United States.
Decentralization
Mr. Reagan has reduced Federal regulations and given states more authority to decide how Federal grants should be spent.
In 1981, 70 special-purpose Federal programs were merged into nine general-purpose grants. Federal officials attached few strings to the block grants, so hundreds of pages of regulations were eliminated. The grants cover broad areas like social services, preventive health and maternal and child health.
State officials have generally welcomed this aspect of Mr. Reagan's ''new federalism'' but objected to the simultaneous reduction in aid. The Federal Government spends 20 to 25 percent less for block grants than it spent for the same programs before they were consolidated. As a result, many local agencies have had to reduce services.
Congress never showed much interest in Mr. Reagan's proposal for a ''swap'' under which the Federal Government would assume all Medicaid costs while the states took responsibility for welfare and food stamps.
The Administration has found support for many of its efforts to reduce economic regulation of business, industry, prices and markets. But it has met opposition to many of its efforts to roll back health, safety and environmental rules.

REAGAN ATTACKS CONGRESS'S ROLE ON MANY FRONTS

Abstract: Mr. [Reagan] described in a clearly complaining tone the Congressional debate on the topic, '' 'Oh, bring our men home, take them away,' '' and declared: ''All this can do is stimulate the terrorists and urge them on to further attacks.'' During his news conference, the President challenged the Democrats' attempt to raise the ''fairness'' issue, decalring: ''It's probably the most glaring example of political demagoguery that our friends have been engaging in.'' He stressed that lower inflation and the tax cut have both, in his opinion, helped the poor. The Congressional Budget Office study found that families with annual incomes of less than $10,000 lost $400 in in earning power while those with incomes above $80,000 had gained $8,000. In discussing the embattled situation of Edwin Meese 3d, the Presidential Counselor and Attorney General nominee who is now the focus of a special prosecutor's inquiry, the President defended the integrity of all his appointees. He rejected ''the use of the word sleaze'' now being bandied about in Democratic broadsides, and he accused opponents of attempting ''guilt by accusation.''

Full text: President Reagan, entering the third month of his re-election campaign, challenged Congress tonight on a broad array of foreign and domestic issues.
Mr. Reagan, in a nationally televised news conference, repeatedly criticized Congress for its role on such issues as Lebanon, El Salvador aid, restrictions of the War Powers act, public school prayer, his fairness toward the poor and the ''sleaze factor'' charges being lodged against his appointees by Congressional Democrats.
The President, less than a week after withdrawing forces from the coast of Lebanon, said flatly that Congress ''must take a responsibility'' for events in Lebanon. More than 260 Marines died during the President's controversial commitment of American troops to a multinational peackeeping force in Beirut.
A Complaining Tone
Mr. Reagan described in a clearly complaining tone the Congressional debate on the topic, '' 'Oh, bring our men home, take them away,' '' and declared: ''All this can do is stimulate the terrorists and urge them on to further attacks.''
After such a commitment of troops, the President contended, ''You have rendered them ineffective when you conduct that kind of a debate in public.''
The President was noticeably more combative toward Congress, too, in denouncing as ''not helpful in what we're trying to do'' a proposal approved in the Senate that would limit his request for El Salvador aid.
He complained that such questions as the President's freedom in international diplomacy should be made subject under the War Powers Act to ''a committee of 535 individuals, no matter how well intentioned.''
His remarks this evening amounted to his strongest criticism yet of Congress's attempts to differ with or modify his policy initiatives. Response From Democrats
Congressional Democrats, equally alert to the volatility of election-year issues, quickly responded to the President, repeating their charges that his tax cut and budget policies had benefited the affluent at the expense of the poor, and that this had now been documented by the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office.
''On the issue of fairness,'' House Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. declared, ''Everyone believes the Congressional Budget Office. No one believes Reagan.''
During his news conference, the President challenged the Democrats' attempt to raise the ''fairness'' issue, decalring: ''It's probably the most glaring example of political demagoguery that our friends have been engaging in.'' He stressed that lower inflation and the tax cut have both, in his opinion, helped the poor. The Congressional Budget Office study found that families with annual incomes of less than $10,000 lost $400 in in earning power while those with incomes above $80,000 had gained $8,000.
The President made a point of noting that his budget program ''wasn't an executive order, it was passed by Congress.''
The President's performance in the half-hour session clearly pointed toward the election-year tradition of American politics by which an incumbent President often finds himself running against Congress as the chief focus in defending his stewardship. Meese Controversy
In discussing the embattled situation of Edwin Meese 3d, the Presidential Counselor and Attorney General nominee who is now the focus of a special prosecutor's inquiry, the President defended the integrity of all his appointees. He rejected ''the use of the word sleaze'' now being bandied about in Democratic broadsides, and he accused opponents of attempting ''guilt by accusation.''
''I believe the halls of government are as sacred as the temples of worship,'' he declared at his news conferene, stressing that service in his Administration demanded ''nothing but the highest integrity.''
The President defended Mr. Meese, his long-time friend and political advisor, and said he was ''not going to take any action for political expediency.''
He denied accusations that there is a steady pattern of officials leaving his Administration under charges of malfeasance, saying that they left to spare the Administration political pressure and that ''many have been cleared.''
''Its' strange that their names keep popping up again,'' he said, referring to the Democratic attempt to make a re- election year issue of the so-called ''sleaze factor.'' A Defense on School Prayer
Mr. Reagan's s tendency toward greater criticism of Congress also was clear as he defended his recent campaign to enact a Constitutional amendment to restore officially condoned public school prayer. The President said that most of the Senate had misconstrued his proposal as mandating prayer. ''We were asking nothing of the kind,'' he said.
Actually, the Reagan Administration helped defeat a compromise proposal allowing for set periods of voluntary silent prayer in public schools in order to press for its own proposal for vocal prayer periods in which unwilling students would have had to excuse themselves.
In the course of answering a question about Colorado Governor Richard D. Lamm's recent remarks on the need to permit terminally ill old people to die, the President indicated some criticism of the news media. He declined to answer the question specifically saying news accounts have not been accurate and he himself had been ''interpreted incorrectly myself some times.'' Timing Considered Important
The timing of the news conference, a day after the New York Democratic primary won by Walter F. Mondale, was considered important by the President's political advisors for the opportunity afforded the President to remind voters of his incumbency during a period when he is not campaigning heavily. It was the 23d prime-time TV news conference of his 38 months in office, and the second since he announced his candidacy for re-election.
The Meese controversy, now the focus of a court-appointed special prosecutor, had been dismissed by the President in earlier comments as a case of misperception fostered by his political opponents. The President has said that, far from engaging in job favoritism in exchange for financial favors, the members of his Administration have suffered considerable financial sacrifices in volunteering to leave the private sector for lower paying Government jobs.
The Democrats have been attempting to make Mr. Meese the symbol of a 1984 campaign issue that, in partisan attacks, has been termed the ''sleaze factor,'' an alleged pattern of misbehavior and poor judgement critics attribute to more than two score Reagan appointees in the past three years. Republicans have dismissed this as a desperate tactic resorted to by the Democrats in part because the general economic recovery has made the President's own performance in office so difficult to challenge.
Mr. Meese has denounced the controversy as baseless election-year politics and as the work of unnamed individuals who were ''peddling distortions'' to harm himself and the President. He is to remain in his job as Counselor to the President while the special prosecutor's inquiry goes forward into the 1984 election year. This will take several months, at a minimum, and White House officials concede it presents a lingering political problem, at least until the inquiry is resolved one way or the other. Mr. Meese himself requested the inquiry after pressure began mounting in the Senate.
Among the questions that might be pursued by the special prosecutor is whether there is a connection between the job appointments of a half dozen Reagan Administration officials and the fact that they had helped Mr. Meese with various aspects of his personal financial problems. A related topic involves his faliure to properly disclose to the Government a $15,000 loan he received from on of those apppointees. In addition, there is the question of how involved Mr. Meese might have been with some 1980 Jimmy Carter campaign papers found in the Reagan campaign files.

Abstract: In foreign policy, Mr. [Gary Hart] has been eager, above all else, to avoid ''another Vietnam.'' He has been quicker than Mr. [Walter F. Mondale] to criticize the deployment of American troops in Lebanon, Grenada and Central America, just as he opposed the Vietnam War several years before Mr. Mondale. Mr. Hart says that he, like millions of college students in the 1960's, learned ''the lessons of Vietnam,'' including the ''futility'' of military intervention. Mr. Mondale retorts that ''guilt is not a foreign policy'' and that the United States must be ready to use its military strength because the world is ''a tough, dangerous place'' where ''the enemies of freedom win power by force.'' Mr. Hart calls on American allies in Europe to assume responsibility for a ''greater share of the land defense of the Continent.'' He says the presence of American ground forces in Europe is less important than the goal of naval superiority that permits the United States to defend its interests at sea. But Mr. Hart says it would be a ''moral outrage'' if this country went to war to protect Middle East oil supplies for itself or Eurpoean allies. ''We never should be reduced to shedding the blood of a single American in an unnecessary war for someone else's oil,'' he said. Mr. Mondale advocates a ban on small handguns known as Saturday night specials. Mr. Hart said Wednesday in New York that he has ''opposed Federal gun control laws.'' However, he had previously expressed support for a ''cooling off period'' between the time a person buys such a gun and the time it can be taken home. This requirement, he says, would permit the authorities to check whether the purchaser had a criminal record. In a letter to a constituent, Mr. Hart said he supported ''the right of law-abiding citizens to enjoy the legitimate uses of firearms,'' and he said he would ''oppose any infringement of that right.''

Full text: Gary Hart and Walter F. Mondale have been emphasizing their differences on a wide range of foreign and domestic issues.
But the differences are more complex and more subtle than the campaign oratory would suggest. Mr. Mondale contends the Senator from Colorado has been weak in his commitment to civil rights and inconsistent in his support for arms control, while Mr. Hart contends the former Vice President has vacillated in his support of Israel. But the record of votes and public statements by the two candidates provides little to substantiate such allegations.
In foreign policy, Mr. Hart has been eager, above all else, to avoid ''another Vietnam.'' He has been quicker than Mr. Mondale to criticize the deployment of American troops in Lebanon, Grenada and Central America, just as he opposed the Vietnam War several years before Mr. Mondale. Mr. Hart says that he, like millions of college students in the 1960's, learned ''the lessons of Vietnam,'' including the ''futility'' of military intervention. Mr. Mondale retorts that ''guilt is not a foreign policy'' and that the United States must be ready to use its military strength because the world is ''a tough, dangerous place'' where ''the enemies of freedom win power by force.''
Variance on the Issues
In a Senate career spanning 12 years, from 1965 through 1976, Mr. Mondale assisted at the birth of many antipoverty programs. He was still trying to fulfill the promise of the New Deal and the War on Poverty after many began to question whether the nation could afford the cost. Mr. Hart says Democrats ''must become the party of economic growth, not redistribution,'' and he argues that ''the New Deal, although a brilliant response to the problems of the 1930's, cannot solve our problems today.''
Mr. Mondale questions Mr. Hart's commitment to civil rights, asserting that the Coloradan made virtually no reference to them in his book, ''A New Democracy.''
Mondale aides do not criticize any of Mr. Hart's votes on civil rights legislation. But Mr. Mondale says ''there's a dramatic difference in the intensity, the personal commitment'' of the two candidates. Mr. Hart replies, ''I'm not willing to let Vice President Mondale or anyone else in this country gauge my intensity of commitment to civil rights.''
Thus, Mr. Mondale criticizes Mr. Hart from the left on domestic policy, saying that his commitment to free- market economic theories has often made him indifferent to the needs of working people. But Mr. Mondale simultaneously attacks Mr. Hart from the right on foreign policy, arguing that the Senator is naive about communism and too quick to renounce the use of military force. Jackson Differs From Both
The disputes between Mr. Hart and Mr. Mondale have become increasingly bitter and seemed to reach a high point in their debate Wednesday night in New York City. The Rev. Jesse Jackson, the third major candidate in the race for the Democratic Presidential nomination, said the ''rat-a-tat-tat'' between Mr. Hart and Mr. Mondale obscured the similarity of their views. ''The reason why they are having this kind of kinship struggle,'' he said, ''is that there is such similarity in policies.''
Mr. Jackson differs in his approach to both foreign policy and domestic issues. He says the United States must show greater sensitivity to the needs of the third world, including African, Arab, Asian and Latin American countries. Likewise, at home, he says the Federal Government must pay more attention to the needs of blacks, Hispanic people, women, homosexuals, the elderly, the poor and others whom he would bring together in a ''rainbow coalition.'' But, as a relative newcomer to national politics, he has not developed his positions on some issues in as much detail as the other candidates.
Accompanying this article is a summary of positions taken by the three candidates for the Democratic Presidential nomination. Central America
Mr. Hart says, ''The commitment of United States military force to Central America cannot be the answer to the problems.'' In newspaper advertisements he says he has ''called for the immediate withdrawal of U.S. combat troops from Central America.'' He recently introduced a bill that said, ''The United States should withdraw military forces introduced into Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras or Nicaragua for training exercises or any other purpose on or after Aug. 1, 1983.''
He says Mr. Mondale ''shows a frequent unwillingness to challenge the inappropriate use of American force.''
Mr. Mondale argues, ''The lesson from Vietnam is not that we should forgo power everywhere at all times.'' Because of his long experience in government, he says, he would be more ''sure-footed'' in using power. Mondale Admits 'Mistake'
At the end of 1967, when some Senators were urging the Johnson Administration to halt the bombing of North Vietnam, Mr. Mondale said he had no ''fundamental objection to our policy in Vietnam.'' He did not publicly urge an end to the bombing until September 1968. He later said he was ''one of those that needed to be brought to his senses on the issue of Vietnam.'' He has called his initial silence ''the worst mistake of my entire career.''
Mr. Hart says, ''In the third world, the real enemy is hunger, poverty and disease, not communism.'' Mr. Jackson asserts that the revolutions in Central America are ''indigenous in origin,'' not a result of an international campaign backed by the Soviet Union or Cuba. Mr. Mondale says the main problems in the third world are both communism and poverty.
In February, Mr. Hart introduced a bill stating that the United States should withdraw its troops from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala and not send them back except to ''respond to a clear and present danger of military attack on the United States.''
While Mr. Hart wants all United States armed forces removed from Central America by the end of April, Mr. Mondale advocates a more gradual approach. ''I would draw down the number of our forces in Honduras,'' he said. But before withdrawing all troops he would seek to negotiate an arrangement with Nicaragua in which that country would agree to the removal of any Cuban forces, not to use MIG's in the region, and a nonintervention accord ''that is enforceable along their borders and throughout the isthmus.''
Mr. Jackson says this country should halt military maneuvers in Honduras, end covert operations in Nicaragua and make aid to El Salvador contingent upon improvements in human rights. He would also seek normalization of relations with Cuba.
Allied Commitments
Mr. Hart calls on American allies in Europe to assume responsibility for a ''greater share of the land defense of the Continent.'' He says the presence of American ground forces in Europe is less important than the goal of naval superiority that permits the United States to defend its interests at sea. But Mr. Hart says it would be a ''moral outrage'' if this country went to war to protect Middle East oil supplies for itself or Eurpoean allies. ''We never should be reduced to shedding the blood of a single American in an unnecessary war for someone else's oil,'' he said.
Mr. Mondale says he would ''keep faith with our European allies.'' He says he would not reduce the United States troop commitment in Europe and would help America's allies preserve their access to Persian Gulf oil.
Mr. Jackson has said the United States could reduce its troop strength in Western Europe. The Middle East
In the Middle East, Mr. Hart and Mr. Mondale have both been strong supporters of Israel. Mr. Mondale has had more opportunity to demonstrate his commitment, but American Jewish leaders see little to criticize in Mr. Hart's record.
Mr. Jackson says Israel ''must recognize the Palestinians have a right to self-determination or a homeland,'' just as he says the Palestine Liberation Organization should recognize Israel's right to exist. Unlike the other candidates, he has supported creation of ''an independent Palestinian state on the West Bank and Gaza.'' The United States, he says, could be a much more effective mediator in the Middle East if it were willing to talk to the P.L.O.
Mr. Hart voted against President Carter's decision to sell F-15 jet fighters to Saudi Arabia in 1978 and voted against President Reagan's proposal to sell Awacs radar planes to the Saudis in 1981. Mr. Mondale, as Vice President, lobbied for the F-15 sale but he now says he privately opposed it at the time. Many supporters of Israel opposed the F-15 sale on the ground that it threatened that nation's security.
Mr. Mondale has said he strongly favors moving the United States Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Israel has regarded Jerusalem as its capital since 1949, but the United States has kept its embassy in Tel Aviv on the ground that the final status of Jerusalem should be decided through negotiations.
Mr. Hart says he supports moving the embassy although his position ''evolved'' over time. Mr. Hart declined to co-sponsor a bill that would require relocation of the embassy. In a letter last February to an official of a Zionist group, Mr. Hart said the status of Jerusalem could be resolved only through ''negotiations involving all sides.'' Mr. Hart later disavowed the letter, saying it was prepared by his staff and did not reflect his views.
In a statement issued March 16, Mr. Hart said, ''If elected President, I would move the U.S. Embassy to West Jerusalem,'' and he has reaffirmed that position since then.
Military Spending
Mr. Mondale says he would allow military spending to increase at a rate of 4 to 5 percent a year, after making up for the effects of inflation. That is substantially less than the 13 percent increase in military appropriations, including an inflation catchup, that Mr. Reagan sought in the budget sent to Congress last February.
In an interview last December, Mr. Hart said he wanted to see military spending rise at an annual rate of 4.5 to 5 percent, including the inflation catchup. But in February, when he released a comprehensive budget plan, he said the nation could meet its ''true national security needs'' with an increase of 3 percent a year, after accounting for inflation, and this is the figure he now recommends.
In Congress, as a leader of the bipartisan ''military reform'' movement, Mr. Hart has said the Pentagon should spend more on manpower and combat readiness and less on procurement of expensive, complex weapons. He has recommended less emphasis on heavy firepower and more reliance on rapid surprise maneuvers to disrupt the organization of enemy forces.
Mr. Jackson says there should be ''zero real growth'' in the military budget in the next five years.
All three oppose proposals for an MX intercontinental missile, a B-1 bomber, new nuclear-powered aircraft carriers and poison nerve gas.
Nuclear Weaponry
All three candidates support a freeze on the testing, production and further deployment of nuclear warheads, missiles and other delivery systems.
Advocates of arms control give high marks to Mr. Mondale and Mr. Hart. David Cortright, executive director of the Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy, a private nonprofit group, said that on this issue ''the differences between Hart and Mondale are very slight or insignificant.''
Mr. Hart did not co-sponsor a resolution supporting the freeze when it was first introduced in March 1982. Mr. Hart issued a statement saying the pursuit of numerical limits, though a ''valid objective,'' was not enough. He offered his own proposal calling for negotiations with the Soviet Union to prevent the use of nuclear weapons, to reduce the danger of nuclear war through accident or miscalculation and to prevent nuclear terrorism.
Mr. Hart did co-sponsor a freeze resolution in the next Congress in January 1983. He also supported a proposal calling for the destruction of two nuclear weapons systems whenever a new one was built. Mr. Mondale opposed this proposal, asserting it was inconsistent with the freeze.
However, Mr. Hart argued that there was no fundamental contradiction. He said the United States could follow such a policy while trying to negotiate a freeze.
Busing for Desegregation
In 1970, Mr. Mondale introduced a resolution to create a Select Committee on Equal Educational Opportunity, a basically liberal panel that served as a counterweight to the more conservative Judiciary Committee. Mr. Mondale became chairman of the select committee, held hearings and led Senate opposition to President Nixon's proposals to limit the use of busing for school desegregation.
''Busing is the means - and at times the only means - by which segregation in public schools can be reduced,'' Mr. Mondale said in a Senate speech in 1972.
Mr. Jackson and Mr. Hart have also opposed efforts to prevent the use of busing as a means of school desegregation.
Affirmative Action
As Vice President, Mr. Mondale urged the Justice Department to make a strong defense of affirmative action in the case of Allan P. Bakke, a white who challenged a special admissions program at the medical school of the University of California at Davis.
In response to a questionnaire from Mayor Koch of New York City, Mr. Mondale said: ''I strongly support affirmative action to correct past discrimination. I reject the use of quotas.''
Mr. Hart said: ''I support quotas, as an alternative to so-called 'weaker' forms of affirmative action, if the use of such a remedy is necessary to remedy the effects of past discrimination.'' Mr. Hart listed criteria he would use in evaluating the need for quotas.
Mr. Jackson says that numerical goals and quotas may sometimes be necessary to eradicate the effects of 200 years of discrimination.
Civil Rights
All the candidates say they have been champions of civil rights, and all denounce the policies of the Reagan Administration.
Mr. Jackson has spent all his adult life in civil rights work, starting in the early 1960's, when he led sit-ins and protest marches to desegregate theaters and restaurants in Greensboro, N.C. He has continued that work in the last decade as president of Operation PUSH, a civil rights organization based in Chicago. One of his major campaign promises is tougher enforcement of the Voting Rights Act.
As a Senator, Mr. Mondale was more prominent in civil rights battles than Mr. Hart has been. Mr. Mondale was a leader of the bipartisan liberal bloc that won passage of the Fair Housing Act of 1968, which prohibited certain forms of discrimination in the sale or rental of about two-thirds of the nation's housing.
In 1975, Mr. Mondale led efforts to change Senate rules so it would be easier to end filibusters, which had often been used to block action on civil rights bills.
Senator Hart has supported extension of the Voting Rights Act, sponsored a resolution to deny tax exemptions to private schools that discriminate on the basis of race and opposed President Reagan's efforts to abolish the Legal Services Corporation. Right to Abortion Backed
All three candidates support the proposed amendment to the Constitution to guarantee equal rights for women. All support the right of women to choose abortion and oppose efforts to restrict access to abortion.
All the candidates support legislation to guarantee that women receive the same pay as men if they perform work of comparable value. This principle of pay equity goes beyond the requirements of a 1963 Federal law that requires equal pay for identical work. Mr. Hart has proposed legislation to forbid economic discrimination against women.
All three candidates support Federal legislation to forbid discrimination against homosexuals. All say they would issue an executive order banning discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in Federal employment.
Mr. Mondale says he has not decided whether the ban should apply to the armed forces. Mr. Jackson says there is ''no reasonable basis'' for excluding homosexuals from the military. Mr. Hart says ''military employment should not be restricted because of sexual orientation per se.''
Industrial Policy
Mr. Hart and Mr. Mondale both favor more cooperation by business, labor and the Government to revitalize basic industries. Mr. Hart has been identified as a proponent of having a formal strategy to assist ailing industries. But Mr. Mondale also supports ''a coherent industrial strategy,'' including more investment in job training and education.
Mr. Hart says he would try to negotiate ''industrial modernization and growth agreements.'' Under such compacts, he says, labor unions would defer wage demands or make them contingent on improvements in productivity or profitability. In exchange, employers would guarantee jobs for a specified period and help retrain employees.
Mr. Hart says Congress should authorize individual training accounts. Employers and employees could each make tax-deductible contributions to such accounts, and if workers lost their jobs, they could withdraw money to pay for retraining or further education.
All three candidates support an increase in public works and highway programs, which they see as a major source of new jobs.
Mr. Hart's economic policy appears to rely more heavily on financial incentives to change behavior and less on direct Government subsidies to troubled industries. As Vice President, Mr. Mondale strongly supported the Carter Administration's proposal to provide Federal loan guarantees to the Chrysler Corporation in 1979. In retrospect, supporters of the bill say it saved the jobs of hundreds of thousands of automobile workers. Mr. Hart voted against the bill because, he said, it contradicted ''the basic tenets of free enterprise'' and increased ''Government interference in the marketplace.''
Mr. Mondale strongly supports another bill designed to protect the jobs of American auto workers. The bill would require the use of specified quantities of American parts and labor in imported automobiles. It would, in effect, require foreign car makers to set up factories in the United States if they sold more than 100,000 cars a year here.
Mr. Hart opposes the bill, saying it would not make the American auto industry any more competitive and might provoke Japanese retaliation against America's agricultural exports. Mr. Jackson does not support the bill, either.
Mr. Mondale has made trade policy a central theme of his campaign. In a speech to the A.F.L.-C.I.O. last October, he said, ''I will match other countries' export subsidies product for product and dollar for dollar.''
Mr. Mondale says he does not seek a permanent increase in trade barriers. By adopting a more aggressive trade policy, he says, the United States can persuade other countries to reduce their export subsidies.
Mr. Jackson would establish ''a noncoercive national economic planning body'' to help channel investments and allocate resources. Such planning, he says, could match training with job opportunities and reduce ''the need for protectionist policies and other forms of corporate bailout.''
Budget Deficits
The Democratic candidates all charge that President Reagan is responsible for the biggest deficits in the nation's history because he has cut income tax rates across the board while rapidly increasing the military budget.
A statement issued by Mr. Mondale's office said, ''At the end of his first term, he would cut the Reagan deficits by more than half.'' Mr. Hart says he could reduce the deficit to $78.5 billion in the fiscal year 1989. That is less than one-third of the $248 billion deficit that the Congressional Budget Office anticipates for that year under Mr. Reagan's policies.
The Mondale and Hart proposals are mere sketches. Neither has anything like the amount of detail that Congress and the President require when they take action on the budget.
The Congressional Budget Office says that the Reagan program, if continued, would lead to Federal outlays of more than $1,200 billion in 1989. Mr. Mondale said his proposals would save these amounts in the 1989 budget: $30 billion to $40 billion in the military; $15 billion in health programs, mainly Medicare, the health insurance program for the elderly; $10 billion in agriculture programs, and $15 billion to $20 billion in interest on the Federal debt. In addition, Mr. Mondale said his tax proposals would generate ''at least $60 billion'' in additional revenue in 1989.
Mr. Mondale said he would spend $30 billion more than the Reagan Administration expects to spend for education, research and development, job training, industrial strategy, export subsidies, nutrition programs, legal services and environmental protection in 1989. Taken together, the proposed budget and tax changes would, according to Mr. Mondale, reduce the deficit by ''more than $100 billion in 1989.'' Hart Would Trim $170 Billion
Mr. Hart said his proposal for 1989, compared with the Reagan budget for the same year, would save these amounts: $44 billion in the military; $3.5 billion in Medicare; $55 billion in interest on the Federal debt, and $1 billion in subsidies for nuclear power and synthetic fuels. Mr. Hart said his tax proposals would generate $90 billion of additional revenue in 1989. But he would spend $20 billion more than the Reagan Administration expects to spend for education, job training, child nutrition, legal services and public works.
Taken together, these proposals, according to Mr. Hart, would reduce the deficit by roughly $170 billion in 1989.
Mr. Jackson proposes deeper cuts in the military budget than the other two, but larger increases in domestic spending, so the net reduction in the deficit, $70 billion, would be smaller than under his rivals' proposals. Mr. Jackson said he could reduce the military budget by $80 billion in the fiscal year 1985, which begins Oct. 1. About $60 billion, he said, could be saved by requiring the European allies, Japan and South Korea to pay defense costs now borne by the United States. The other $20 billion, he said, would come from cutbacks in weapon programs.
Mr. Jackson said his tax proposals would raise $50 billion of additional revenue. He would spend $10 billion for ''restoration of a portion of the safety net'' for poor people and would increase spending on public works by $50 billion.
Tax Increases
All three candidates say they would raise taxes. Such statements are an unusual act of candor for Presidential candidates, reflecting the depth of their concern about the deficit.
Mr. Hart proposes a 10 percent surcharge on corporate income taxes. Mr. Hart also proposes heavier taxation of corporate income derived from foreign sources and a longer depreciation period for buildings. These proposals would generate $35 billion of additional revenue in 1989, he says.
Mr. Mondale has proposed a ''corporate minimum tax,'' amounting to 15 percent of a company's taxable income. Mr. Mondale says his corporate tax proposals would raise $21 billion in 1989.
Both candidates would raise individual taxes as well. They would defer the effective date of a law linking individual income tax brackets to inflation. This device, known to specialist as indexing, is scheduled to take effect next year. At present, taxpayers whose wages rise with inflation are pushed into higher and higher tax brackets. The purpose of indexing is to eliminate the additional tax burden caused by inflation. Mr. Hart and Mr. Mondale now say the Government cannot do without the revenue that would be lost through indexing in the next few years.
Mr. Hart and Mr. Mondale would also limit the final installment of the three-year tax cut approved in 1981 at President Reagan's behest. Mr. Mondale would limit the value of the tax cut for people with incomes exceeding $60,000 a year. Mr. Hart would ''cap the benefits'' for anyone with income of more than $50,000 a year.
All the candidates would ask Congress to impose a heavier tax burden on more affluent taxpayers. Mr. Mondale has proposed a 10 percent surtax on incomes above $100,000 a year. Mr. Hart would impose a 5 percent surtax on incomes exceeding $100,000 for couples and $70,000 for individuals. Mr. Jackson would impose a temporary graduated surtax on incomes over $25,000. The rate would range from 1 percent to 10 percent, with people in higher income brackets subject to the higher rates.
Mr. Hart was a co-sponsor of the comprehensive tax simplification bill offered last year by Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey and Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, both Democrats. The bill would reduce the top rate for the individual income tax, now 50 percent, to 30 percent, while repealing most itemized deductions. Mr. Mondale says the Bradley-Gephardt bill ''rests on sound principles.''
Civil Rights
All the candidates say they have been champions of civil rights, and all denounce the policies of the Reagan Administration.
Mr. Jackson has spent all his adult life in civil rights work, starting in the early 1960's, when he led sit-ins and protest marches to desegregate theaters and restaurants in Greensboro, N.C. He has continued that work in the last decade as president of Operation PUSH, a civil rights organization based in Chicago. One of his major campaign promises is tougher enforcement of the Voting Rights Act.
As a Senator, Mr. Mondale was more prominent in civil rights battles than Mr. Hart has been. Mr. Mondale was a leader of the bipartisan liberal bloc that won passage of the Fair Housing Act of 1968, which prohibited certain forms of discrimination in the sale or rental of about two-thirds of the nation's housing.
In 1975, Mr. Mondale led efforts to change Senate rules so it would be easier to end filibusters, which had often been used to block action on civil rights bills.
Senator Hart has supported extension of the Voting Rights Act, sponsored a resolution to deny tax exemptions to private schools that discriminate on the basis of race and opposed President Reagan's efforts to abolish the Legal Services Corporation. Right to Abortion Backed
All three candidates support the proposed amendment to the Constitution to guarantee equal rights for women. All support the right of women to choose abortion and oppose efforts to restrict access to abortion.
Mr. Jackson said, ''As a private matter, I would not, except in medically extenuating circumstances, advise a woman to have an abortion.'' He emphasizes that a woman who chooses to have an abortion must ''be responsible and live with the consequences'' of such a choice.
All the candidates support legislation to guarantee that women receive the same pay as men if they perform work of comparable value. This principle of pay equity goes beyond the requirements of a 1963 Federal law that requires equal pay for identical work. Mr. Hart has proposed legislation to forbid economic discrimination against women.
All three candidates support Federal legislation to forbid discrimination against homosexuals. All say they would issue an executive order banning discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in Federal employment.
Mr. Mondale says he has not decided whether the ban should apply to the armed forces. Mr. Jackson says there is ''no reasonable basis'' for excluding homosexuals from the military. Mr. Hart says ''military employment should not be restricted because of sexual orientation per se.''
Busing for Desegregation
In 1970, Mr. Mondale introduced a resolution to create a Select Committee on Equal Educational Opportunity, a basically liberal panel that served as a counterweight to the more conservative Judiciary Committee. Mr. Mondale became chairman of the select committee, held hearings and led Senate opposition to President Nixon's proposals to limit the use of busing for school desegregation.
''Busing is the means - and at times the only means - by which segregation in public schools can be reduced,'' Mr. Mondale said in a Senate speech in 1972.
Mr. Jackson and Mr. Hart have also opposed efforts to prevent the use of busing as a means of school desegregation.
Affirmative Action
As Vice President, Mr. Mondale urged the Justice Department to make a strong defense of affirmative action in the case of Allan P. Bakke, a white who challenged a special admissions program at the medical school of the University of California at Davis.
In response to a questionnaire from Mayor Koch of New York City, Mr. Mondale said: ''I strongly support affirmative action to correct past discrimination. I reject the use of quotas.''
Mr. Hart said: ''I support quotas, as an alternative to so-called 'weaker' forms of affirmative action, if the use of such a remedy is necessary to remedy the effects of past discrimination.'' Mr. Hart listed criteria he would use in evaluating the need for quotas.
Mr. Jackson says that numerical goals and quotas may sometimes be necessary to eradicate the effects of 200 years of discrimination.
Gun Control
Mr. Mondale advocates a ban on small handguns known as Saturday night specials. Mr. Hart said Wednesday in New York that he has ''opposed Federal gun control laws.'' However, he had previously expressed support for a ''cooling off period'' between the time a person buys such a gun and the time it can be taken home. This requirement, he says, would permit the authorities to check whether the purchaser had a criminal record. In a letter to a constituent, Mr. Hart said he supported ''the right of law-abiding citizens to enjoy the legitimate uses of firearms,'' and he said he would ''oppose any infringement of that right.''
Mr. Jackson advocates stiffer, more comprehensive gun controls than the other candidates. He favors licensing of handgun owners, a freeze on the manufacture and importation of handguns, and a ban on the sale and possession of such weapons.
Other Issues
All the candidates are against proposed constitutional amendments that would permit organized prayer in public schools.
All oppose a comprehensive immigration bill proposed by Senator Alan K. Simpson, Republican of Wyoming, and Representative Romano L. Mazzoli, Democrat of Kentucky. The bill would require job applicants to show they were citizens or legal aliens and would prohibit the hiring of those in this country illegally. The candidates say this could increase discrimination against Hispanic people.

Abstract: ''We are optimistic,'' said Robert Wescott of Wharton Econometrics, an economic consulting firm. He predicts a 5 percent inflation rate for 1984, with small wage increases and high productivity holding overall prices down despite a drought-induced rise in some food prices. The Bureau of Labor Statistics said the September index was pushed up partly by prices in grocery stores, reflecting the impact of the drought on fruits, vegetables and poultry. Rising housing costs, especially for heating fuel and electricity, also added upward pressure. But unchanged college tuition prices helped moderate the overall increase for September, which followed increases of four- tenths of 1 percent in both July and August. ''The forecast of significantly higher inflation in 1984 is far from the consensus and quite unpopular in the investment community,'' said Mr. [Lawrence A. Kudlow] in a new inflation analysis. ''Proponents of this view cannot even fill up a phone booth. ''Yet both the monetary and the nonmonetary evidence point in the direction of accelerating inflation. But that's not all. If inflation is expected to rise, interest rates will head in the same direction.''

Full text: The Consumer Price Index, pushed up by rising car prices and housing costs, rose five-tenths of 1 percent in September, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today.
The increase continued a recent modest acceleration of inflation that is consistent with most analysts' expectations. This is one reason many forecasters are predicting price rises of 5 percent to 6 percent next year, compared with 4 percent or so for 1983.
Larry Speakes, White House spokesman, said the September increase was moderate but was a reminder that ''keeping inflation under control requires constant vigilence.''
Consumer prices increased more sharply last month in the New York- Northeastern New Jersey area, where the rise was nine-tenths of 1 percent, than for the nation as a whole. (Page D8.)
The Outlook for Inflation
''We are optimistic,'' said Robert Wescott of Wharton Econometrics, an economic consulting firm. He predicts a 5 percent inflation rate for 1984, with small wage increases and high productivity holding overall prices down despite a drought-induced rise in some food prices. The Bureau of Labor Statistics said the September index was pushed up partly by prices in grocery stores, reflecting the impact of the drought on fruits, vegetables and poultry. Rising housing costs, especially for heating fuel and electricity, also added upward pressure. But unchanged college tuition prices helped moderate the overall increase for September, which followed increases of four- tenths of 1 percent in both July and August.
During the first nine months of this year the Consumer Price Index has risen at an annual rate of 3.7 percent. In the last 12 months the index rose 2.9 percent.
Gasoline and Housing Change
For the last six months, however, the index has risen at a rate of 5.3 percent, as gasoline prices and housing costs, which had kept inflation near zero for the first six months, stopped declining and began to rise.
A 5 percent pace is a big improvement from the double-digit inflation rates of 1979 and 1980.
Alan Greenspan, the economist and an outside adviser to the Reagan Administration, said he expects inflation to be slightly higher next year. He said business would push prices higher in an effort to expand profits after the recession.
A few economists depart from the consensus forecast and predict that the strong recovery and other factors will push inflation closer to 7 percent in 1984, which these forecasters say would put upward pressure on interest rates.
Lawrence A. Kudlow, who was the top economist in the Office of Management in 1981-82 and is now a consultant, predicts inflation of 6 percent to 7 percent next year.
Commodity Price Rises Noted
This, he says, ''is the surprise story in the works for 1984.''
In making his forecast, Mr. Kudlow cites rises in commodity prices, the overall increase in money growth last year and some indexes of future inflation.
''The forecast of significantly higher inflation in 1984 is far from the consensus and quite unpopular in the investment community,'' said Mr. Kudlow in a new inflation analysis. ''Proponents of this view cannot even fill up a phone booth.
''Yet both the monetary and the nonmonetary evidence point in the direction of accelerating inflation. But that's not all. If inflation is expected to rise, interest rates will head in the same direction.''
Prices of both new and used cars rose in September, with new cars up 1 percent and used cars up 2.1 percent. The advance in new car prices reflects the introduction of the 1984 models, which the Bureau of Labor Statistics said were included in the September data, a month earlier than usual.
Prices Affected by Drought
In addition, the price increase reflects the low level of cars in dealers' inventories, which has led to fewer rebate programs.
Grocery store prices were up two- tenths of 1 percent in September, following no change in August. Prices for fresh vegetables, which were damaged by the summer drought, were up 5.3 percent. Poultry prices were up 1.9 percent, also a result of the summer heat, which killed many chickens.
But this rise was moderated by a nine-tenths of 1 percent drop in beef and veal prices and a five-tenths of 1 percent drop in pork prices. These declines were also a result of the drought. Producers slaughtered their beef and pork at faster rates to avoid paying higher corn prices resulting from severe damamge to the corn crop. But this accelerated rate of slaughter is expected to push meat prices higher next year, when supplies will be lower.
Rise for Housing Component
Home heating fuel prices rose 2.2 percent, and electricity was up 1.3 percent. The cost of home ownership, which is based on the assumed cost of renting the home, rose five-tenths of 1 percent. Overall the housing component of the Consumer Price Index was up five-tenths of 1 percent, following a two-tenths of 1 percent increase in August.
The main surprise of the month was college tuition costs, which were unchanged, after seasonal adjustment. On an unadjusted basis, tuition was up 7.6 percent, but this translated to zero when adjusted for seasonal factors.
All the figures are seasonally adjusted, which keeps the index from bouncing around because of normal seasonal changes.
The five-tenths of 1 percent increase for September would translate to a compound annual rate of 5.7 percent if it continued for 12 months.

Full text: Economic Analysis
The world economy today, as it enters a second decade of coping with much more costly energy, can expect an uneven recovery, with the United States moving ahead more briskly than its industrial partners or the countries of the third world. And the enormous debts that oil-importing nations have piled up jeopardize the world's financial security.
But the world has indeed coped with the tumult of the 1970's, although it is gripped with a residue of broad structural unemployment, and the world's leaders have learned some important lessons.
The oil price explosion and the Arab oil embargo of 1973-74 dealt an unprecedented and lasting shock to the world economy - a shock that, paradoxically, brought both inflation and recession.
A worldwide economic slump ensued, in large measure a result of the efforts over the decade to fight the oil-induced inflation. The slump, in turn, led to an oil glut in the early 1980's, driving oil prices back down.
A Fivefold Increase
Nevertheless, the price of energy, adjusted for the inflation in other goods, is five times higher than a decade ago, according to World Bank estimates.
From the perspective of a decade, the legacies of the global transformation to the era of high energy costs are becoming clearer.
For one thing despite, or perhaps because of the pain, there has been a marked improvement in the efficiency with which energy is used.
Economists at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development calculate that from 1973 through 1982, United States industry improved its energy efficiency by 32.8 percent. For the non-Communist industrial nations as a group, the improvement was 31.1 percent. These gains will stretch the available supplies of oil decades into the future.
A second legacy appears to be a lessened dependence on the oil supplied by OPEC and priced by OPEC to reflect the dominance that the group once had in world oil trade. This dominance has been severely eroded by the expansion of oil production in Mexico, Alaska, the North Sea and other areas.
New View of Inflation
Another heritage seems to be a greater sensitivity of policy makers and electorates to inflation, and a greater willingness to tolerate high unemployment as the antidote. But George Perry of the Brookings Institution considers this perverse, and warns that it could ''tip the world toward scares of inflation'' and bias policies toward promoting only sluggish growth.
One of the most disturbing legacies is the enormous debt of the developing countries, incurred to finance their import needs but now so large as to endanger their financial stability and economic development. The danger persists that either political shocks, such as war in the Middle East, or economic shocks, such as a sharp run-up in interest rates, could break the world's financial structure.
The oil-poor developing countries are particularly vulnerable. But even some oil-producing countries, such as Mexico and Nigeria, are in financial trouble, as their imports have climbed above what they could pay for with oil exports. Burdens of Big Debts
The troubles of these nations could quickly become the economic and financial agonies of the developed countries, doubtless with political upheavals as well.
Prof. Gustav F. Papanek of Boston University says of the plight facing the poorest countries: ''For the rest of this century and into the early part of the next, only a small fraction of the labor force can find productive jobs in skilled export activities with low energy requirements.''
Another change is that throughout the world, industries that use less energy are displacing those that use more: Electronic communications substitute for transportation, services industries displace manufacturing. Effects Roll Through Industry
In forcing individuals, businesses and governments to economize on energy, the price explosion has led to what Mark Shepherd Jr., chairman of Texas Instruments Inc., calls ''a permanent downsizing'' of traditional industries.
The idling of factories that make steel and autos has in turn increased unemployment, bred trade protectionism and, in a pernicious cycle, cut deeply into demand for third world exports of such commodities as copper, jute, tin and iron ore.
In this rapidly changing industrial and post-industrial world, says Walter Salant, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, the premium will be on ''the more aggressive'' people and businesses, those that are most nimble at adapting to change.
The energy upheaval has also resulted in increased United States dominance of the world financial stage. The United States is the biggest recipient of capital flowing from oil-surplus countries and the biggest lender to the oil-poor debtors. High interest rates, due partly to the enormous rise in world debt, partly to the monetary policies adopted to check inflation, has strengthened the dollar but has weakened the United States trade position. The 'Watershed' of 1973
As James R. Schlesinger, a former Secretary of Energy and now a senior adviser to Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb Inc., put it at an energy conference in Stockholm last summer:
''From the standpoint of an economic historian, looking back to this era from the 21st century, the year 1973 will stand out as marking a watershed.'' The oil price explosion ''separated the postwar era of unparalleled economic expansion'' from the current one of ''unexpected economic difficulties.''
Thus the world has undergone a great transformation from the era of cheap energy that, in the quarter-century following World War II, helped to foster the most rapid industrialization and economic growth in history. This transformation has been painful.
Putting Earlier Inflation Into a Rapid Climb
But the price explosion was not what economists call exogenous, coming from outside the system. Global inflation had been set off in the mid-1960's by United States involvement in Vietnam. The heavy outflow of dollars to the rest of the world and the chronic deficit in the United States undermined the world monetary system, which was founded on the strength of the dollar.
Simultaneous boom in all the major countries during the early 1970's had nourished inflation. In early 1973, the Bretton Woods monetary system of fixed exchange rates collapsed; the dollar floated downward and the Japanese and West European currencies floated upward.
The disappearance of exchange- rate discipline gave another twist to the inflationary spiral: During the first 10 months of 1973, before the war in the Middle East, world commodity prices doubled.
But the oil price explosion set off by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries seriously worsened the situation.
Directly, it increased the costs of living by making it more expensive to drive cars, heat homes, pay electric bills and buy a host of goods and services in which hydrocarbons are used. It made it more costly for businesses to operate their plants, and for governments to do everything from lighting offices to delivering the mail.
Indirectly, the price increases induced a wage-price spiral as workers tried to keep up or catch up with rising living costs and employers sought to pass on their rising wage costs to consumers.
The Bankers Confront The Shift in Wealth
But the basic problems remained the higher relative cost of energy and the shift of wealth and income to the oil-producing countries.
In 1973, OPEC had a surplus of $13 billion in its current-account balance. By 1980, that figure had reached $115 billion. In that year, the corresponding deficits of the industrial countries reached $75 billion and the deficits of the non-oil developing countries were $58 billion.
To keep the global economy afloat, a vast recycling operation took place. The oil-producing countries invested their surplus funds in New York, London, Frankfurt and other financial centers. This produced a capital surplus in the industrial countries, which lent the petrodollars to the oil-importing countries.
The total outstanding debt of non- oil developing countries, which had been $130 billion in 1973, climbed to $664 billion in 1983. With some oil exporters and Eastern European nations piling on debts as well, the total debt of endangered countries swelled to more than $800 billion.
The danger of a financial collapse gave private bankers and public officials nightmares. Debt-service charges mounted, and the high interest rates choked off investment and economic expansion.
Planning a Response In Consumer Nations
Thus, how to break this cycle of inflation and debt came to dominate policy planning in the industrial nations.
Whether because of a conservative shift on the part of electorate, a shift that resulted in large part from inflation itself, or because government officials and economists had lost confidence in the efficacy of wage and price controls, Western governments chose to combat inflation only by general fiscal and monetary controls.
But the use of such general restraints caused growth to slow further and unemployment to rise.
Even in the absence of deliberate government actions, climbing oil prices have brought about an implicit change in fiscal and monetary policies, as economists at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development note in their current Economic Outlook. Effects of Changes in Policy
For instance, a given rate of growth in the money supply, sufficient to finance real economic growth with a low rate of inflation, was no longer adequate. Hence, real growth fell and, as markets for both goods and labor worsened, so did inflation.
Similarly, a given fiscal policy, whose degree of stimulus could be measured by the size of the deficit that would be incurred at high employment, would be less stimulative at high rates of inflation.
Thus many governments, including the United States, oscillated between policies to check inflation and, when these created recession, policies to combat unemployment.
Real economic growth in the industrial world, which had averaged 6.1 percent in 1973, fell to seven-tenths of 1 percent in 1974 and became negative in 1975. But that slump brought down inflation from 12.5 percent in 1974 to below 8 percent in 1976, where it stayed until the second oil shock of 1979-80.
In propelling inflation back up to the double-digit level, the second shock brought forth tougher monetary policies from the United States and most other major industrial countries. Interest rates shot up again, and the industrial countries as a group sank to their lowest levels of output - and highest levels of unemployment - since the Depression.
The United States and the other industrial countries are once again recovering from the harsh monetary measures taken to combat inflation. Consumption is reviving but investment, hobbled by excess capacity and by still relatively high interest rates, continues to lag. Lingering Puzzles
The decade has also left economists with some puzzles.
One of the most difficult factors to explain has been the slow rate of growth in productivity. In the United States, output per man-hour rose more than 3.3 percent a year from 1947 through 1973. But this slumped to 1 percent for 1973-78 and four-tenths of 1 percent for 1978-81.
Among the possible reasons for this are the substitution of relatively cheaper labor for machinery that uses energy, or the stunting of real investment, or the overall recession.
One of the biggest mysteries is the decline in the efficiency of capital investment itself in the last decade. In a study, ''World Economic Development and the Energy Factor,'' being published this autumn by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and ASEA, the Swedish electrical company, Mr. Shepherd, of Texas Instruments, emphasizes that extra dollars of investment have been producing less additional real G.N.P.
In the 1950's, he notes, an increase in the investment/G.N.P. ratio of one percentage point increased the G.N.P. growth rate by half a point; by the early 1980's, this had fallen to a dismal 0.17 percentage point.
The adjustment process begun in 1973 is by no means over, and adjustment via recession and high unemployment has been both painful and risky. But the industrial world has considered the alternative - which is collapse - and has decisively rejected it.

Abstract: To make our measures of Government deficits more meaningful in a period of inflation, we must adjust for the ''inflation tax'' that the Government collects from the public in the form of depreciation in the real value of Government liabilities - what the Government ''owes'' us is worth less. As shown in figures that I prepared with Professor [Paul J. Pieper] for the 1982 Economic Report of the President, such a ''revaluation'' of net Government debt turned a 1980 deficit of $61 billion - in the National Income Accounts - to a surplus of $7 billion. Large projected Federal deficits some years from now, with inflation down, are quite another matter. The lower ''inflation tax'' means that the properly adjusted budget turned particularly stimulatory in 1982, and the emerging recovery is hardly unrelated to this stimulus. Huge deficits in post-recovery years, however, could well put the economy through a new inflation wringer.

Full text: INFLATION plays all kinds of tricks, and not the least of them on Federal budgets. The tricks have greatly confused public discussion of budget deficits, past, present and future.
In ordinary accounting one may think of a budget deficit as adding to outstanding debt. Thus, if at the end of 1982 the Federal Government were to have a debt of $1,200 billion, a 1983 deficit of $200 billion should be expected to raise the debt to $1,400 billion at the end of 1983.
Economists see such an increase in debt, other things being equal - and contrary to many public views - as essentially stimulatory. The presumed reason is that, paradoxically, the debt of the Government is an asset to private individuals. The greater the Government debt, the more we all own in Government bonds and, other things being equal, the wealthier we are likely to feel. Hence, the more we will be ready to spend.
Of course, when deficits occur and the debt goes up, other things are not generally equal. If a deficit stems essentially from recession-induced decreases in tax revenues and increases in expenditures for unemployment benefits, the stimulus of the deficit is only a minor, although not unimportant, counterbalance to the slump itself.
But, first of all, Government deficits need not add up to net increases in private assets. In a forthcoming paper in the American Economic Review, Paul J. Pieper of the University of Illinois-Chicago and I note that while the Federal Government reported deficits totaling no less than $336 billion from 1947 to 1980, the market value of net Federal debt over that period grew by only $222 billion.
This relates in part to the fact that Federal deficits are considerably financed by increased holdings of debt by the Federal Reserve and various Government-related agencies and trust funds, rather than by the public.
And secondly, the market value of private holdings of Federal debt is affected by prevailing interest rates. As inflation and tight monetary policy, until recently, drove interest rates sky-high, bond prices fell, and with them the market value of Federal debt. Yet that is only a small part of the story. Inflation further reduces the real value of outstanding Government debt.
THUS, over that same post-World War II period, while budget deficits totaled $336 billion, the real market value of the debt, in 1972 dollars, went down by $231 billion. Perhaps astonishingly to some, with all these years of deficits from 1946 on, the real net debt per capita fell by some two-thirds, from $3,384 in 1972 dollars at the end of 1946 to $1,078 by the end of 1980.
All this gives us a sharply different perspective on recent and current budget deficits. Budget deficits, remember, are considered stimulatory because private holdings of the new debt put out to finance the deficits give the public a feeling of greater wealth, which brings on more private spending.
But if inflation and higher interest rates leave the public poorer in its real holdings of Government debt, we can hardly view the deficits as stimulatory at all, let alone overstimulatory.
To make our measures of Government deficits more meaningful in a period of inflation, we must adjust for the ''inflation tax'' that the Government collects from the public in the form of depreciation in the real value of Government liabilities - what the Government ''owes'' us is worth less. As shown in figures that I prepared with Professor Pieper for the 1982 Economic Report of the President, such a ''revaluation'' of net Government debt turned a 1980 deficit of $61 billion - in the National Income Accounts - to a surplus of $7 billion.
It has been widely perceived that tight monetary policy contributed significantly to our severe recession. Tight money has been supported by many and tolerated by others in the view that it was necessary to correct what they perceived as an overstimulative fiscal policy. But Federal budget policy, as evaluated with appropriate corrections for inflation, was in fact not stimulatory but restrictive from 1977 to the middle of 1982.
It was hence very likely a near-lethal combination of tight monetary and fiscal policies that contributed to the recession and brought the unemployment count to 12 million.
Large projected Federal deficits some years from now, with inflation down, are quite another matter. The lower ''inflation tax'' means that the properly adjusted budget turned particularly stimulatory in 1982, and the emerging recovery is hardly unrelated to this stimulus. Huge deficits in post-recovery years, however, could well put the economy through a new inflation wringer.
Understanding the real measure and impact of budget deficits will help us see how we got into economic decline. It should also help clarify the policies to get us out of it and avoid new problems in the future.

Full text: The ninth economic summit conference is being convened in Williamsburg, Va., this weekend in an atmosphere strikingly different from that in which the previous eight sessions were held.
For the first time since the meetings began in 1975, inflation is not viewed as a significant problem. And the price of energy, rather than rising, has been falling.
The deep recession of the past two years lingers, but there are hopeful signs that economic growth is reviving, at least in the United States, West Germany, Britain and Japan.
There is even basic agreement among the seven participants about the need to provide assistance to the developing countries, especially heavily indebted third-world nations.
The Longer-Term Problems
But a look back at the earlier conferences indicates that the seven nations will have difficulty in coming to grips with their fundamental long-term problems. This meeting, like most of its predecessors, is likely to focus on immediate issues, often reflecting the day-to-day political problems of the participants.
''Since 1975, we have been whipsawed from one crisis to another, and that is unlikely to change,'' said Jay N. Woodworth, vice president of the Bankers Trust Company.
Yet, although there have been no major breakthroughs, it is generally agreed that the meetings are useful. Anthony M. Solomon, for example, who is president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, says that the talks frequently have strengthened the resolve of the world leaders to avoid protectionist policies, and the ''heavy glare of media attention'' helps focus attention on major economic issues. Focus on Energy Issue
Although energy has been a common thread, the seven heads of government have avoided a direct confrontation with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
The meetings, in fact, were made possible only because the United States, under President Gerald R. Ford, gave in to French demands and abandoned its confrontational attitude toward OPEC. Only then did President Valery Giscard d'Estaing call the first conference, which was held in 1975 at Rambouillet, near Paris.
The concept underlying the meetings has been that there is a need for harmonization of economic policy among the major nations. At Ottawa and Versailles, however, President Reagan seemed to have taken a different view: that his first responsibility was to restore the United States economy to health. Over the long term, in this view, an economically healthy America would lead to an economically healthy world.
Mr. Reagan's attitude may be different at the Williamsburg meeting. Efforts have been made to eliminate tensions over such emotioncharged issues as East-West trade. There even seems to be a consensus on the need for more aid to developing countries, especially in Latin America.
Following are synopses of the previous economic summit conferences: Rambouillet, France Nov. 15-17, 1975
The first meeting was marked by a spirit of harmony. President Giscard d'Estaing and Chancellor Helmut Schmidt had had a close working relationship as finance ministers of France and Germany. And President Ford, trying to bring the United States out of the Watergate era, was eager to establish warm relations.
The similarities between the first meeting and the one this weekend are striking. Like today, recession was then the major concern of the participants, even though unemployment was half of today's level.
The first conference came during the worst business slump since the end of World War II, and there was widespread fear in Europe that a deepening recession could lead to political disruption and war.
The top priority at Rambouillet, thus, was economic recovery. But there were other themes. For example, France agreed to accept the concept of floating exchange rates. But it was agreed that governments would act to ''counter disorderly market conditions or erratic fluctuations in exchange rates.'' Eventually, however, France and the United States became deeply divided over the interpretation of this.
The participants also renewed their commitments to free trade and set 1977 as the date for completion of the so-called Tokyo Round of trade negotiations to reduce tariffs. Dorado Beach, P.R. June 27-28, 1976
With the American, German and French participants facing elections later in the year, there was a strong determination to duplicate the harmony of the 1975 conference. In fact, the meeting in Puerto Rico was dubbed Rambouillet II.
The theme was the need for sustained economic recovery without stimulating inflation. There was also agreement to consider new multinational credit facilities for countries suffering temporary payments problems, a plan aimed at helping Italy and some developing countries.
Little was said, at least publicly, about differences over exchange rate policies or export credits to Communist countries. London May 7-8, 1977
In a way, this meeting was a test of the new President, Jimmy Carter. On economic issues, the focus was on recovery, even though there were clear indications that the 1973-75 recession had ended. Mr. Carter was in an awkward position: Once an ardent advocate of expansionary economic policies, he had recently abandoned his plan for a tax rebate and, at the meeting, he sided with the Germans and Japanese, who favored a cautious approach to growth.
It was agreed that the United States would seek 5.8 percent annual growth, Japan 6.7 percent and Germany 5 percent. There were also agreements to increase aid to the third world. Bonn July 16-17, 1978
The highlight of this meeting was European criticism of the weak dollar, of high inflation in the United States and of the apparent lack of an energy policy in Washington. The United States, on the other hand, demanded that Germany and Japan stimulate their economies.
More than any other summit session, the Bonn meeting produced a clearly articulated set of goals, specifying economic growth rates for each nation. The United States also promised to reduce oil imports, to establish a strategic oil reserve and to increase coal production. Tokyo June 28-29, 1979
Just before the summit meeting opened, the seven participants were jolted by the ''second oil shock'' - a 50 percent rise in OPEC oil prices.
Thus, United States energy policy, or the lack of it, again dominated the meetings. President Carter acceded to European demands and pledged to place a ceiling on oil imports. In turn, the Europeans agreed to specific limits on oil imports.
It was also agreed that the United States would allow domestic oil prices to rise to international levels to induce the conservation of energy. Venice June 21-23, 1980
The atmosphere was tense, because of both economic and political factors. Relations were especially strained between President Carter and Chancellor Schmidt over policy toward the Soviet Union after the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan.
And, following the oil price increase the previous year, the seven nations shifted their first priority to fighting inflation, even though the world seemed to be entering a new period of recession. Ottawa July 20-22, 1981
This was President Reagan's first summit meeting, and he sought to keep a relatively low profile, determined to eliminate inflation in the United States even if that meant squeezing the European economies as well.
The Reagan Administration was far more eager to reach agreement on broad political issues. The President had been pressing the Europeans not to continue their support for the proposed Soviet gas pipeline to Western Europe, and for greater backing for United States policies in Central America and the Middle East.
Although Mr. Reagan did not accomplish much in terms of his political objectives, the announcement at the conclusion of the meeting reflected the conservative tone of American economic policies: expressions of support for reduced public borrowing, acceptance of the role of free markets, promotion of low and stable monetary growth and support for private as well as public capital for developing countries. Versailles, France June 5-6, 1982
In the grip of the worst economic slump since World War II, there were few signs that the global recession was approaching an end. Fears were growing that the recession would turn into a depression. Unemployment was expected to worsen. Inflation had slowly begun to decline, but underlying wage trends in France, Canada and Italy remained disturbingly high.
Just as this year, most participants were uncomfortable about large budget deficits in the United States and the relatively high level of American interest rates. But their criticisms were more muted then. And with the exception of France and Canada, which had been following expansionary monetary policies, the leaders agreed with Washington on giving first priority to reducing inflation.
But the Versailles meeting bogged down in matters that were more political than economic. President Reagan tried to get the other leaders to place more economic pressure on the Soviet Union, calling for curbs on subsidized export credits and an end to the construction of a natural gas pipeline from Siberia to Western Europe. The summit meeting ended in disarray. Economic Summit Meetings - At a Glance
Rambouillet, France, - The first time Presidents and prime ministers gathered for multilateral discussions of economic problems. The leaders rejected any return to fixed exchange rates, but agreed to counteract ''disorderly market conditions or erratic fluctuations in exchange rates.'' After the conference, however, there was sharp bickering among the countries about how far they were committed to individual action.
Dorado Beach, P.R. - Monetary cooperation took a back seat to the problem of reducing inflation. At issue was how to reduce unemployment without creating a new wave of inflation. There was also an agreement to explore the establishment of a multinational credit facility to help developing nations. World economic growth in the following year was minimal.
London - The first summit meeting for the Carter Administration marked the quick failure of the ''Locomotive Theory.'' President Carter's hope was to prompt rapid growth in the U.S., West Germany and Japan, which would act as a locomotive to pull the world economy to a recovery. Some expansionary steps were taken, but actual economic growth the following year fell below expectations.
Bonn - After much negotiating, the participants agreed to a diverse set of goals for each country. Germany agreed to a modest reflation, in return for U.S. efforts to reduce dependence on foreign oil and to bring down inflation. Canada and France agreed to stimulate their economies, while Britain and Italy concentrated on reducing inflation and Japan agreed to reduce exports. There was also broad agreement on the reduction of trade barriers.
Tokyo - Energy dominated the talks when the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries announced a 50 percent increase in oil prices the day before the meeting. France and the U.S. joined forces to urge a general reduction in oil imports through 1985, which was accepted. But the increased supply of oil that followed, combined with the recession, made the stringent import limits seem not very stringent.
Venice - Inflation was declared the ''immediate top priority.'' But energy remained the central issue, with a number of global policies agreed upon, including the development of alternative fuels. Nonetheless, specifics were lacking. Helmut Schmidt of Germany said later that much of the conference was taken up by political issues, not economics.
Ottawa - Many of the leaders were new - to their jobs and to each other. So this summit meeting, President Reagan's first, was a getacquainted session, and few decisions were made. There were also major divisions: While Britain and the United States, under new conservative administrations, sought low, steady growth rates in the money supply, France was headed into a new round of deficit spending. The summit meeting also represented the first time that all participants agreed to substantive North-South discussions, but they disagreed on the level of aid to less developed nations.
Versailles, France -This meeting returned to the issue that dominated the first: monetary stability. Also high on the agenda was the Reagan Administration's effort to encourage the use of economic sanctions against the Soviet Union for political leverage. Discussion in both areas yielded ambiguous results. Closer cooperation on currency fluctuations was promised, and a study of the need for formal government intervention in the currency markets was begun. But the participants later bickered bitterly over who was at fault for continuing monetary disorder.

Abstract: Mr. [Martin Feldstein]. That's last year's question. Last year other countries said, 'Be the locomotive.' And we explained that we weren't quite ready yet. But now we're not alone in expanding. We don't hear a call - at least I didn't, at the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development meetings (in Paris) - to expand more rapidly. The one thing they said over and over again was, 'Bring down your budget deficits so that we have a sustainable recovery and lower real interest rates.' Mr. Feldstein. At this point, we just couldn't operate a fixed rate system. If the French were to commit to having a fixed exchange rate relative to the dollar during the coming 12 months they would in effect be committing to bring down their inflation rate to ours. The French economy is hoping to have a 10 percent inflation rate this year. They couldn't force their economy to a point where it could generate a 4 percent inflation rate. The Italians couldn't bring theirs down. Now in the future it may be -Mr. [Robert A. Mundell]. It's a future policy.

Full text: The participants
Martin Feldstein is chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers. Robert A. Mundell is professor of economics at Columbia University. Rudy Oswald directs the Department of Economic Research, A.F.L.-C.I.O.
They talked with Edward Cowan, a reporter in the Washington bureau of The New York Times, Caroline Rand Herron, an editor of The Week in Review, and Peter T. Kilborn, an editor in The Times's Washington bureau. Question The industrial countries will hold an economic summit conference next weekend at Williamsburg, Va. In the United States, recovery has just begun after a deep recession. There is worry about third world debt, protectionism and currency reform. What should America's goals at Williamsburg be?
Mr. Oswald. In that list a very important item, unemployment, is left out. An economy is supposed to provide people with jobs and income; that's what an economy is all about. We have the highest unemployment since the Depression. The same is true of most of the other countries at Williamsburg. I would like the agenda to provide policies for full employment.
Mr. Mundell. The two important issues are coordinating world recovery - that's a short-run problem - and the longer-run problem of how that can be achieved without restoring inflation. Reform of the international monetary system is one of the key issues that should be brought up. We can get recovery with inflation, we believe, but we can't get recovery without inflation under the current exchange rate system.
Mr. Feldstein. There are important problems, of which the less developed countries' debt and the growing protectionist tendencies are probably the two most important. But Williamsburg comes at a time when the major countries are entering into recovery. So the spirit is likely to be positive and attention can focus on maintaining the gains on inflation, maintaining the recovery and facing the special problems of international trade and finance.
Q. Recovery in the United States will involve several years of unemployment of 8 percent or 9 percent. These are the Administration's policies and goals. Are they desirable or necessary?
Mr. Oswald. Neither. They leave nearly 10 million people unemployed and one out of five black people unemployed and deny hope to the young. We could grow much faster; we've grown faster coming out of other recessions. We just need the will to pursue faster growth.
Mr. Mundell. The short-run issue of how to accelerate the recovery is to have a further tax cut. The best part of Administration policies have been the Kemp-Roth tax cuts. (With another) cut of perhaps 10 percent in 1984 and 10 percent in 1985, an accommodating but not excessive monetary expansion and (return) to a stable exchange system with confidence built into the currencies again, inflationary expectations will not be revived and interest rates will come down to the levels of the 60's and 50's.
Mr. Feldstein. Now wait a minute. We don't have that world money system. We have to make do with what we have. That's why it's important for us not to increase the expansion at too rapid a rate. A further tax cut at this time would be the wrong medicine. It would enlarge the deficit and push up real interest rates.
Mr. Mundell. A tax cut during a recession is still the best way of achieving a good recovery. To plot high unemployment throughout the 80's is to fall into the mistake of the 30's, when it took from the high unemployment of 1933 almost 9 years to get even close to a fully employed economy. We only did that through the expenditure and monetary policies of a World War. We don't want to have to go through that process again.
Mr. Oswald. Except that I would achieve (recovery) through the fiscal side through more direct job creating programs that take care of providing people with jobs and meeting public needs. There is a substantial need for expansion of infrastructure - roads, sewers, schools, hospitals - as well as public services - whether that be day care centers or meals on wheels for the elderly.
Mr. Feldstein. There's a somewhat unrealistic sound to this discussion. None of us can disagree with the importance of bringing down unemployment. But the key is sustained recovery. It would be terrible if recovery were to overheat and come to a premature end. The last recovery began with an inflation rate near 6 percent in 1975 and got up to 12 percent to 13 percent in 1978-9. That got us into the mess we've been in the last couple of years. (And a sustainable recovery) means (getting) back to full employment and growing at that level thereafter - that you don't crash through a ceiling and then back down.
Mr. Oswald. Inflation concerns are a bugaboo when you are operating at 70 percent of capacity and 10 percent unemployment. The fact is, the elements of inflation can be dealt with separately without just creating high unemployment. Much of the inflation of the late 70's was the result of OPEC and sharply rising food prices, rather than overall tightness of the economy.
Q. Do you mean to suggest, Dr. Feldstein, that a slow recovery would bring an end to the business cycle?
Mr. Feldstein. I don't want to pretend or claim that there are not going to be shocks again that cause a temporary downturn. But we don't need to make those worse by mismanaged macropolicy.
Q In the third or fourth year of the recovery, will we see full employment in autos, steel, rubber, glass -especially with the hands-off, laissez-faire avoidance of industrial policy that this Administration practices?
Mr. Feldstein. If we continue to have large deficits we will have a lopsided recovery, in which interest-sensitive spending like construction and large consumer durable spending like autos is depressed and therefore steel and glass will not share fully. But if Congress agrees with the kind of deficit reductions we propose, then we can see long-term real interest rates come down and a more balanced recovery will help those industries.
Mr. Oswald. Bringing down deficits and therefore long-term interest rates won't guarantee recovery for particular industries. One needs particular policies to deal with the problems they face, if we want to maintain those industries in the American industrial mix. In any case, interest rates aren't solely determined by budget deficits. They are also determined by monetary policy and a variety of other factors. Just controlling interest rates isn't going to guarantee (overall) recovery.
Mr. Feldstein. But we now are hurting our export industries, like autos that compete with imports from abroad, and all the interestsensitive industries because of the out-year budget deficits.
Q. Surely the budget deficit is not responsible for Japanese cars and Asian steel.
Mr. Feldstein. It contributes. If the dollar hadn't risen about 35 percent in real terms in the last two and a half years relative to all other currencies then the United States steel and auto industries would be more competitive. And the primary reason why the dollar has gone up so much in the last couple of years has been very high real long-term interest rates, which reflect the budget deficit.
Q. Mr. Mundell, is the alternative to an activist industrial policy a more prudent fiscal policy?
Mr. Mundell. A sine qua non of getting recovery going quickly and getting deficits and unemployment down is further tax cuts. A great deal of research has gone into this. The Japanese miracle (of the 50's) was based on tax cuts every one, two or three years.
But the problem (today) is the high exchange rate and the balance of trade. The appreciation of the dollar has put the United States at a great disadvantage. And that's why it's not possible to talk only about one arm of policy. You have to talk about three - tax cuts, a stable monetary policy and international monetary reform.
Mr. Oswald. Fixed rates didn't lead to the overvaluation of the dollar in the 50's and 60's. There are other ways to deal with (that and) the trade impact - intervention in the exchange markets, limits on the flow of capital in and out and negotiating directly with Japan to readjust the relationship of the dollar and the yen.
Q Let's put the recovery in the international context. Should the United States strive to be the locomotive of industrial expansion for the rest of the world?
Mr. Oswald. The whole rest of the world should expand. Britain also has high unemployment, lots of excess capacity, low levels of inflation, and Germany as well.
Q. Does America have a special responsibilty?
Mr. Oswald. In terms of the size of our country, yes. But there's no reason why the others can't cooperate.
Mr. Feldstein. That's last year's question. Last year other countries said, 'Be the locomotive.' And we explained that we weren't quite ready yet. But now we're not alone in expanding. We don't hear a call - at least I didn't, at the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development meetings (in Paris) - to expand more rapidly. The one thing they said over and over again was, 'Bring down your budget deficits so that we have a sustainable recovery and lower real interest rates.'
Mr. Mundell. A dollar of demand anywhere in the OECD area has an effect on the OECD gross production. It all affects the global income. That's what the group discussion should be about. I don't believe in the locomotive theory, that it should be New York that pushes the recovery or California or Canada or the United States. All countries should push forward.
Q. Are the problems of the less developed countries essentially separate, or do the less developed countries rise and fall with the industrial countries?
Mr. Oswald. Our growth rate matters to them. But there are distinctions to be made. Some basic commodities are dependent upon demand in the United States. However, food products may not be affected by growth in developing countries. Nor does (faster growth here) guarantee internal development in developing countries.
Mr. Feldstein. One has to focus on the key problem that's unique this year, the debtor countries. We now have more than a dozen major countries that have International Monetary Fund programs dealing with (their) very large increases in debt. As Mr. Oswald said, our growth rates matter. If we don't maintain within the OECD growth rates of 2 1/2 percent to 3 percent in the next several years the estimates of the IMF are that those developing countries cannot pay off, or get on a regular basis for, dealing with their debt.
And indeed if we have an increase in inflation, the interest rates they pay will go up and that will pose more problems for them. So they have a big stake in our having solid and sustainable growth.And the other way around -the fact that they are contracting their imports to deal with their substantial balance-of-payments problems -has a big impact on us. (That) will cost the United States something like $15 billion in exports in the current year.
Mr. Oswald. (But) the IMF is in essence pursuing policies of no growth or of retarding growth in those countries, both in terms of what those countries do with their internal budget process and also in terms of asking them to curb imports and expand their exports. That has some deleterious effects both on the internal wellbeing of those countries - plus the effects of such policies on the developed countries themselves. In effect, our policies are promoting their problems and aggravating our own.
Mr. Feldstein. In the long term, they clearly have to turn around their economies, move towards more exports and we in the industrial countries have to be prepared to accept those increased exports.
Q. What about protectionism and the proposed domestic content legislation that would require that a substantial portion of foreign automobiles sold in this country consist of American-made parts?
Mr. Oswald. Domestic content in essense would provide for the continuation of the auto industry in the United States and establish the same basic ground rules that are used by most other auto producing countries either formally or informally. It is not a new protectionist device.
Mr. Feldstein. We have a potentially healthy auto industry. It has gone through some rough times but we're seeing substantial improvements in quality, in productivity. It would be a mistake to saddle the consumer with a much higher price for automobiles. It would add more than $1,000 to the typical automobile price to satisfy domestic content provisions.
Q. Was this what you meant when you said the United States would have to accept imports?
Mr. Feldstein. No, I was talking about the exports from the Mexico's, or Argentina or Brazil and we're not expecting to be importing cars from those places.
Mr. Oswald. But Mexico (has) a requirement for firms to locate there to sell and even export part of their production in the automobile industries. The effect is to take away job opportunties in this country.
Q. Let's get to international monetary reform.
Mr. Mundell. My formula for it would be movement to stabilize exchange rates by intervention in the foreign exchange markets and let that be the monetary rule that countries follow.
Q. Fixed exchange rates?
Mr. Mundell. Yes. If the French franc is depreciated, they'd have to sell foreign exchange and that would reduce the monetary base of the French economy. And that would be true for other small countries. Whereas the United States would take part in stabilizing the value of international reserves through intervention in the gold market, as it did under Bretton Woods.
Mr. Feldstein. At this point, we just couldn't operate a fixed rate system. If the French were to commit to having a fixed exchange rate relative to the dollar during the coming 12 months they would in effect be committing to bring down their inflation rate to ours. The French economy is hoping to have a 10 percent inflation rate this year. They couldn't force their economy to a point where it could generate a 4 percent inflation rate. The Italians couldn't bring theirs down. Now in the future it may be -Mr. Mundell. It's a future policy.

Abstract: Second, I will ask the Congress to adopt specific measures to control the growth of the so-called uncontrollable spending programs. These are the automatic spending programs, such as food stamps, that cannot be simply frozen - and that have grown by over 400 percent since 1970. They are the largest single cause of the built-in or ''structural'' deficit problem. Our standard here will be fairness - insuring that the taxpayers' hard-earned dollars go only to the truly needy; that none of them is turned away; but that fraud and waste are stamped out. And, I am sorry to say, there is a lot of it out there. In the food stamp program alone, last year we identified almost $1.1 billion in overpayments. The taxpayers are not the only victims of this kind of abuse; the truly needy suffer, as funds intended for them are taken by the greedy. For everyone's sake, we must put an end to such waste and corruption. Transportation - In the transportation area, my Administration has made major strides in implementing one of the fundamental principles in my program for economic recovery: having users pay for program costs that are clearly allocable to them. During the past year, I signed into law two Administration-backed proposals to increase excise taxes on aviation and highway users and thereby provide funding needed to revitalize and modernize these important segments of the nation's transportation system. The 1984 budget reflects the Administration's continued commitment to the ''users pay'' principle by again proposing user fees for: I remain adamantly opposed to temporary make-work public jobs or public works as an attempted cure for nonyouth unemployment. There are several reasons for this. The cost per ''job'' created is excessive; we cannot afford major new programs, particularly in our current budgetary straits; the actual number of new jobs ''created'' is minimal; the jobs created tend to be temporary and of a dead-end nature; and most such jobs do not materialize until after recovery is well under way. Improving The Efficiency Of Government

Full text: Following is the Budget Message that President Reagan sent to Congress today:
To the Congress of the United States: Two years ago, in my first address to the country, I went before the American people to report on the condition of our economy, which had suffered from many years of seriously misguided policies. I made a strong commitment to change the traditional short-sighted view that had previously been taken on economic priorities so that we could achieve our goal of long-term prosperity. I stated that we had a massive job before us.
Government spending was taking a rapidly increasing share of national income, burdensome Government regulation had stunted productivity increases, and excessive tax rates combined with erratic monetary policy resulted in serious disincentives to investment and long-term real economic growth. Inflation was at double-digit levels. Interest rates were at record highs. Real growth and job creation had ceased. New investment, productivity, and personal saving were stagnant. Our economy was in the worst mess in half a century.
To make matters worse, our military strength had been allowed to run down relative to the aggressively expanding military might of the Soviet Union. We were in serious danger of becoming powerless to deter or counter Soviet aggression around the world.
The economic program that I proposed at that time focused on longrange real growth. My tax proposals were signed to provide badly needed private incentives to stimulate saving and productive investment. I supported the Federal Reserve in its pursuit of sound monetary policy. I worked with the Congress to reverse the growth of Government programs that had become too large or outlasted their usefulness. I worked to eliminate or simplify unnecessary or burdensome regulations. Spending Up 21% Over '81
The unprecedented buildup of inflationary forces in the 1970's, however, exacerbated in severity and duration the economic downturn of recent years. One of the key detrimental forces has been the growing Federal budget. Despite our success in reducing the rate of growth of nondefense spending in the last two budgets, spending in 1983 will exceed 1981 levels by 21 percent, reflecting continued increases in basic entitlement programs, essential increases in defense spending, and rapid growth of interest costs.
Thus, the full effect of the changes we have made is taking time to develop. Overreactive short-term remedies are not the answer. What is essential now is that we continue to work together to rebuild this country - without losing sight of the four fundamentals of our economic program:
- Limiting tax burdens to the minimum levels necessary to finance essential Government services, thus maintaining incentives for saving, investment, work effort, productivity, and economic growth.
- Reducing the growth of overall Federal spending by eliminating Federal activities that overstep the proper sphere of Federal Government responsibilities and by restraining the growth of spending for other Federal activities.
- Reducing the Federal regulatory burden in areas where the Federal Government intrudes unnecessarily into our private lives or interferes unnecessarily with the efficient conduct of private business or of state or local government.
- Supporting a moderate and steady monetary policy, to bring inflation under control. Two Years Of Accomplishment
Over the past two years, dramatic improvements have been made in the way the Government affects our economy. The Congress joined with my Administration in a cooperative and politically courageous effort to reverse a decade of runaway growth in spending and tax burdens, proliferation of unnecessary regulations and red tape, and erosion of our military strength.
Both the Omnibus Reconciliation Acts of 1981 and 1982 effected fundamental reforms in numerous Federal programs, and demonstrated a greatly heightened level of maturity and responsibility of the Congressional budget process that has come to fruition with the help and support of this Administration. Although I am disappointed that many Administration spending-reduction proposals did not pass last year - which has resulted in higher deficits - I believe that the revitalized Congressional budget process signifies a refreshing willingness on the part of the Congress to work with my Administration to address squarely the many crucial, complex, and politically difficult budgetary dilemmas before us. The results have been impressive:
- Where the growth rate of spending was almost out of control at 17.4 percent a year in 1980, it is now declining dramatically - to 10.5 percent this year, and, with this budget, to 5.4 percent next year - which is no more than the projected rate of inflation; in effect, a comprehensive freeze on total Federal spending.
- Where spending growth totaled $220 billion from 1978 to 1981, a 48 percent increase, spending will rise by only 27 percent from 1981 to 1984, despite legislated cost-of-living adjustments and the needed defense buildup.

- For the first time since the Second World War, the Federal tax system has been fundamentally restructured. Income tax rates have been substantially reduced, greatly improving the climate for savings and investment. Excessive taxation of business income resulting from depreciation allowances rendered inadequate by inflation has been eliminated through depreciation reform. Tax loopholes have been closed, making the tax structure more equitable. Emphasis is shifting to financing programs through user fees commensurate with benefits and services provided.
- The excessive rates of growth of entitlement programs were curbed. Overly broad eligibility criteria were tightened to limit benefit awards more to the truly needy, and eliminate or restrict unnecessary and costly payments of welfare-type benefits to those who are relatively well off and are, or ought to be, self-supporting. Overly generous and unnecessarily frequent cost-of-living adjustments were pared back. Nonetheless, the growth of these programs has proven difficult to control and continues to be the primary cause of higher deficits.
- Limitation of Federal credit activity and off-budget spending is being achieved.
- The burgeoning growth of Federal regulations and red tape has been capped. The number of proposed new regulations has been reduced by one-third in the past two years. Unnecessary costs of Federal regulation to individuals, businesses, and state and local governments have been reduced by $6 billion in annual expenditures and $9 to $11 billion in capital costs. By the end of 1983, the time our citizens spend filling out Federal forms and reports will have been cut by over 300 million hours annually.
- Improvements in the management of Federal operations, such as better procedures for the collection of debts owed the Government and better cash-management practices, are being carried out. These improvements have helped reduce waste, fraud, and abuse in Government programs.
- And by the end of the 1982 fiscal year, the Federal nondefense workforce had been reduced by 91,300 employees since I took office. Outlines Actions on Military
During the past two years, we have also taken decisive measures to increase our military strength. At the same time, diplomatic approaches to increase our national security, such as arms reduction talks, have been vigorously pursued.
The improvement in our defense posture includes all of its major elements. Long-overdue modernization of our strategic forces is proceeding with new bomber, submarine and land-based missile programs. Our conventional forces are also being modernized and strengthened, with new ships, tanks, and aircraft. Above all, successful recruiting and retention over the past 18 months have resulted in all of our armed services being more fully manned with capable, high-caliber men and women. The All Volunteer Force is now working well.
By any standards, these are accomplishments to be proud of. And I am proud of them. We have come far in restoring order to the chaos prevailing in our economy and Government affairs just two years ago.
This is not to say that we do not still face great problems such as excessive unemployment, slower than desired economic growth, and high deficits. During the past two years our nation has labored to purge itself of the inflationary disease that for nearly two decades had progressively undermined the economy's ability to generate growth, capital formation, worker productivity incentives, and financial stability. Those inflationary fevers have largely subsided in the aftermath of my decision two years ago to redirect economic policy toward a more modest size and scope for the Federal Government, a series of tax rate reductions to reward productive investment and work effort, and a restrained monetary policy to sustain the purchasing power of individual savings and income. The Drop in Interest Rates
Accompanying the marked progress in unwinding the damaging inflation spiral that plagued our nation for so many years, financial markets in 1982 experienced their first sustained improvement in more than five years. Interest rates throughout the maturity spectrum declined substantially, and by year-end we can proudly report that key rates for home mortgages, consumer loans, and business investment were able to sustain their lower levels, indicating new confidence in Administration policies and bringing much needed relief to the housing and auto industries, the farm community and the export sector.
Inflationary pressures of the sort experienced during the past two decades extracted a heavy toll from our economy. We have learned that the problems we inherited were far worse than most inside and out of government had expected; the recession was deeper and longer than most inside and out of government had predicted. Curing those problems has taken more time and a higher toll than any of us wanted. Unemployment is far too high.
Fortunately, the long nightmare of runaway inflation is now behind us. Slowly, but steadily and unmistakably, our national economy is completing the transition from recession to recovery. The interaction of lower tax rates, reduced inflation, and falling interest rates has placed the consumer and the producer in a much strengthened position with respect to balance sheets, liquidity, after-tax income and purchasing power.
There are numerous signs that the battered, sputtering inflationwarped economy that we found two years ago is on the mend, and that the dislocation and hardship we have suffered in the interim will prove to be a corrective interlude on the path of sustained recovery. But our confidence must also be tempered by realism and patience. Quick fixes and artificial stimulants, repeatedly applied over decades, are what brought on the inflationary disorders that we have now paid such a heavy price to cure. Background on Federal Deficit
In part as a result of the difficult period of disinflation, during the past year and one half our projections of the Federal deficit have steadily risen. They have now reached very high levels, creating uncertainty in the financial markets and threatening to block the economic recovery ahead of us.
But before we consider what is to be done, we must review how we got here. And the truth is that as in the case of the Social Security fund, the looming gaps in our national budget are the consequence of both the inflation that got out of hand and the correctives that have been unavoidably applied to cure it.
During the 1970's, the share of our national income devoted to domestic programs and transfer payments soared by more than 50 percent -from 10 cents to 16 cents on every dollar produced by the American people. For a brief time, it appeared that we could afford all of this generosity because inflation badly misled us.

As inflation reached higher and higher peaks, the Treasury's coffers swelled from its take on inflated incomes and the upward creep of tax rates. For a time, we even financed our trillion-dollar national debt on the cheap with interest rates that had not yet caught up with the spiraling inflation. A View of the Effects
Meanwhile, defense spending grew at less than 60 percent of inflation, making room in the budget for extra domestic programs. The real purchasing power available to maintain our readiness, modernize our weapons, and maintain strategic nuclear safety declined by a startling 20 percent.
But it couldn't last - and it didn't. Today the Federal budget itself has become a major victim of the economic transition:
- The inflationary revenue windfall has dried up.
- Our staggering national debt until recently was being financed at the highest interest rates in peacetime history.
- The undelayable process of restoring our inflation-eroded military budgets and our decayed military strength has further strained our resources.
- Despite our great strides in reducing the spending growth over the last two years, the vast edifice of domestic programs remains significantly in place.
The Social Security system has also been a victim of our economic ills. First, the rampant inflation drained its reserves as Government tried to keep beneficiaries up with the spiraling cost of living that its own mistaken policies had created in the first place. Now the recessionary adjustments to disinflation have temporarily deprived it of the expanding wage base and growing revenues required to support commitments to the retired and disabled. As a result, for too long the specter of Social Security insolvency has haunted our nation's elderly citizens and threatened to rupture the lifeline on which 36 million retired and disabled Americans depend.
But however obvious the threat of insolvency, one thing is certain: Social Security cannot and will not be allowed to fail the 36 million Americans who depend on it. With this commitment in mind, it is especially pleasing to me to join with the Speaker of the House and the Senate majority leader in urging the Congress to enact the bipartisan compromise plan developed by the National Commission on Social Security Reform.
There are elements in it that none of us prefers, but taken together it forms a package all of us can support. It asks for some sacrifice by all - the self-employed, beneficiaries, workers, new Government employees, and the better-off among the retired - but it imposes an undue burden on none. And, in supporting it, we keep an important pledge to the American people: the integrity of the Social Security system will be preserved - and no one's payments will be reduced. Toward Economic Recovery
To enhance prospects for sustained economic recovery and lower unemployment, I am proposing a sweeping set of fiscal policy changes designed to reduce substantially the mounting Federal deficits that threaten the renewal of economic growth. My plan is based on these principles:
It must be bipartisan. Overcoming the deficits and putting the Government's house in order will require the best efforts of all of us.
It must be fair. Just as all will share in the benefits that will come from recovery, all should share fairly in the burden of transition.
It must be prudent. The strength of our national defense must be restored so that we can pursue prosperity in peace and freedom, while maintaining our commitment to the truly needy.
Finally, it must be realistic. We cannot rely on hope alone.

''WITH THESE GUIDING...''
NO. 49090
PICK UP AFTER
''...ON HOPE ALONE.''
With these guiding principles in mind, let me outline a four-part plan to increase economic growth and reduce deficits. Spending Freeze Recommended
First, I am recommending a Federal spending freeze. I know this is strong medicine, but so far we have cut only the rate of increase in Federal spending. The Government has continued to spend more money each year, though not as much as more as it did in the past. Taken as a whole, the budget I am proposing for the next fiscal year will increase no more than the rate of inflation - in other words, the Federal Government will hold the line on real spending. That is far less than many American families have had to do in these difficult times.
I will request that the proposed six-month freeze in cost-ofliving adjustments recommended by the bipartisan National Commission on Social Security Reform be applied to other Government benefit programs. I will also propose a one-year freeze on a broad range of domestic spending programs, and for Federal civilian and military pay and pension programs.
Second, I will ask the Congress to adopt specific measures to control the growth of the so-called uncontrollable spending programs. These are the automatic spending programs, such as food stamps, that cannot be simply frozen - and that have grown by over 400 percent since 1970. They are the largest single cause of the built-in or ''structural'' deficit problem. Our standard here will be fairness - insuring that the taxpayers' hard-earned dollars go only to the truly needy; that none of them is turned away; but that fraud and waste are stamped out. And, I am sorry to say, there is a lot of it out there. In the food stamp program alone, last year we identified almost $1.1 billion in overpayments. The taxpayers are not the only victims of this kind of abuse; the truly needy suffer, as funds intended for them are taken by the greedy. For everyone's sake, we must put an end to such waste and corruption.
Third, I will adjust our program to restore America's defenses by proposing $55 billion in defense savings over the next 5 years. These are savings recommended to me by the Secretary of Defense, who has assured me they can be safely achieved and will not diminish our ability to negotiate arms reductions or endanger America's security. We will not gamble with our national survival. As a percent of G.N.P., the level I am requesting for defense spending in 1984 is less than the United States spent during the decade of the 1960's. As a percent of the total Federal budget it is far less than was allocated for national defense in those years. We are two years into the program to rearm America. Sustaining the momentum of this program is essential if we are to avoid slipping back into the inefficient and counterproductive pattern of wildly fluctuating defense spending levels.
Fourth, because we must insure reduction and eventual elimination of deficits over the next several years, I will propose a standby tax limited to no more than 1 percent of the gross national product to start in fiscal year 1986. It would last no more than three years and would start only if the Congress has first approved our spending freeze and budget control program. You could say that this is an insurance policy for the future - a remedy that will be at hand if needed, but resorted to only if absolutely necessary.
In the meantime, we will continue to study ways to simplify the tax code and make it more fair for all Americans. This is a goal that every American who has ever struggled with a tax form can understand.
At the same time, however, I will oppose any efforts to undo the basic tax reforms we have already enacted - including the 10 percent tax break coming to taxpayers this July and the tax indexing that will protect all Americans from inflationary bracket creep in the years ahead.
PICK UP 4TH AD BUDGET TEXT
BEGINNING
''THIS PLAN IS URGENTLY..''
PICK UP AFTER
''IN THE YEARS AHEAD.'' 'Plan Urgently Needed'
This plan is urgently needed and is geared toward solving the problems of the growing deficits. But it naturally requires the cooperation of both branches of Government, both Houses and both parties. Thus, our plan is aimed at bridging the institutional, philosophical, and political differences that separate us - which are not as important as the overriding common objective of economic recovery and sustained prosperity for America.
After two years of reducing much of the overspending, we have now reached the bone in many places -programs where we will not propose further reductions. My Administration will now work with the Congress in an effort to accommodate those special concerns of the legislative branch that have caused unnecessary strains in the past.
Thus, we will propose $3 billion more for education programs than was proposed last year, and almost $2 billion more for employment and training. Proposals for new rescissions of already enacted budget authority will be held to an absolute minimum.
This budget process must be a two-way street, for the problem of large deficits is very real. Even when all reasonable measures are applied to the vast detail of the budget, the resulting deficits are large and progress toward reducing them slow. The political risks entailed in these deficit-containment measures are considerable. But the risk of doing nothing at all due to partisanship or legislative stalemate is much greater. I therefore urge the Congress to join with my Administration behind this common-sense strategy. Meeting - And Reshaping - Federal Responsibilities
My Administration seeks to limit the size, intrusiveness, and cost of Federal activities as much as possible, and to achieve the needed increase in our defense capabilities in the most cost-effective manner possible. This does not mean that appropriate Federal responsibilities are being abandoned, neglected, or inadequately supported. Instead, ways are being found to streamline Federal activity, to limit it to those areas and responsibilities that are truly Federal in nature; to insure that these appropriate Federal responsibilities are performed in the most cost-effective and efficient manner; and to aid state and local governments in carrying out their appropriate public responsibilities in a similarly costeffective manner. The nation must ask for no more publicly provided services and benefits than the private sector can reasonably be asked to finance.
Education - One of the high priorities I have set for my Administration is the return to the more appropriate role for the Federal Government in the nation's education systems and policies. We have slowed the alarming rate of growth of Federal spending for education, an area that is rightfully and primarily a family and state and local government responsibility. From 1974 to 1981, Federal spending for education increased by 172 percent. From 1981 to 1982, however, outlays declined by more than $1 billion. My Administration has accomplished a major consolidation of small fragmented education programs into a flexible education block grant to states and localities. We have cut back on unnecessary regulation and Federal intrusion in local affairs.
The 1984 budget seeks to stabilize education spending, requesting $13.1 billion in budget authority for 1984. It reflects several important new initiatives to strengthen American education:
- Passing of tuition tax credits for parents who want to send their children to qualified private or religiously affiliated schools.
- Establishing education savings accounts to give middle-@ and lower-@income families an incentive to save for their children's college education and, at the same time, to encourage a real increase in savings for economic growth.
- Reorienting student aid programs to insure that students and families meet their responsibilities for financing higher education, while making funds available across a wider spectrum of schools for the low-income students most in need.
- Allowing states or localities, if they so choose, to use their compensatory education funds to establish voucher programs to broaden family choice of effective schooling methods for educationally disadvantaged children.
- Helping states to train more mathematics and science teachers. These initiatives represent the Administration's continuing commitment to avoid improper Federal involvement in state, local, and family decisions, while preserving proper Federal support for key national policy goals such as supporting compensatory and handicapped education, facilitating access to higher education, and helping states improve science and mathematics education.
Research - My Administration recognizes the Federal responsibility to maintain U.S. leadership in scientific research. Although support of basic scientific research represents a small share of the Federal budget, it is a vital investment in the nation's future. Such research lays the foundation for a strong defense in the years to come, and for new technologies and industries that will help maintain our industrial competitiveness, create new jobs, and improve our quality of life. By carefully establishing budget priorities, my Administration has been able to reinvigorate Federal support for basic scientific research. With my 1984 budget proposals, such support across the Government will have increased by more than 20 percent over the 1982 level.

''HEALTH CARE.''
NO. 49067
PICKS UP AFTER
''...OVER THE 1982 LEVEL.''
Health Care - A major problem for both individuals and the Federal Government in meeting health care needs is the rapid inflation of health care costs. The rate of increase in health care costs is excessive and undermines people's ability to purchase needed health care. Federal policies have contributed significantly to health care cost increases. The budget contains several major initiatives to reduce cost increases. We must eliminate the tax incentive for highcost employee health insurance programs. Savings from Medicare cost controls will be used to protect the aged from catastrophic hospital costs. Incentives will also be proposed to slow the growth of Medicaid costs.
Agriculture - The Administration seeks to move agricultural supply toward a better balance with demand by reducing farm production and Government program stocks. The budget proposes a four-part approach to solving the current surplus supply problem:
- Establishing a payment-in-kind program, under which farmers would receive surplus commodities now held for Federal loans, or owned by the Government, in return for reducing their production;
- Freezing farm crop target prices at current levels;
- Donating Government-held commodities through international humanitarian organizations for needy people around the world; and
- Selling our agricultural produce abroad, both through commercial channels and through governmental negotiation. Efforts are also continuing to identify surplus Federal land holdings for sale from those administered by the Departments of Agriculture and of the Interior. Planned sales total $500 million in 1984.
Transportation - In the transportation area, my Administration has made major strides in implementing one of the fundamental principles in my program for economic recovery: having users pay for program costs that are clearly allocable to them. During the past year, I signed into law two Administration-backed proposals to increase excise taxes on aviation and highway users and thereby provide funding needed to revitalize and modernize these important segments of the nation's transportation system. The 1984 budget reflects the Administration's continued commitment to the ''users pay'' principle by again proposing user fees for:
- Construction and maintenance of deep-draft ports;
- The inland waterway system;
- Selected direct Coast Guard services; and
- Nautical and aviation maps and charts. Recognizing the importance of our transportation system in maintaining and contributing to the nation's economic and social well-being, my Administration secured passage of legislation designed to rebuild the nation's highway and public transportation facilities. This legislation substantially increased funds available to the states and local communities to complete and repair the aging Interstate highway system, to rehabilitate principal rural and urban highways and bridges, and to improve mass transit systems.
Fully capable ports and channels are essential to make U.S. coal exports competitive in world markets. My Administration will work with the Congress to provide for timely and efficient port construction. We propose a system of user fees for existing port maintenance and new port construction. Local governments would be empowered to set up their own financing arrangements for the immediate construction of facilities in their areas.
Reducing the Federal presence in commercial transportation, currently regulated by the Interstate Commerce Commission, the Civil Aeronautics Board, and the Federal Maritime Commission, will improve the efficiency of the industry. To this end, my Administration will seek further deregulation of trucking, airlines, and ocean shipping. Experience since the adoption of initial transportation deregulation legislation has shown clearly that both consumers and industry benefit from reduced Federal involvement in these activities.
Energy - The Administration has significantly reoriented the country's approach to energy matters in the past two years. Reliance on market forces, instead of Government regulation and massive, indiscriminate Federal spending, has resulted in greater energy production, more efficient use of energy, and more favorable energy prices. For example:
- The U.S. economy today is using 18 percent less energy to produce a dollar's worth of output then it did in 1973 when energy prices first began to rise.
- The price of heating oil and gasoline has actually fallen in real terms by 12 percent in the past two years -confounding past theories that insisted that these prices could only increase.
Federal energy programs and policies have been refocused and made more productive:
- Wasteful spending on large, unprofitable technology demonstrations has been curtailed.
- At the same time, spending has increased in areas where the Government has a key role to play - for example, in supporting longterm energy research.
- The strategic petroleum reserve has more than doubled in size over the past two years.

''...PAST TWO YEARS,''
Criminal Justice - My Administration has also sought to strengthen the Federal criminal justice system by proposing major legislative initiatives, such as bail and sentencing reform, by attacking drug trafficking and organized crime, and by achieving a better balance among law enforcement, prosecutorial and correctional resources. Twelve regional task forces will focus on bringing to justice organized crime drug traffickers. The Administration will strengthen efforts to identify, neutralize and defeat foreign agents who pose a threat to the nation.
International Affairs - Our foreign policy is oriented toward maintaining peace through military strength and diplomatic negotiation; promoting market-oriented solutions to international economic problems; telling the story abroad of America's democratic, free enterprise way of life, and increasing free trade in the world while assuring this country's equitable participation in that trade.
- The security assistance portion of the international affairs program has been increased to assist friendly governments facing threats from the Soviet Union, its surrogates, and from other radical regimes.
- Development aid emphasizes encouraging the private sectors of developing nations and increasing United States private sector involvement in foreign assistance.
- A major expansion of international broadcasting activities aimed primarily at Communist countries is planned, and a new initiative will be undertaken to strengthen the infrastructure of democracy around the world.
- Special attention is being given to assuring adequate financing of United States exports while my Administration seeks to obtain further reductions in the export subsidies of other governments.
My Administration will submit to the Congress a proposal to increase the United States quota in the International Monetary Fund and the United States obligations under the I.M.F.'s General Arrangements to Borrow, as soon as negotiations on these issues are completed. This is necessary to insure that the I.M.F. has adequate resources to help bring the world economy back to strong, noninflationary growth.
Although now less than 2 percent of the budget, international programs are critical to American world leadership and to the success of our foreign policy.
Minority-Owned Businesses - My Administration will assist in the establishment or expansion of over 120,000 minority-owned businesses over the next 10 years. The Federal Government will procure an estimated $15 billion in goods and services from minority business during the three-year period 1983-1985. It will make available approximately $1.5 billion in credit assistance and $300 million in technical assistance to promote minority business development during this period.
Civil Service Retirement - The 97th Congress made some improvements in the Civil Service retirement system. However, Civil Service retirement still has far more generous benefits and is much more costly than retirement programs in the private sector or in state and local governments. Accordingly, this budget proposes fundamental changes in Civil Service retirement designed to bring benefits into line with those offered in the private sector and reduce the cost of the system to affordable levels. Retirement benefit changes will be phased in over a period of years in order to avoid upsetting the plans of those at or near retirement. Unemployment Demands Specific Attention
My Administration seeks to provide appropriate assistance to the unemployed. There are three major groups who need help: the largest, those who are unemployed now but will find jobs readily as the economy improves; those whose jobs have permanently disappeared, and youth who have trouble finding their niche in the labor market.
Those in the first group need interim help because, historically, increases in jobs always lag in an economic recovery. Last year we provided a temporary program to give the long-term unemployed up to 16 added weeks of unemployment compensation, in addition to the up to 39 weeks available from our permanent unemployment insurance. This temporary program expires March 31, 1983.
I propose to modify and extend the program for six more months, and provide an option for recipients to receive assistance in securing work through a system of tax credits to employers. This will give employers a significant incentive to hire the long-term unemployed, while workers will get full wages rather than the lower unemployment benefit. New Long-Term Jobs
Those whose jobs have permanently disappeared must be helped to find new long-term occupations. The Job Training Partnership Act, enacted last year, authorizes grants to states to help retrain such workers and assist them in locating and moving to new jobs. The Congress appropriated $25 million to start this new program in 1983. I am requesting $240 million to implement the program fully in 1984.
In addition, I propose that the Federal unemployment law be changed to allow states to use a portion of the unemployment taxes they collect to provide such retraining and job search assistance to their unemployed workers. Regulatory reform and passage of enterprise zone legislation will also create new incentives for jobs and opportunity.

BEGINNING
''THOSE YOUTH WHO...''
NO. 48903
PICK UP ''...JOBS AND OPPORTUNITY.''
Those youth who have problems finding jobs after they leave school are often condemned to a lifetime of intermittent employment and low earnings. The new Job Training Partnership Act is designed to help disadvantaged youth acquire the basic skills potential employers look for when they hire. I am requesting $1.9 billion for the block grant to states under that Act. The states must use at least 40 percent of that for youth.
One of the problems hampering youth is inability to get meaningful work experience during school vacations. Such experience is invaluable to demonstrate their qualifications to potential permanent employers. The budget provides for 718,000 public summer job opportunities for disadvantaged youth. But we must also make it possible for youth to experience work in the private sector. The minimum wage law now frequently prevents this. Inexperienced youth cannot produce enough of value to make it worthwhile for employers to pay them the full minimum wage during short periods of employment. Cutting Minimum Summer Wage
I therefore propose that the minimum wage for summer jobs for youth be reduced to $2.50 an hour. Limitation of the reduced minimum wage to the summer months will make it unlikely that employers will substitute youths for older workers.
I remain adamantly opposed to temporary make-work public jobs or public works as an attempted cure for nonyouth unemployment. There are several reasons for this. The cost per ''job'' created is excessive; we cannot afford major new programs, particularly in our current budgetary straits; the actual number of new jobs ''created'' is minimal; the jobs created tend to be temporary and of a dead-end nature; and most such jobs do not materialize until after recovery is well under way. Improving The Efficiency Of Government
The proposed freeze on program funding levels will compel program managers in every agency of the Government to find more efficient ways of carrying out their programs. For too long, costs of Federal operations have been mounting unchecked.
Good management has not always been a priority of the executive branch. I have been correcting that situation. My Administration has redirected programs to improve their efficiency and to achieve cost savings Governmentwide. My Administration is committed to improving management and reducing fraud, waste, and abuse. The President's Council on Integrity and Efficiency, made up of 18 Inspectors General, reported that almost $17 billion has been saved or put to better use in the past two years.
In 1982, I signed into law the Federal Managers' Financial Integrity Act. Under this Act, my Cabinet officers and other agency heads will report to me and the Congress annually on the status of their efforts to improve management controls that prevent fraud and mismanagement. A number of agencies have already begun to make significant improvements in this important area.
But the Government can go only so far with the seriously outdated and inefficient management-administrative systems that are currently in place. One third of our large-scale computers, for example, are more than 10 years old. A comprehensive management improvement program was needed, so ''Reform '88'' was initiated. We intend to upgrade and modernize our administrative systems to make them more effective and efficient in carrying out the Government's business and serving the public.
We are already saving tax dollars by managing our almost $2 trillion yearly cash flow more effectively, collecting the Government's $250 billion of just debts, cutting Government administrative costs, modernizing Federal procurement systems, reducing internal regulations, controlling our office space and equipment more prudently, and streamlining the workforce in many departments and agencies. These cost-reduction efforts will continue. Continuing Reform Of Our Federal System
The overall efficiency of Government in the United States can also be improved by a more rational sorting out of governmental responsibilities among the various levels of government - Federal, state, and local - in our Federal system, and eliminating or limiting overlapping and duplication.
In 1981, the Congress responded to my proposals by consolidating 57 categorical programs into nine block grants. In 1982, block grants were created for job training in the Jobs Training Partnership Act, and for urban mass transit in the Surface Transportation Act. The initiatives to be proposed this year will expand on these accomplishments.
Four new block grants will be proposed, with assured funding for major functions now addressed through categorical grants.
- A general Federal-state block grant covering approximately 15 categorical programs.
- A Federal-local block grant that would include the entitlement portion of the community development grant program and the general revenue-sharing program.
- A transportation block grant.
- A rural housing block grant. PICK UP 8TH AND LAST ADD BUDGET TEXT BEGINNING ''THE ADMINISTRATION IS..., NO. 48904 PICK UP AFTER ''...HOUSING BLOCK GRANT.''
The Administration is improving the management of intergovernmental assistance by providing state and local elected officials with greater opportunity to express their views on proposed Federal development and assistance actions before final decisions are made. Under Executive Order 12372, Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs, which I signed in July 1982, Federal agencies must consult with state and local elected officials early in the assistance decision process and make every effort to accommodate their views. The order also encourages the simplification of state planning requirements imposed by Federal law, and allows for the substitution of state-developed plans for Federally required state plans where statutes and regulations allow.
Through the President's Task Force on Regulatory Relief and the regulatory review process, the Administration is eliminating and simplifying regulations affecting state and local governments that are burdensome, unnecessary, and counterproductive. These changes have improved local efficiency and accountability and reduced program costs.
Twenty-five reviews were completed during the past two years by either the Task Force or by various Federal agencies. Available data indicate that regulatory relief actions will save state and local governments approximately $4 billion to $6 billion in initial costs, and an estimated $2 billion on an annual basis. My Administration is also simplifying selected, generally applicable cross-cutting requirements that are imposed on state and local governments as a condition of accepting financial assistance. Federal Credit Programs: More Selective
The Administration continues its strong commitment to control Federal credit assistance, which has serious effects on the nation's financial markets. To this end, I propose a credit budget that reverses the accelerated rate of growth in direct and guaranteed lending by the Federal Government that occurred during the second half of the 1970's and the first years of the 1980's.
Federal intervention through guarantees and provision of direct lending misdirects investment and pre-empts capital that could be more efficiently used by unsubsidized, private borrowers. Because Federally assisted borrowers are frequently less productive than private borrowers, large Federal credit demands must be reduced in order to improve prospects for economic growth. Conclusion
The stage is set; a recovery to vigorous, sustainable, noninflationary economic growth is imminent. But given the underlying deterioration in the overall budget structure that has occurred over the past two years, only the most sweeping set of fiscal policy changes could help to reverse the trend and set the budget on a path that is consistent with long-term economic recovery.
If the challenge before us is great, so, too, are the opportunities. Let us work together to meet the challenge. If we fail, if we work at cross purposes, posterity will not forgive us for allowing this opportunity to slip away. RONALD W. REAGAN

Full text: At midterm, the once-dazzling political momentum of what conservatives enthusiastically called the Reagan Revolution has stalled. In the year ahead, President Reagan faces what his allies and advisers see as the most critical tests of his Presidency both at home and abroad.
''Historically, the third year is the one that makes or breaks a Presidency, and Ronald Reagan's third year is more critical for him than any President since World War II,'' said Richard Wirthlin, the President's longtime poll-taker and a fellow California Republican conservative.
''It's the year when people will judge the President not only by the goals he articulated in the campaign or the legislation he has passed, but how his program has affected their lives,'' Mr. Wirthlin said. ''It's also a year in which foreign policy will be given a more severe test.''
On a string of tough issues - the budget, Social Security, military spending, the MX missile, arms control talks with the Russians, Middle East diplomacy - the choice that politicians of both parties see Mr. Reagan confronting is between his ideology and political pragmatism, between the tactics of confrontation and compromise, between sticking with a course that suits the Republican right or shifting more toward the political center. Voicing Private Anxieties
On the major issues, some of the President's White House aides and Cabinet associates see similar forks in the political road. They prefer not to be identified in speaking. But privately, some acknowledge their concern that his presidency faces serious difficulties.
Their brimming optimism of 1981 has been tempered by recession and losses in the November elections as well as by stunning defeats on the MX missile and other issues in the recent special session of Congress. They concede not only the strain of recession but broad Congressional disillusion with the economic program, a perceptible shift in power from the White House toward Congress since November, and open splits and uneasiness among Republicans, especially while there is uncertainty whether Mr. Reagan intends to run in 1984. On Capitol Hill, Republicans grumble that the White House is not being well run but is hobbled by factional tensions.
''I'm usually the Dr. Norman Vincent Peale type, upbeat and trying to smile as often as I can,'' said Robert H. Michel, the Illinois conservative who is House Republican leader, ''but I'm really apprehensive and fearful of where we're going next year unless the economy comes back in the spring.'' 'Some Adjustments' in Course
''If the President doesn't like the word 'compromise,' '' he said, ''well then, let's say he's got to make some adjustments in the original course. There's a problem with people who think there's so much mileage in being right all the time, I don't care who it is, even the President of the United States.''
''You can't govern this country when it's polarized,'' said Senator William Cohen, a Republican moderate from Maine. ''I think the President has got to compromise on most issues until the unemployment rate comes down.''
''There's more resistance in the political system now to more of the President's desire for change,'' David Gergen, the White House communications director, conceded. ''It's too early to judge how this Presidency will go down. If the next two years are as productive as the first two, he'll go down as the first successful Presidency in 20 years. But there are a lot more obstacles. We're in a difficult period now. It's going to be tougher with Congress. But at least he's got the foundation laid.''
In public appearances, President Reagan projects undiminished the jaunty confidence of his 1980 campaign or his stunningly successful 1981 legislative year. He reminds visitors that in his first two years, inflation fell from 13.1 to 4.8 percent, interest rates dropped from 21 percent to 11.5 percent, and the pace of growth in Federal spending has been slowed while the growth of military spending has been accelerated.
But in place of his earlier calls for a balanced Federal budget in 1983 or 1984 and economic recovery that would deal with both inflation and unemployment, Mr. Reagan now talks of ''structural deficits'' of well over $100 billion and ''structural unemployment'' of 6 to 6.5 percent. 'Horrendous Deficits' Coming
In year-end interviews, he tacitly acknowledges that a long, draining effort lies ahead. ''We're going to be faced with horrendous deficits for several years,'' he told editors of the Hearst newspapers. ''You cannot cut the budget enough to balance it. You cannot raise taxes enough to balance it.''
And when his close associates are promised anonymity, some say that even though the President generally voices his faith in his program, they have lately detected a subtle change in private moments.
''He's more cautious, more reflective,'' said one close associate. ''He's not a man given to saying 'I'm worried' or 'I'm concerned,' but you do occasionally hear him say things like that now in a general sense. He's not yet translated that into specific things like saying, 'I wonder if we're doing the right thing on the economy,' or 'I wonder if we're going for too much on defense.' It's more general than that: worrying aloud about Congress or being concerned about the economy.''
Nonetheless, senior White House officials discourage expectation that President Reagan will readily bend in his dealings with the new Congress.
''The Reagan you saw on MX was a confrontational Reagan,'' one senior Presidential aide said. ''He went for the production funds that he wanted. When he got beaten, he compromised.'' 'He'll Go for 75 Percent'
''Next year, you're going to see a Reagan who's not going to be quick to compromise on principle,'' this official continued. ''But if he can get 75 percent of what he wants, he'll go for 75 percent and not insist on 100 percent if he can't get that. Of course, we know it's going to be tougher for us to get what he wants in the future.''
Political realities have changed dramatically since 1981. The loss of 26 Republican seats in the House has buried the Reagan coalition that passed his big budget and tax cuts of 1981 and has given Democrats control of the House.
Beyond that, White House strategists acknowledge that the elections showed an erosion of public support; many minority, blue collar and elderly voters who supported Mr. Reagan in 1980 went back to the Democratic Party.
They also concede that the election mood will affect the legislative debate in 1983. As Mr. Gergen observed, ''to be even talking now about cuts in entitlement programs brands you as antiblack, antipoor and insensitive.'' Some of the 19 Republican senators up for re-election in 1984 are acutely sensitive to avoiding these labels as they approach the new Congressional session. Not the Feared Figure He Was
In sum, the President's political impact has diminished. He is not the feared figure of 18 months ago. Moreover, the unity of the Republican Senate majority was seriously wounded by the conservative filibuster against increasing the Federal gasoline tax that was led by Senator Jesse Helms, the North Carolina Republican.
''People up here will be looking to see whether the White House draws a line against Helms in the new year,'' said an aide to Senator Howard H. Baker Jr., the majority leader. ''The President will have to choose pretty early between the right and the center.''
The President's willingness to compromise next year will ''depend on the issue,'' his aides say. On Social Security revisions, he is described as wanting to develop a bipartisan solution, even starting with some possible bargaining in the bipartisan commission. On taxes, they say he is adamant about keeping in place the 10 percent cut in the tax rate scheduled for July.
Some Congressional Republicans believe that Mr. Reagan must give a signal of new political realism in his State of the Union Address in the form of proposals dealing with unemployment and the hard-hit ''smokestack industries'' of the Northeast and Middle West. But a more prevalent view is that the key indicator will be his stand on military spending: Will he go for high growth or moderate his past trend? Some See His Goals as Too High
In preliminary Administration discussions, President Reagan has given the impression he wants cuts of $20 billion in domestic programs and a real increase of 10 to 12 percent in military spending. Republican leaders regard that as unrealistic.
''The President has just got to recognize he's going to have to make some adjustments there,'' said Mr. Michel. ''He's going to want to hang tough. But when you have members of the Armed Services Committee, some pretty hard-neck guys, saying there's something wrong with his levels, then the President just can't blindly ignore it.''
The White House thinking is that the President knows privately he will have to compromise eventually but will want to stake out a tough early bargaining position. But Democrats and even some Republicans warn that tactic is risky. ''If the President comes in and plays the old budget game and his budget is rejected by both parties, it could just deal him out of the budget negotiations,'' Representative James R. Jones, chairman of the House Budget Committee, said. Foreign Policy Is the Reverse
Curiously, as the President seems to have lost political initiative with Congress, the reverse has happened in foreign policy. Once fairly aloof and disengaged, he has now become more involved and taken some new initiatives. Some of his advisers are hopeful that foreign affairs will provide important breakthroughs in 1983, though they acknowledge the pitfalls.
Problems with Western Europe have eased somewhat, thanks largely to the quiet diplomacy of Secretary of State George P. Shultz. But protectionist sentiment remains a politically explosive force in Congress as well as in Europe and Japan. While 1982 left a standoff both with China and the Soviet Union, the President and his advisers now sense an opportunity in the Middle East.
As the year ends, the Administration has had to concede failure in its effort to arrange the withdrawal of troops of Israel, Syria and the Palestine Liberation Organization from Lebanon, one key to progress. But lately, direct talks between Lebanon and Israel have engendered hope.
On a parallel track, President Reagan has pushed hard to draw King Hussein of Jordan into talks with Egypt and Israel on Palestinian self-rule. After two rounds of talks with Hussein, Mr. Reagan voiced the hope that this target was now ''within our reach.'' Assurances to King Reported
Building on his initiative of Sept. 1, which gave the outline for a broad Palestinian agreement linking the West Bank loosely with Jordan, the President was reported to have given the King some assurances of American backing for the Arab position that Israel should relinquish sovereignty over most of the West Bank.
This is Mr. Reagan's most ambitious and risky venture in personal diplomacy. It runs the perils of intricate and inconclusive maneuvering by King Hussein and the Palestinian leadership and sharp confrontation with Israel with repercussions in the Unitd States, should Hussein declare that he will enter the negotiations if Israel will halt its settlement program on the West Bank.
With Moscow, Mr. Reagan has only just begun serious political exchanges with the new Soviet leader, Yuri V. Andropov. But Administration policy-makers expect the pace of arms negotiations and the accompanying propaganda maneuvering to intensify next spring and summer.
Although American interest has traditionally been on strategic arms talks, there is little sign of much active bargaining. Far more acute and active diplomacy involves the Administration's effort to get Moscow to dismantle its force of 333 SS-20 medium range missiles with the threat to deploy 572 American missiles in Europe, starting late in 1983, or accepting a complete ban on both sets of missiles. Some Expect Both to Moderate
Washington's quick rejection of Mr. Andropov's offer to take the Soviet inventory down to 162 missiles, to match the British and French forces, merely sets the stage for further moves. Although the President and his spokesman firmly insist on the Reagan ''zero option,'' calling for each side to scrap its medium range missiles, there are hints that some officials expect both Moscow and Washington to moderate their stances.
But officials concede these are delicate negotiations that will test not only American ingenuity but the strength and support of West European governments who have sought the American missiles but whose publics are tempted by arms control proposals. Some officials believe President Reagan will be hard-pressed to avoid being thrown on the political defensive unless he shows flexibility.
It is almost inevitable that the sense of pressure on all fronts raises the question of changes in the Reagan Cabinet or White House staff, often traditional in a third year. Cabinet Changes Expected
The President himself, talking to the Hearst editors on Dec. 13, hinted at coming changes. Speaking of his Cabinet, he said, ''A number are going to have to return to their own activities, and I am going to hate to lose them.''
He mentioned no names, but there has already been talk about the possible departure in spring or summer of Raymond H. Donovan, the Labor Secretary; Samuel R. Pierce Jr., Secretary of Housing and Urban Development; and David A. Stockman, director of the Office of Management and Budget.
Although White House officials contend that James A. Baker 3d, the White House chief of staff, and Ed Meese 3d, the President's counselor, have restored reasonable working relations after some earlier frictions, prominent Congressional Republicans complain of tensions and lack of coordination between them. Moreover, Michael K. Deaver, the President's close aide and deputy White House chief of staff, has talked persistently of leaving for private business in spring or early summer and his departure could precipitate a major White House shake-up.
But ultimately, Mr. Reagan's political fate, and probably even his decision on running for a second term, rides on the economy, where the outlook is poor. As the recession has stretched on, professional economists have lowered their projections for economic growth in 1983 from 3 or 4 percent to 1.5 to 2 percent, and unemployment has pushed up to 10.8 percent.
More and more Republicans say that the President's program, which Senator Baker termed ''a riverboat gamble,'' is not paying off. Anemic Recovery No Help
Presidential advisers assert that recovery will come but worry that it will be so anemic that it will leave Republicans running for reelection with unemployment close to 10 percent late in 1984. In the budget debate, they are privately at odds over over whether the President should make his target roughly 3 percent or 5 percent growth over the next two years, risking continued high unemployment with fairly tight money on the one hand or inviting a looser monetary policy and rekindling inflation on the other.
''We all believe recovery is coming in 1983, but the significant question is how long and how strong will it be,'' said one Presidential aide. ''Everybody agrees we can't just leave the economy on automatic pilot and we've got to do more. But there's no agreement now on what that means we should do.''

Full text: Last of six articles that have appeared periodically on current world economic problems
After three decades of the greatest growth in history, the world economy has been caught for the last three years in what a committee of international economists assembled by the United
Nations calls ''a vicious spiral of contraction.'' The key economic issue facing all nations today is how to break that spiral and get back on a path of steady growth. But there are sharp disagreements among governments on how to proceed.
High unemployment in the industrial world, the most severe since the Depression of the 1930's, is increasing pressure on governments to pursue ''beggar my neighbor'' policies, excluding foreign goods or devaluing currencies to save jobs at home, whatever the consequences for other nations. Suffering and Instability
Disputes between industrialized countries and developing countries have grown worse as the developing nations see the prices of their commodities fall and the incomes of many of their people depressed to - or below -the subsistence level.
''Present trends in the world economy,'' warns the Committee for Development Planning of the United Nations, ''point to the danger of further contraction and stagnation, entailing extensive human suffering in many of the poorest developing countries, as well as risks of widespread political instability.''
The decades of expanding world trade that followed World War II have bound the fate of all nations together. Economic Interdependence
The United States, Japan and Europe are linked by vast flows of money, and every advanced industrial country sells from one-third to one-half of its manufactured exports to the developing countries.
And the Communist countries of Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union and China are increasingly linked to the developed market economies of East Asia, Western Europe and North America as well as to the developing countries.
This economic interdependence accelerated expansion during the prosperous years through growing trade, higher output and greater production efficiency resulting from the international division of labor. Competition for Markets
But this same interdependence is now aggravating the shrinkage of the world economy, as foreign markets contract and nations seek to protect their own economies.
Until the beginning of the 1980's, the leading countries of the industrial world shared a common perspective on economic policy, giving priority to fighting inflation, with the major stress on monetary restraint.
The second ''oil shock'' of 1979 jolted the world into higher inflation and initially strengthened the consensus on tightening the flow of money. In the United States the change was signaled by President Jimmy Carter's replacement of G. William Miller as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board with Paul A. Volcker, for the stated purpose of bringing down double-digit inflation and bolstering the failing dollar through a tough monetary policy.
One result of this widespread assault on inflation was a steep rise in unemployment to the highest levels since the Depression. And it is climbing unemployment that has broken the anti-inflation consensus within and among nations. Choices Facing the U.S.
The Reagan Administration appears split: Should it pursue stimulative fiscal policies - such as relaxation of monetary curbs - despite huge looming budget deficits? Or should it take a more austere approach, raising taxes, cutting spending - including military outlays - and thus narrowing the budget deficit, while keeping monetary policy relatively restrictive in order to bring down inflation and interest rates?
Other countries are on courses dictated by their leaders' ideologies and the interests of their major constituencies. The Conservative Margaret Thatcher, strengthened politically by Britain's victory over Argentina in the Falkland Islands war, seems determined to hold to her hard-boiled free-market and monetarist course, although, with unemployment above 14 percent, there are signs that the British are loosening the monetary reins.
But France, under its Socialist President, Francois Mitterrand, has put through a program of nationalization of selected industries and banks. This has provoked a flight of capital to other countries, weakening the franc and jeopardizing the drive to stimulate growth and bring down unemployment. Earlier U.S. Effort Noted
The Mitterrand attempt to go for growth on its own mirrored the earlier effort of the Carter Administration, during its first three years in office, to spur expansion and reduce unemployment - an effort that was aborted by worsened inflation and a weakened dollar.
The nations have become so interdependent that a program for growth apparently needs to be based on a coordinated international policy. Yet it is clear that any program for world recovery will depend, first and foremost, on policies to regenerate continuing expansion in the United States, still the most important economy in the world and a crucial market for both rich and poor countries.
But there is not yet any agreement, in the United States or the other leading industrial countries, on what policy for lasting recovery should be. A struggle is still going on over whether to give the highest priority to ending unemployment or to stopping inflation.
Sir Geoffrey Howe, Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer and a strong monetarist, has argued that stable growth will resume only when the back of inflation has been decisively broken. To push for expansion prematurely, he contends, would be to lose the hard, costly struggle against inflation just when it can be won. More Arguments Heard
But monetarism - its most famous advocate is Prof. Milton Friedman, a winner of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science - is being assailed these days not only by liberals but also by conservatives such as Friedrich A. von Hayek, another Nobel laureate, who maintains that moderate monetary restraint is simply prolonging the agony of both unemployment and inflation.
Professor von Hayek said recently that, if inflation was to be stopped and growth restored, ''you have to do it rapidly and drastically.'' In an interview a decade ago, he said it would be a lot easier to get the people of a democratic country to endure 30 percent unemployment for six months than to endure 10 percent unemployment for three years.
No government in the West appears prepared to risk such shock treatment. On the contrary, pressures are building within all countries for a shift toward policies of fiscal and monetary stimulus, to stave off the threat of depression and induce early recovery. The New Game: Fighting Depression
Some economists believe the world is already in a depression. Prof. George Stigler of the University of Chicago, this year's Nobel laureate in economics, made the term ''depression'' respectable when he used it to describe the current slump after emerging from a meeting with President Reagan.
Whether the world is in a recession or depression is, as he said, a semantic question. Whatever the semantics, this is not yet nearly so catastrophic a depression as that of the 1930's. But many economists and international groups have warned that it could degenerate into a state comparable to the collapse that brought Adolf Hitler to power in Germany and led inexorably to World War II.
How to prevent another deep depression is an issue most economists thought they would never have to face again. A consensus among economists emerged in the late 1930's and 40's - a consensus that the basic answer to depression had been discovered by the British economist John Maynard Keynes and his followers. Prescribing a Mixture
That answer was a call for national governments, when output fell to levels too low to sustain high employment, to increase the total level of money demand for goods and services to create more jobs.
This could be done by the right mixture of fiscal and monetary measures - by cutting taxes or raising government expenditures, even if this meant incurring large budget deficits, and by supplying more money to the economy and reducing interest rates to encourage consumer spending and business investment.
Many economists still believe in that basic Keynesian solution. But most believe it too simplistic and too inflation-prone. Many ''post-Keynesian'' economists, such as Prof. Sidney Weintraub of the University of Pennsylvania, have as a major theme the supplementing of general economic policies with an ''incomes policy'' to provide tax incentives or penalties to induce labor and management to make wage decisions that do not add to inflation. Different Focus Suggested
Also emerging is a group that might be called post-monetarists - economists who hold that the monetarists believe in too simple and rigid a link between a measurable supply of money and the level of prices.
Some critics of monetarism, such as Prof. Benjamin Friedman of Harvard and Henry Kaufman, chief economist at Salomon Brothers, believe that the monetary authorities should focus more on the total credit needs of the economy and on interest rates.
Others coming from a monetarist background, such as Prof. Ronald McKinnon of Stanford University, believe the Federal Reserve's monetary policy has been technically mismanaged because the central bank has focused on national rather than world money in an era of international financial interdependence. Professor McKinnon maintains that the money supply of the industrial countries is a better determinant of United States economic activity than the domestic money supply.
He contends that when the Federal Reserve failed to accommodate the surging international demand for the dollar that started in late 1980, the value of the dollar rose to unrealistic levels, damaging America's trade position, while strong demand for the dollar and unduly tight monetary reins produced higher interest rates and a much steeper recession than Washington had expected. Emergence of a New Consensus
Although it is too early to be certain, a new post-Keynesian and post-monetarist consensus appears to be emerging. This consensus would take as its point of departure the current world slump, with its grave deflationary dangers, reminiscent of the problems that the world confronted half a century ago. Deflationary pressures are particularly hurting the developing countries, which are so dependent on the prices they get for their commodity exports, and are even jeopardizing the existence of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
Although the drop in oil prices may eventually ease the problems of international deficits suffered by the oil-importing nations, it could in the interim intensify world financial problems by drying up international flows of capital that had been generated by the members of OPEC. Their surpluses, now sliding into deficits, have been recycled by American and other Western banks, which have been able to make use of the funds on deposit.
The strains on the financial system have grown intense as the enormous accumulations of debt have run into hundreds of billions of dollars. Recent international meetings, such as last week's Frankfurt gathering of the United States, West Germany, France, Britain and Japan, have been efforts to devise a plan for preventing the collapse of that mountain of debt. The Aftereffects of Wars
As painful as world inflation has been, world deflation could be even worse, accelerating the spiral into a deep depression. Historically, deep depressions have, sooner or later, followed major wars.
Edward M. Bernstein, the first research director of the International Monetary Fund, contended more than two decades ago that the critical historical link between war and economic depression had been the relation between gold reserves and the quantity of money, together with the rigidity and mismanagement of currency rates.
Wars exhausted the money-creating powers of the gold-standard countries. After wars ended, the limitations of holding gold reserves forced deflation upon them.
After World War I, for instance, all the major countries adopted highly restrictive monetary policies, which, by the end of the 1920's, had choked off economic growth. World deflation was aggravated by protectionist trade policies. In the United States the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 hurt other countries' exports, provoking retaliation, and led those hurt to engage in severe deflation to maintain their currencies' exchange rates. Bretton Woods and GATT
After World War II, the United States, Britain and other major nations were determined to end the cycle of wartime booms and postwar busts.
They pledged themselves to avoid protectionism through the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. And, at the 1944 monetary conference held at Bretton Woods, N.H., they created a monetary system intended to be more flexible and expansive than the old gold standard, although at its center was the fixed relationship between the dollar and gold, which was pegged at $35 an ounce.
But the United States, by running deficits and supplying dollars and gold to the rest of the world and by accepting others' currency devaluations, made it possible for both world economic growth - and inflation - to continue far longer than it had after World War I.
This could not last forever. As early as 1959, Prof. Robert Triffin of Yale pointed out the dilemma: The monetary system depended on United States deficits and the supply of dollars (which greatly exceeded gold production) to create additional foreign reserves. But it was also steadily weakening the dollar as an asset that nations would be willing to hold. Introduction of 'Paper Gold'
The creation of special drawing rights (''paper gold'') was supposed to solve that problem. In fact, however, it was not S.D.R.'s but the emergence of the Eurodollar market and, after 1973, the ending of the fixed exchange rate between the dollar and gold and the subsequent floating of all currencies that permitted the game of growth-and-inflation to continue.
But that phase generated excessive inflation, weakened the dollar further and unsettled the monetary system to the point of instability, and it petered out in the late 1970's.
The long-deferred post-World War II deflation could not be avoided any longer. And monetarism - curbs on the growth of the money supply - played the role that the gold standard had played after World War I in bringing growth and inflation to a halt. Monetarism was advocated by its champions as a means of correcting inflation without causing depression, since the money supply would still be allowed to grow, but at a more moderate, noninflationary pace. Offering a Bundle of Solutions
The reality has been much harsher than anticipated in terms of unemployment, slumping production and trade. Economists are searching once again for a way out of the dangerous bind - a path that will lead to economic recovery without sidetracking back to the inflation that compelled the United States and other countries to take the painful deflationary steps that have led to the current problems.
They recognize that stimulative policies will need strong international cooperation, at least among the major countries, led by the United States, Japan and West Germany.
They also see a need for reform of the international monetary system, to find a way between the instability of floating exchange rates and the rigidity of fixed exchange rates. Comments From Economists
Prof. Peter Kenen of Princeton University, a leading international economist, criticizes the ''sense of paralysis'' of government officials and central bankers in failing to move more decisively to repair the world monetary system.
M. Louise Curley, a vice president and economist at Scudder, Stevens & Clark, the investment counseling concern, warns that there is still ''no consensus on monetary policy.'' But she, too, says, ''Only a global approach will work,'' and she calls for ''prudent shifts in monetary and fiscal policy, which will have to vary from country to country.'' She says there may have to be target zones for exchange rates of major countries.
Robert Hormats, a former Assistant Secretary of State under President Reagan, believes that, ''little by little, understanding is emerging.'' While urging stronger international mesures to prevent beggar-my-neighborism through trade barriers or competitive devaluations, Mr. Hormats recognizes that this will be hard unless recovery begins.
''Keynes may be right now, given the massive unemployed resources in the world,'' he says. ''The biggest risks are on the downside.'' He says interest rates need to be driven down further, declaring, ''Paul Volcker should be aware of the risks all over the world. This is not just a domestic issue.'' Since Death of Brezhnev
James D. Wolfensohn, president of the international investment company that bears his name, sees an urgent need for American ''economic and social leadership.'' He says that, with the death of the Soviet leader Leonid I. Brezhnev, there is an opportunity to ''refocus'' military policy, and that this would contribute to bringing down budget deficits from the $200 billion range.
He hopes President Reagan ''is more pragmatic than some of the things he has said.'' Until domestic and international debt problems are addressed effctively, Mr. Wolfensohn says, the outlook will remain bleak.
The economists agree there is no one big solution. Many elements will be involved: changes in monetary and fiscal policy to promote recovery, measures to shore up the monetary system and rescue banks threatened with collapse, actions to combat rising protectionism, special help for the debt-ridden countries of the third world and, perhaps most important of all, stronger leadership and a political commitment to rescue the world economy from unemployment and stagnation.
If the slump lasts too long, many fear it could end in the breakdown so long avoided. There is widespread apprehension that the world is again facing the inevitable ''appointment in Samarra'' with the collapse that follows the postwar boom.
The greatest hope that a replay of history can be prevented comes from the widespread recognition of the threat and the slowly emerging consensus on all that needs to be done to prevent it.

Abstract: Charles T. Manatt, the Democratic national chairman, offered one caustic analysis of why reduced inflation rates were not helping the Republicans more. ''Inflation is the heaviest burden on the elderly,'' he said, ''and instead of gaining any credit from them, the Republicans have just scared and scared and re-scared them about Social Security.'' They sound more frustrated than despondent. ''Slowly, very slowly, we're getting a little more credit,'' said Mr. [Robert M. Teeter], who argued that there was a deep, underlying ''fear and specter of inflation'' still to be tapped. Mr. [Edward J. Rollins] said he would be satisfied if Mr. [Reagan] advanced from getting ''very little'' credit to getting ''some credit.'' Then, he said, his party might move up from getting ''none'' to ''a little.''

Full text: Republicans appear to be receiving more blame than credit from the electorate for the performance of the economy. They seem to be losing more support because of rising unemployment than they are gaining from lessened inflation, lower interest rates and a cut in income taxes.
Part of their problem is that much of the public does not believe that inflation has been checked. But perhaps even more significant, in the view of such Republicans as Richard B. Wirthlin, President Reagan's poll-taker, is that when unemployment is as severe as it is, it muffles other, more pleasant economic notes.
In the long run, Republicans may get the credit they say they deserve. But they would prefer it from voters now, rather than from economic historians later, and the short run lasts only 18 more days, until Election Day. Thrust of Reagan's Address
President Reagan's television speech Wednesday night, saying the progress being made on inflation would soon help check unemployment, was the biggest Republican salvo in a political barrage that seeks to alter the balance between blame and credit by Nov. 2.
The 23-minute speech was officially described as nonpartisan. But all Mr. Reagan did to change from his partisan mode was to omit the castigations of Democrats. His positive arguments were the same as before. He closed with an appeal for ''staying the course'' that duplicates the message of the 30-second television commercials that House Republicans are broadcasting.
Mr. Wirthlin said in an interview yesterday that his polling showed some slow progress for Mr. Reagan himself in receiving credit for lessened inflation and lower interest rates.
But in general, the Republican campaign has not succeeded in changing a situation that Edward J. Rollins, Mr. Reagan's chief political aide, describes this way:
''The President is getting a little credit for his accomplishments, but I think very little. The party is getting none whatsoever. The reason is simple. Most Americans don't feel economically better off.''
Although some Republicans argue that an underlying fear of inflation is an important political asset for them, it is plain that that issue has receded in public consciousness.
When Mr. Reagan took office, for example, 37 percent of the public considered inflation the nation's most important problem while 10 percent cited unemployment, according to the New York Times/CBS News Poll. Last month, asked the same question, 24 percent said unemployment and 4 percent said inflation. Worries about the economy in general as the most important problem more than doubled in the same period, to 44 percent from 19 percent. Fears of New Depression
For more than a decade, Republicans have argued that the politics of the economy have changed, and that postwar fears of a return to the Great Depression have ebbed. Consequently, they have contended, inflation that affected everyone constituted a bigger element in politics than did the unemployment of 5 or 6 or 7 percent of the labor force, a group that did not vote much anyway.
Whether that idea was ever correct, it appears wrong today. The National unemployment rate has reached 10.1 percent. It includes millions accustomed to steady work, for whom voting has been as much a badge of middle-class status as mortgage payments and new cars. The Americans who have told this year's Times/CBS News Polls that there has been adult unemployment in their families do not appear significantly less likely to vote than the rest of the public.
Nor is it just those who have been laid off who are affected politically. Most politicians feel that it is the fear of unemployment among those who have seen their co-workers lose their jobs that affects votes. Problem of Credibility
Republican candidates try to make the case that Mr. Reagan made on television. But though effects vary a bit from place to place, they often have a hard time selling it. Webb Franklin, a Congressional candidate, said in Cleveland, Miss., on Monday that the 10.1 percent rate ''is definitely a burden.''
But Republicans have another problem. Much of the public does not believe that inflation has abated, even though Mr. Reagan was correct in saying that an increase of 12.4 percent in the Consumer Price Index in 1980 slowed to a rate of 5.1 percent so far this year.
''It's disturbing that not too many believe it,'' said Representative Guy Vander Jagt, chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee. The Times/CBS News Poll found both in May and September that the public was divided into three almost equal groups: those who believe prices are rising faster than a year earlier, those who think they are rising more slowly or those who believe they are rising at about the same rate. 'The Heaviest Burden'
Charles T. Manatt, the Democratic national chairman, offered one caustic analysis of why reduced inflation rates were not helping the Republicans more. ''Inflation is the heaviest burden on the elderly,'' he said, ''and instead of gaining any credit from them, the Republicans have just scared and scared and re-scared them about Social Security.''
Two other recent elements of the Administration's reports of success seem to have had even less impact. Mr. Reagan spoke proudly of both declining interest rates and the surge in stock market prices as evidence of the success of his economic program.
Robert M. Teeter, another leading Republican poll-taker, said those developments had political value, as ammunition ''to prove that the economy is really getting better and that unemployment will follow.''
Mr. Wirthlin said he felt that interest rates were coming to be viewed by the public as ''a standard barometer of how other things are doing.'' Factor of Interest Rates
But he said that since rates on consumer loans, automobile loans and home mortgages still remained very high, the political value of well-publicized reductions in the prime rate was limited. ''I don't think the average American has seen the effect of the drop in interest rates yet,'' he observed.
The political meaning of the stock market boom is also disputed, even among Democrats. Patrick H. Caddell, a leading poll-taker, scoffed at it, saying, ''The American people view the stock market the way they view sorcery.''
But Matt Reese, a longtime Democratic consultant, said he sometimes found that a Wall Street boom translated into hope in the country. And Mr. Vander Jagt contended that such a belief was actually ''deeply ingrained in the American psychology.''
Leading Republicans hope that a renewed burst of advertising, and perhaps more appearances by Mr. Reagan, can alter the perceptions they know they face just enough to take advantage of local issues, money, and other campaign advantages in particular races.
They sound more frustrated than despondent. ''Slowly, very slowly, we're getting a little more credit,'' said Mr. Teeter, who argued that there was a deep, underlying ''fear and specter of inflation'' still to be tapped.
Mr. Rollins said he would be satisfied if Mr. Reagan advanced from getting ''very little'' credit to getting ''some credit.'' Then, he said, his party might move up from getting ''none'' to ''a little.''

FIGHTING INFLATION IS UPHILL ALL THE WAY

Abstract: * Finally, labor-cost ''pressures have been moderating,'' as employers pare wage and benefit increases. The rebound in productivity normally associated with recoveries would also help hold down costs. So will labor's caution. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the stresses of import competition and recession have been such that nearly three-fifths of the 1.9 million workers covered by major collective bargaining settlements reached so far this year ''will receive no specific wage increase'' except what may come from cost-of-living formulas. More than 90 percent of these workers are in hard-hit autos and trucking. (The United Auto Workers, negotiating with Chrysler this weekend against a Tuesday midnight contract expiration, signed new contracts with the other car companies earlier this year.) ''We've been fighting the wrong dragon since the beginning of the year,'' Edward Jefferson, chairman of the DuPont Company, says. ''The problem was not inflation but the wasting of the economy, getting the economy running again.'' With interest rates still high despite some cautious Federal Reserve action to ease them, the prognosis for recovery is guarded. The latest figures, Data Resources Inc. said last week, pointed to ''a long bottoming-out process.'' The absence of clear signs of recovery was underscored last week by the Commerce Department's report that despite the inducements of last year's [Ronald Reagan] tax cut business has again scaled down planned capital investment.

Full text: Embarrassed by ballooning budget deficits and record postwar unemployment, the Administration has one solid economic achievement - successfully squeezing inflation - and no doubt will make the most of it on behalf of Republican candidates this fall.
Inflation has come down faster than seemed possible when Ronald Reagan was sworn in 20 months ago, but at a price - a crunching recession with heavy losses of jobs and corporate profits and consequently Federal revenues. Some critics, and not all of them Democratic politicians or labor leaders, suggest the battle against inflation was carried to an extreme.
''We've been fighting the wrong dragon since the beginning of the year,'' Edward Jefferson, chairman of the DuPont Company, says. ''The problem was not inflation but the wasting of the economy, getting the economy running again.'' With interest rates still high despite some cautious Federal Reserve action to ease them, the prognosis for recovery is guarded. The latest figures, Data Resources Inc. said last week, pointed to ''a long bottoming-out process.'' The absence of clear signs of recovery was underscored last week by the Commerce Department's report that despite the inducements of last year's Reagan tax cut business has again scaled down planned capital investment.
On inflation, however, progress has been dramatic. The improvement was reflected in Friday's report of a moderate August rise of sixtenths of one percent in the producer price index for finished goods and slight declines for raw materials and semi-finished goods. The finished goods index, a clue to retail price trends, stood 4 percent higher than a year ago, half the rate of gain recorded a year ago.
Early in 1981, the basic inflation rate was 9 percent to 10 percent, with the Consumer Price Index charging along at an even faster clip. There had been some slowdown since early 1980, when a temporary burst of the C.P.I., approaching a 20 percent annual rate, had forced President Carter to tear up his budget and impose credit controls. But double-digit inflation was still a worrisome reality, a threat to the well-being of the jobless and the employed, pensioners and investors. Since January 1981, the basic inflation rate (and the C.P.I.) has come down to roughly 6 to 7 percent. Some analysts are optimistic that further progress can be made even if the overdue rebound from the 1981-82 recession is starting.
Still, progress will be slow. In 1983, according to a tabulation of 43 forecasts, consumer price inflation will slip to 5.9 percent, from 6.2 percent this year. By 1984, some forecasters say, there could be some resurgence, if sustained recovery occurs. ''We have the potential for reducing the inflation rate by about a point a year without any significant real costs,'' said William A. Niskanen, acting chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers.
The Reasons for Moderation
Mr. Niskanen estimated that squeezing one percentage point a year out of the inflation rate was compatible with 3 percent average economic growth, with ''an upside of 4 or 5 percent for a year or two.'' The Administration takes the monetarist view, which emphasizes excessive money supply growth as the cause of inflation. The more conventional approach sees the money supply as one of several causes. Taking a pluralistic tack, Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates lists the following reasons for expecting ''moderate inflation.''
* An absence ''well into 1984'' of shortages of labor and production capacity. Factories now have more than 30 percent of their facilities idle.
* Abundant wheat and corn harvests, and large carryover stocks, will keep grain prices low. Citibank calculates corn prices are down 27 percent from 1981, wheat down 8 percent.
* With oil supplies tending to outstrip consumption and more production being developed, energy prices will be moderate ''at least until 1984,'' says Wharton. Oil prices are likely to rise less than inflation for several years, Mr. Niskanen adds, though ''we can have a shock at any time,'' such as a shutdown of production in Iraq or Iran.
* Finally, labor-cost ''pressures have been moderating,'' as employers pare wage and benefit increases. The rebound in productivity normally associated with recoveries would also help hold down costs. So will labor's caution. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the stresses of import competition and recession have been such that nearly three-fifths of the 1.9 million workers covered by major collective bargaining settlements reached so far this year ''will receive no specific wage increase'' except what may come from cost-of-living formulas. More than 90 percent of these workers are in hard-hit autos and trucking. (The United Auto Workers, negotiating with Chrysler this weekend against a Tuesday midnight contract expiration, signed new contracts with the other car companies earlier this year.)
The wage slowdown has occurred also among nonunion workers, who are 80 percent of the labor force. The Labor Department's employment cost index for private nonfarm workers showed a 1.3 percent rise in the spring, down from 1.9 percent in 1981.
Not least, mortgage interest rates have started to decline. That may not mean much to families outside the housing market, but it helps to hold down the Consumer Price Index, at least until rents are substituted for home purchase costs in January. Lower interest rates also mean cost relief for business.
Ten years ago this autumn, the Nixon Administration, having invoked mandatory price and wage controls, was striving to haul the inflation rate below 3 percent. Not even the determinedly bullish Reagan Administration economic forecast of July held out the prospect of 3 percent inflation in the foreseeable future. Its best hope was 5.4 percent in 1987.

Abstract: The bill currently has 218 sponsors in the house (enough for passage), 17 sponsors in the Senate and action on the legislation is expected within a few weeks. Not surprisingly, the United States domestic auto makers, which are using more foreign parts themselves but cannot afford to alienate the U.A.W., have declined to take sides. By [Malcolm Baldrige] SEVERAL versions of a ''local content'' bill, which would require ana uto manufacturer to produce a certain percentage of each vehicle in t he United States before it could be sold here, are pending in C ongress. I believe the evidence is overwhelming that these bills, a ttractive as they may seem, would greatly harm the American e conomy, the consumer, and the flow of world trade without helping t he American auto industry in any substantial way. Local content requirements would clearly violate the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Such a violation would expose our exports in nonautomotive areas to retaliation in such forms as quotas, higher duties or local content requirements. Our studies show that our most vulnerable exports include aircraft, office equipment, electrical components, corn, wheat and soybeans. In just the first round of what could easily become a trade war, some $15 billion of exports could be affected. For every $1 billion so excluded, 25,000 American jobs would be lost. On the domestic front, the arguments are just as strong. An interagency task force on local content has done a study showing that if auto sales in the United States approached the previous alltime high by 1985 (the year local content requirements would become fully effective), local content would result in no more than 200,000 additional jobs in the auto sector. But the study also shows that the employment gains would be offset by job losses at United States assembly plants of foreign manufacturers, at foreign car dealerships and at port facilities.

Full text: Should Congress Put a 'Made in U.S.A.' Stamp on Imported Cars? Malcolm Baldrige and Douglas A. Fraser have often locked horns over issues of trade and industry. Again, the Commerce Secretary and president of the United Auto Workers union are at odds, this time over proposed legislation that would, in effect, require major foreign-car companies such as Toyota, Nissan and Volkswagen, to make most of the vehicles for the American market in this country.
Proponents bill the legislation as a way to get the domestic auto industry moving again and stop the loss of jobs in the auto sector. The Reagan Administration has raised the red flag of trade wars plus increased inflation if the local-content legislation is passed.
Specifically, the Fair Practices in Automotive Products Act would require that for auto makers selling more than 500,000 cars a year in the United States, 90 percent of parts and labor be domestic; for those selling 200,000 to 500,000, 75 percent, and for those selling 100,000 to 150,000, 25 percent.
The bill currently has 218 sponsors in the house (enough for passage), 17 sponsors in the Senate and action on the legislation is expected within a few weeks. Not surprisingly, the United States domestic auto makers, which are using more foreign parts themselves but cannot afford to alienate the U.A.W., have declined to take sides. By MALCOLM BALDRIGE SEVERAL versions of a ''local content'' bill, which would require ana uto manufacturer to produce a certain percentage of each vehicle in t he United States before it could be sold here, are pending in C ongress. I believe the evidence is overwhelming that these bills, a ttractive as they may seem, would greatly harm the American e conomy, the consumer, and the flow of world trade without helping t he American auto industry in any substantial way.
The issues raised by local content requirements are far-reaching. They go well beyond the short-term implications of the specific bills being conconsidered by Congress. They cross over industry lines and would seriously undermine the United States position in the world trading community.
Specifically, the bills would be inflationary: Car prices would go up, the auto industry's ability to seek low-cost sources of supply would be restricted, new regulatory burdens would be placed on the industry, it would be more difficult for the industry to become internationally competitive and, perhaps most important, the bills would violate international trade agreements.
In times of difficult worldwide economic conditions, shortsighted pressures to adopt protectionist-type legislation are intense. Each country finds a growing number of individuals advocating actions to protect its industries and its domestic jobs regardless of the longterm consequences.
The United States has long been recognized as the world leader in assuring a free and open trading system worldwide. Every administration since World War II has defended this principle. If local content legislation is adopted, we will indicate to our trading partners that we are abandoning that position. Our efforts to open other countries' markets would lose credibility immediately. With one of every seven manufacturing jobs and one of every three farmland acres in the country dependent on exports, key sectors of our economy would be dealt a severe blow.
Local content requirements would clearly violate the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Such a violation would expose our exports in nonautomotive areas to retaliation in such forms as quotas, higher duties or local content requirements. Our studies show that our most vulnerable exports include aircraft, office equipment, electrical components, corn, wheat and soybeans. In just the first round of what could easily become a trade war, some $15 billion of exports could be affected. For every $1 billion so excluded, 25,000 American jobs would be lost.
The legislation would also damage the Reagan Administration's efforts to obtain reciprocal trade liberalization. We have been making good progress in this area, but content legislation would be viewed as an irreversible renunciation of our position.
On the domestic front, the arguments are just as strong. An interagency task force on local content has done a study showing that if auto sales in the United States approached the previous alltime high by 1985 (the year local content requirements would become fully effective), local content would result in no more than 200,000 additional jobs in the auto sector. But the study also shows that the employment gains would be offset by job losses at United States assembly plants of foreign manufacturers, at foreign car dealerships and at port facilities.
Substantial additional losses would occur over time as our trading partners took retaliatory measures. The way to shore up our auto industry is through competition. American cars and trucks must become competitive in the world marketplace appropriately, not through legislation that artificially helps auto employment at the cost of the consumer and other industries.
Local content legislation would add to the cost of a car to the consumer. Our studies show that car prices would increase about 10 percent if local content requirements were adopted. That alone would push up the Consumer Price Index by about three-tenths of one percentage point. After the dramatic progress we have made in getting inflation down to the 5 percent to 6 percent range, we do not need laws that would push it back up.
Local content also would handcuff American auto manufacturers who would be unable to seek the lowest-cost sources of supply, placing them at a further disadvantage with their international competitors and putting further upward pressure on prices. They would be forced to purchase supplies from sources that would allow them to meet required content percentages, and would not be free to find the best product at the best price.
The problems of the United States auto industry will not be solved by enacting trade barriers. Those problems would be solved by providing an economic climate in which the United States auto companies could become more productive and competitive.
The Reagan Administration recognizes the pressures that have resulted in strong Congressional support for local content bills. We agree that action needs to be taken. We disagree only on the methods to use. Government subsidies which are obviously protectionist are not the answer.
The Administration's programs of economic incentives, regulatory relief and voluntary trade liberalization are aimed at giving both the auto industry specifically and the American industries generally the sound footing they need to do the job.

Abstract: President Reagan is seeking to defuse both issues. On the first, he is prepared to join in a study of the effectiveness of intervention in determining long-run exchange rates. The Secretary of the Treasury, Donald T. Regan, has said here that he is confident the study proposed by the United States will bear out the position of the Reagan Administration that intervention should take place only in times of extreme upheaval. But if the study finds otherwise, he adds, the United States would ''reconsider'' its policy. Appointment of Gold Panel Otmar Emminger, former president of West Germany's central bank, for instance, contends that intervention in the foreign-exchange markets for the purpose of smoothing short-run rate fluctuations is unnecessary and that speculation ordinarily does a constructive job. But Dr. Emminger, like many other Europeans, does make a case for actions by governments to keep currency rates in appropriate balance - that is, close to each currency's real market value - over the medium term and the long term. He would make a partial exception for the United States, since the world is on what can be called a ''dollar standard.'' Neglecting a Strong Dollar Virtually all the Europeans here agree that it has been a mistake for the United States to return to the policy of ''benign neglect'' of the dollar, a policy they say the Carter Administration followed at first - until the dollar plunged in 1977.

Full text: The United States is trying hard, at this eighth summit conference, to convey the message that it will go a long way to meet European criticism of its foreign-exchange and domestic economics.
The Europeans believe that, without greater United States cooperation on these issues, the world economy may be facing extreme currency instability, high interest rates, painfully slow growth and high unemployment for years to come.
The United States is not in fundamental disagreement with the objectives of its allies. But the American approach is far more noninterventionist, far more free-market oriented than the Europeans would prefer, and the sounds of sweet harmony that might emerge from this conference on goals cannot be taken at face value.
However, there is a serious likelihood that a plan will emerge from this meeting to deal with the two problems of greatest concern to the Europeans. Grappling With Two Problems
One of the problems is the great volatility of currency rates in recent months and the unwillingness of the United States until now to intervene in the foreign-exchange markets to end this volatility and keep the value of the dollar in more stable relationship with other currencies. Such stability would improve trade conditions.
The other problem is the high level of United States interest rates, which the Europeans attribute to the clash between a stimulative fiscal policy and a restrictive monetary policy in the United States. The Europeans hold high American interest rates responsible for their own high rates and underemployed economies. The high cost of financing, they maintain, has stifled investment and consumer buying.
President Reagan is seeking to defuse both issues. On the first, he is prepared to join in a study of the effectiveness of intervention in determining long-run exchange rates. The Secretary of the Treasury, Donald T. Regan, has said here that he is confident the study proposed by the United States will bear out the position of the Reagan Administration that intervention should take place only in times of extreme upheaval. But if the study finds otherwise, he adds, the United States would ''reconsider'' its policy. Appointment of Gold Panel
The Administration appears to be employing the same tactics it used successfully at home when it called for a study of returning to the gold standard in response to strong pressure from domestic advocates of gold. The appointment of the Gold Commission, with a majority of its members opposed to a revived gold standard, put an end to the gold advocates' pressure.
The issue of foreign-exchange policy, like the gold issue, is complex. There is little unity among government officials or economists in different countries on how currency stability can be achieved.
Otmar Emminger, former president of West Germany's central bank, for instance, contends that intervention in the foreign-exchange markets for the purpose of smoothing short-run rate fluctuations is unnecessary and that speculation ordinarily does a constructive job. But Dr. Emminger, like many other Europeans, does make a case for actions by governments to keep currency rates in appropriate balance - that is, close to each currency's real market value - over the medium term and the long term. He would make a partial exception for the United States, since the world is on what can be called a ''dollar standard.'' Neglecting a Strong Dollar
Virtually all the Europeans here agree that it has been a mistake for the United States to return to the policy of ''benign neglect'' of the dollar, a policy they say the Carter Administration followed at first - until the dollar plunged in 1977.
They have concluded that the Reagan Administration, like earlier Administrations in Washington, will act to stabilize the dollar if it begins to fall again.
The real motive of the Europeans in pressing the United States so hard to help stabilize the values of world currencies is that they believe a highly volatile system is disruptive of foreign trade and damaging to their economies.
While the United States is dependent on foreign trade for only about 9 percent of its gross national product, West Germany depends on foreign trade for 22 percent of its G.N.P. With smaller European countries, trade accounts for as much as 40 to 50 percent of their G.N.P.
These countries feel that a currency out of alignment with the dollar is a serious menace to their economic development in a world that operates essentially on a dollar standard.
It is for this reason that the Europeans have created the European Monetary System, a regional currency system with fixed but adjustable parities between currencies. They believe the E.M.S. has worked well - or at least well enough to hold their economies together and to avoid undue harm to any single country. Domestic Emphasis for U.S.
That the United States would come into an expanded monetary arrangement similar to the European system seems improbable. Although the European countries participating in monetary system have much in common economically, the Reagan Administration wishes to keep a free hand, since it considers the success of its domestic economic policy far more important than what happens in the foreign-exchange market or even to America's foreign trade.
Furthermore, the Reagan Administration still appears dominated by a monetarist economic theory. This theory implies that it is unnecessary to worry about foreign economic relationships, provided that one maintains a slow and steady growth of the money supply, thus keeping inflation under control. To the Europeans, this seems like a counsel of perfection that has not worked.
Yet the spirit of agreement that President Reagan and his colleagues are showing here should not be dismissed as insignificant. For it appears to represent a serious effort to promote greater international monetary cooperation and stability. The United States has many reasons of its own to get the world economy into better order. Confidence that the United States is indeed moving in this direction must await further developments at Versailles - and afterward.

Full text: The United States and France have reportedly agreed on how to begin rebuilding the international monetary system. Page 4. By SANDRA SALMANS
The concern of the United States with fighting inflation and the Western European concern with stimulating employment are expected to clash when leaders of the seven major industrialized democracies meet this week for an economic summit conference.
West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada, faced with economic stagnation and rising unemployment, plan to press President Reagan to reduce his projected budget deficit and allow interest rates to fall.
Japan may join the call. ''We would like to have American interest rates down to reasonable levels,'' said Ikusaburo Kashima, deputy division director at Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry.
Even Britain, which shares the restrictive monetary policies of the United States, will suggest ''in restrained tones'' that interest rates might be allowed to fall, one senior British official said. The Other Issues
Other issues at the annual gathering of the leaders, which begins Friday in Versailles, France, will include barriers to free trade, economic relations between the richer and poorer nations and technology transfers from industrialized to nonindustrialized societies.
Despite the stated opposition to its methods for fighting inflation, the Administration hopes to find support. ''We should all be anti-inflationary together,'' Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan said in a briefing last week, at which he called for ''closer coordination'' of various economic policies.
The United States is expected to relent in one area of monetary and economic policy: intervention by central banks in foreignexchange trading. The Reagan Administration will make ''some accommodation on exchange stability,'' Frederick Schultz, former of the Federal Reserve Board, predicted last week.
The United States has traditionally opposed such intervention, which involves the buying and selling of currencies by the central banks to keep exchange rates at levels that the governments might deem appropriate or useful in carrying out broader monetary and trade policies.
Apart from interest rates, world trade issues appear to dominate most agendas. President Reagan is expected to push for curbs on trade credits to the Communist bloc, but will be opposed by France and Germany, officials said.
There may be more unanimity on the issue of Japanese exports, which narrowly escaped attack at the previous summit conference, a year ago in Ottawa. But Japan's new package of market-opening measures, announced last week, may forestall greater restrictions by the West. The Versailles talks will be an occasion to ''sell the package,'' one Japanese official said.
Technology transfer among countries may receive more attention than at previous summit talks. But other issues once considered paramount - inflation, energy and ''North-South'' relations, between the developing and industrial nations - will be far down on the agenda. ''North-South relations will be treated lightly because no one has much to offer on that front,'' said C. Fred Bergsten, a former United States Treasury official.
The three-day meeting is the eighth such conference of the major Western allies and Japan. It will take place in a climate clouded by the war in the Falkland Islands, for which Britain has been paying a heavy price not only in lives but also in its relationship with the other members of the European Economic Community. List of the Participants
Many of the participants - Mr. Reagan, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain, President Francois Mitterrand of France, Chancellor Helmut Schmidt of Germany, Prime Minister Giovanni Spadolini of Italy, Prime Minister Zenko Suzuki of Japan and Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau of Canada, as well as the president of the European Economic Community, Gaston Thorn - were newcomers last year, and the Ottawa meeting thus emphasized communication rather than consensus on specific issues.
As at any high-level international conference, many of the policies that will ultimately be announced have already been formulated by the diplomats from the seven nations. Although the governments are now better established, no one expects much substantive progress this weekend.
''We don't expect programs to emerge from Versailles,'' said Manfred Lahnstein, West Germany's Finance Minister, ''but our performance can have a real effect on investor confidence.'' FIRST ADD AGENDA FOR SUNDAY MAIN
Following are summaries of the agendas that the major participants will take to Versailles: United States
On the thorny issue of interest rates, President Reagan is hoping only for understanding from his counterparts. But the Administration, which has consistently opposed intervention in currency markets, will propose the formation of a group to study various policies.
''We want to see the evidence,'' Treasury Secretary Regan said, adding that he would like the group to be composed of himself and the finance ministers of France, Britain, Japan and Germany.
The United States has a number of trade issues at the top of its agenda. On East-West relations, it would like the group to endorse curbs on trade credits to the Soviet Union, although President Reagan will not insist that this issue be included in a communique, officials said.
If he cannot get satisfaction on the general issue of credits, Administration officials say, the President is prepared to use all legal means to block the construction of the pipeline that the Soviet Union wants to build to bring natural gas from Siberia to Western Europe. European nations generally support the pipeline.
The President also intends to raise the issue of growing trade barriers among industrial nations, including European subsidies for farm and steel exports. A detailed discussion of protectionist measures may be deferred until the world trade talks scheduled for November, but the Administration wants a commitment to the principle of free trade.
In addition, the United States will seek endorsement of regulations governing the flow of capital across borders, to prevent nations such as Canada from restricting activity by foreign investors. Other particpants are said to be uninterested in such rules. Japan
''The handling of trade conflict is the issue of greatest concern for Japan,'' said Kasumasa Kusaka, deputy director of the general coordination division of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry.
In recent months, the perennial tension between Japan and the Western nations over persistent trade imbalances has intensified, with Tokyo coming under increasing pressure for concessions. Now Japanese officials are hoping that the package of measures to stimulate imports announced last week will deter the United States, Europe and Canada from taking new measures to restrict imports of Japanese goods.
Japan also has a stake in joining Europe and Canada, albeit discreetly, in attacking high interest rates in the United States. For one thing, the high rates keep the yen relatively weak, making exported Japanese goods cheaper and trade surpluses larger. Furthermore, Japan, partly in fear that it could become the target of wrath, would welcome anything that would distract the others from trade issues.
Japan will also join France in promoting the notion of technological cooperation as a key element in revitalizing the international economy, according to Shohei Naito, a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. No specific proposals are likely to emerge, but it is expected that a group will be formed to study such areas as robotics and bioengineering. West Germany
Chancellor Schmidt has been among the most outspoken European critics of United States interest rates and projected budget deficits, but he is resigned to the prospect that the meeting will not produce a consensus on economic policy, according to German officials.
''Schmidt has agreed not to be didactic, not to seek confrontation,'' said Horst Schulmann, the Finance Ministry official who has prepared Bonn's contribution to the conference, despite fears that continued recession in the United States will worsen Europe's economic troubles.
On the issue of foreign exchange intervention, however, Bonn hopes to win a consensus that the severe fluctuations in the markets should be eased.
Buoyed by its exports, Germany has bucked the recessionary trend better than most of its neighbors, holding down both inflation and unemployment. Accordingly, Mr. Schmidt, who has consistently denounced the growing movement toward protectionism, may join President Reagan in seeking a commitment to free trade.
In another respect, however, Germany will be on the defensive: Officials fear that its ailing neighbors will urge it to stimulate its own economy as a means of stimulating theirs. ''If the request surfaces, we will politely say no,'' Finance Minister Lahnstein said. France
As the host at Versailles, President Mitterrand has made it clear that he wants a successful and harmonious summit meeting, and France is accordingly expected to be one of the more complaisant participants.
Nevertheless, according to a high-level French official, the Government has put United States interest rates at the top of its agenda. France's 13.8 percent inflation rate is higher than that of any other nation attending the summit meeting, but France has enjoyed relatively good economic growth, and the Government is concerned that its boomlet could end unless interest rates fall and investment revives.
At the same time, the official said, France recognizes that America's high interest rates reflect a national political debate over the budget, and sympathizes with the Reagan Administration's plight.
Significantly, this official talked about the need to promote ''economic stability'' and ''economic convergence'' among the industrial nations at the summit meeting. The hope is that if France and the other nations agree to closer consultation on economic policies, the Reagan Administration will do more to stabilize the dollar.
More than most of the other participants, France wants the meeting to help expedite international cooperation in telecommunications and high technology. According to the official, France is also acutely interested in North-South issues, and thus will seek to extend the concept of economic stabilization to commodity prices. On both issues, however, France may be thwarted by the United States and others. Britain
Whatever role the Conservative Government might initially have planned to play at the summit meeting, Britain's ability to operate in diplomatic circles has been significantly reduced by the Falkland Islands war. Having sought -and for the most part received - economic sanctions against Argentina and other help from all of the countries that will be represented at Versailles, a senior official noted, Britain will be loath to take a hard line against the other participants.
But ''we shall be looking for some sort of reaffirmation of counterinflation policies,'' a senior British official said; that is ''fairly high on our agenda.''
Of the seven, only Britain will rally to Washington's side in supporting restrictive monetary and fiscal policies. At the same time, however, the British will join the others in asserting that the projected United States budget deficit is too high. The Government will express the ''hope that you would get interest rates down,'' the official said.
The British are also likelier than their European neighbors to support the United States view on East-West trade. Until recently, Britain had been among the most vocal countries on the issue of Japanese trade, arguing that Japan should loosen its fiscal purse strings and abandon its own protectionist measures if it wanted continued access to British markets. But London will press the issue only if others go along, the official said. Italy
Regarded by some as the poor cousin of the industrial nations meeting at Versailles, Italy has in fact fared better recently than some of the others. Its 10 percent inflation rate is lower than that of Canada, France or Britain, unemployment is a tolerable 9 percent, and there is slight economic growth.
But Italy is also troubled by tight monetary policy and high interest rates in the United States. Rome expresses particular concern about the recent strength of the dollar and would like to see the Reagan Administration intervene in currency markets. The growing trend toward protectionism, Italian officials say, is due partly to the dollar's strength.
Relations at Versailles between Italy and Britain may be complicated by the war in the Falkland Islands. Of the Common Market members to attend the summit meeting, only Italy has refused to impose sanctions against Argentina in retaliation for its invasion of the islands. About 40 percent of the Argentine population is of Italian descent. (Ireland, a member of the Common Market but not a summit participant, also declined to go along with the sanctions.)
North-South issues in general may be raised by Italy. ''We cannot have sustained economic growth without improving the purchasing power and well-being of the South,'' said Antonio Badini of the Prime Minister's office, who helped prepare Italy's agenda. Canada
For Canada ''to have any chance of quick recovery,'' Allan MacEachan, the Finance Minister, declared recently in the House of Commons, ''the first essential is a drop in U.S. interest rates.'' Thus, like the other leaders, Prime Minister Trudeau will present his complaint about United States policies, and may be the most outspoken.
Canada's recession has been exceptionally deep. Its unemployment rate reached 9.6 percent last month, the highest in 40 years. And unlike the United States, it cannot point to lower inflation as compensation. If an election were held tomorrow, all polls show that Mr. Trudeau's Liberals would be defeated.
On North-South issues, Canada is expected to join France in pushing for endorsement of ''global negotiations'' concerning aid to developing countries. While the Reagan Administration agreed in theory to such talks at Ottawa last year, it wants the emphasis on private investment, and discussions may become stalemated.

Abstract: Mr. [Donald T. Regan] said at a news conference afterward that ''speaker after speaker'' had complained that high United States interest rates were blocking economic recovery in the world and threatening to throw six million more people out of work in the O.E.C.D.'s 24 industrial countries, bringing their total unemployment up to 30 million by the end of the year. A Glimpse of the Future The only way for the rest of the world to bring down the cost of borrowing, encourage industrial investment and reduce unemployment, according to Mr. Regan, is to pursue ''sound economic policies'' and show ''seriousness'' in the fight against inflation. ''The process of economic revitalization must start with a credible commitment to noninflationary policy,'' Mr. Regan said in his prepared speech. The first is the fact that, although inflation in the United States has dropped sharply in the last three months to an annual rate of just 3 percent, the banks' prime rate remains near 16 percent. ''Inflation and the real rate of interest are moving in opposite directions, and that is serious,'' complained Sir Geoffrey Howe, Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer.

Full text: Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan, taking the offensive in the growing international dispute over American economic policy, warned Western finance ministers today that the lower interest rates they want in the United States ''will not be a panacea for the world's economic problems.''
Speaking on the first day of the annual ministerial meeting of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, Secretary Regan said a reduction in rates in America would not necessarily reduce borrowing costs in all other Western countries or weaken the dollar in relation to the rest of the world's currencies.
Mr. Regan said at a news conference afterward that ''speaker after speaker'' had complained that high United States interest rates were blocking economic recovery in the world and threatening to throw six million more people out of work in the O.E.C.D.'s 24 industrial countries, bringing their total unemployment up to 30 million by the end of the year. A Glimpse of the Future
But he argued that countries with continuing high inflation and large budget deficits would find their currencies staying weak against the dollar even after American interest rates come down. Thus these countries would still be forced to maintain relatively high rates, he said.
Since last August, he said, the average interest rate on United States Treasury bills has fallen more than three percentage points, while the dollar has actually strengthened, on a trade-weighted basis, by half a percentage point against the currencies of the O.E.C.D.'s other member nations.
The only way for the rest of the world to bring down the cost of borrowing, encourage industrial investment and reduce unemployment, according to Mr. Regan, is to pursue ''sound economic policies'' and show ''seriousness'' in the fight against inflation. ''The process of economic revitalization must start with a credible commitment to noninflationary policy,'' Mr. Regan said in his prepared speech.
The Treasury Secretary gave his warning at a meeting that is widely seen as a dress rehearsal for the seven-nation Western economic conference to take place next month at Versailles, outside Paris. The conference will bring together governmental heads of the United States, Britain, Canada, France, West Germany, Italy and Japan. The O.E.C.D. scheduled its ministerial meeting this year so that smaller Western nations that will not be represented at Versailles could make their concerns known in advance. Spread of Anxiety Noted
Treasury Secretary Regan said he is aware of the anxiety that high American interest rates are causing throughout the world, remarking that the Reagan Administration also wants to get them lower. The United States, with 10 million unemployed workers, now accounts for more than one-third of total O.E.C.D. unemployment, he said, while many key American industries - including auto makers, construction companies and thrift institutions - are ''in serious difficulty'' as a result of the high cost of credit.
The way to lower United States interest rates is to reduce the United States budget deficit, he said, adding that this has become ''an international necessity'' as well as a domestic one.
Concern about the depressive effect of high United States interest rates on the world economy has been sharpened in recent weeks by two separate developments, several ministers said in their speeches today.
The first is the fact that, although inflation in the United States has dropped sharply in the last three months to an annual rate of just 3 percent, the banks' prime rate remains near 16 percent. ''Inflation and the real rate of interest are moving in opposite directions, and that is serious,'' complained Sir Geoffrey Howe, Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer.
The second is a downward revision in the growth forecast issued by the O.E.C.D., which has narrowed its earlier prediction of a 1.5 percent rate of Western economic expansion this year to a mere three-tenths of 1 percent. Even the slight upturn predicted for 1983 is described by the organization's secretariat as ''technical,'' reflecting more stable oil prices and an end to the shrinking of business inventories. Inflation as Primary Target
Despite this grim outlook, Emile van Lennep, Secretary General of the O.E.C.D., said at today's news conference that he expects all of its members to stick to inflation-fighting as their top priority, a policy adopted some years ago.
But officials said the O.E.C.D. secretariat wants Germany and Japan, which have low inflation and a strong trade surplus, to abandon plans to reduce their federal budget deficits, since this would slow imports and weaken demand throughout the world.
The secretariat's recommendations are contained in new proposals for a ''differentiated'' recovery strategy that seeks to detail the contribution each O.E.C.D. member country could best make to world recovery on an individual basis.
However, both the German and Japanese ministers said today that their governments were eager to reduce public spending to make room for more private investment.

Abstract: Recalling his service as a member of President Johnson's Council of Economic Advisers during the Vietnam buildup, Mr. [Otto Eckstein] said, ''We were blamed for not raising taxes and thereby causing inflation, but the Reagan Administration expects praise for cutting taxes by 25 to 30 percent during a military buildup.'' He called this ''a really big mistake, the biggest mistake since 1932 or 1937.'' It would not be enough, he said, for the Administration to contain inflation by ''rolling back civilian nondiscretionary programs all the way to 1939, as they are proposing to do.'' The Federal Reserve's efforts to hold down the rate of growth of the money supply and thereby curb inflation in the face of big tax cuts and budget deficits, he concluded, would lead to slower real growth and persistently high unemployment by ''crowding out'' private investment. To the arguments of advocates of a rapid military buildup that the economy is slack, industry is operating at a low level of capacity, unemployment is high and there have been to date no serious shortages of critical raw materials, he responded: ''All this is, of course, true, but it fails to recognize sufficiently the highly specialized nature of most military procurement and the shortages of highly skilled labor and and specialized components required by defense industry.''

Full text: IS the military buildup planned by the Reagan Administration likely to rekindle inflation? Or, with so much slack in the economy, is there a ''window of opportunity'' for rapid military expansion?
The Reagan budget calls for military outlays to increase from $187.5 billion in the fiscal year 1982 to $221.1 billion in 1983 and to go on rising to $292 billion in 1985 and $364 billion in 1987. Economic analysts estimate that those numbers imply a real rate of increase of 9 to 10 percent in spending and an inflation rate for military goods of 10 percent.
This week, at a conference on military spending held in New York by the Center for Defense Information, Elmer B. Staats, former Comptroller General of the United States, said the relevant question was not whether the United States could afford that military buildup but whether the military program had the right priorities and whether the nation was willing to pay for it. The problem, he said, was more political than economic.
On that basis, Otto Eckstein, professor of economics at Harvard and president of Data Resources, questioned the Administration's policies for accommodating the big military buildup without imposing taxes to pay for it.
Recalling his service as a member of President Johnson's Council of Economic Advisers during the Vietnam buildup, Mr. Eckstein said, ''We were blamed for not raising taxes and thereby causing inflation, but the Reagan Administration expects praise for cutting taxes by 25 to 30 percent during a military buildup.'' He called this ''a really big mistake, the biggest mistake since 1932 or 1937.'' It would not be enough, he said, for the Administration to contain inflation by ''rolling back civilian nondiscretionary programs all the way to 1939, as they are proposing to do.''
The Federal Reserve's efforts to hold down the rate of growth of the money supply and thereby curb inflation in the face of big tax cuts and budget deficits, he concluded, would lead to slower real growth and persistently high unemployment by ''crowding out'' private investment.
But that is not an immediate problem. With manufacturing industry operating at 71 percent of capacity and unemployment at 9 percent, such Administration spokesmen as Murray L. Weidenbaum, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, have stressed the contribution rising military spending will make to the business recovery.
The pressure on resources is likely to be mitigated by the slow rate at which spending on weapons procurement flows out. Data presented by Stanley S. Fine, a retired rear admiral, to the military-spending conference indicated that outlays for ships would be only 2.4 percent of the appropriation for ships, 10.4 percent for aircraft, 14 percent for missiles and 6.3 percent for tanks.
However, with military appropriations scheduled to climb from $218.9 billion in 1982 to $291 billion in 1984 and $408.4 billion in 1987, pressures will keep climbing through the rest of this decade.
The planned military buildup in the next four years, estimates cited by Mr. Staats say, will absorb 30 percent of ''goods producing'' gross national product, up from 6 percent in the fiscal year 1981.
To the arguments of advocates of a rapid military buildup that the economy is slack, industry is operating at a low level of capacity, unemployment is high and there have been to date no serious shortages of critical raw materials, he responded: ''All this is, of course, true, but it fails to recognize sufficiently the highly specialized nature of most military procurement and the shortages of highly skilled labor and and specialized components required by defense industry.''
And he concluded that there would be even greater increases in overall prices for military procurement than in the past. Higher procurement costs of major weapons systems than budgeted could force reductions in items crucial to military readiness.
The impact of the military buildup on inflation is, however, a macroeconomic, not a microeconomic, question, depending on how the nation chooses to pay for the buildup. But to the extent that growing military outlays swell the projected budget deficits, they are likely to be inflationary and call forth tight-money policies, which are likely to curb real economic growth.
The ''window of opportunity'' for military buildup looks open right now but will close if the economy recovers. The alternative ways of paying for the military buildup, thereafter, would be higher taxes, slower growth or inflation.

U.S. INTEREST-RATE FEVER ADDS TO EUROPE'S ACHES

Abstract: Britain and its allies, the Chancellor said as he sipped a gin and tonic, have ''a legitimate interest in the success of the United States Administration in reconciling its spending obligations with its own responsible pursuit of monetary discipline.'' Lack of success, he suggested, would mean ''a risk of continuing high interest rates, which would be damaging to recovery.'' ''Even optimists should not have, over all, any illusions that the interest level in the United States could go down quickly, fundamentally and permanently,'' said Count Otto Lambsdorff, the West German economics minister after returning from Washington. ''For it seems to me that in U.S. economic policy, there is a fundamental conflict between monetary and finance policy.'' Worry in Europe about American economic policy is genuine. Interest-rate gyrations in the United States wreak havoc with European plans. Most fundamentally, foreign exchange rates have become increasingly sensitive to differences in interest rates. This has forced other countries to match increases in American rates or face the unpleasant consequences of seeing their currency depreciate. For ''open'' European economies, heavily dependent on trade, the principal consequence is more inflation as the price of imports rises. Paul A. Volcker, the Federal Reserve chairman, ''is dictating the pace of events around the world, not only as regards economic activity but also as regards inflation,'' said Paul Neild, chief economist at Phillips & Drew, a London stock brokerage. ''Many countries would be pursuing more stimulative policies if left free to do so.''

Full text: When Sir Geoffrey Howe, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, unveiled the new budget in the House of Commons last week, Britons listened carefully for news of taxes and spending. But while he had their attention, Sir Geoffrey couldn't resist tossing in a mention of the consequences of high interest rates and large budget deficits in the United States.
Britain and its allies, the Chancellor said as he sipped a gin and tonic, have ''a legitimate interest in the success of the United States Administration in reconciling its spending obligations with its own responsible pursuit of monetary discipline.'' Lack of success, he suggested, would mean ''a risk of continuing high interest rates, which would be damaging to recovery.''
By such thinly veiled warnings, senior economic officials here and on the Continent have been stating their concern over United States policy. Since President Reagan announced his new budget last month, European criticism of high rates has broadened, persisting even while American rates drifted downward during the past two weeks.
''Even optimists should not have, over all, any illusions that the interest level in the United States could go down quickly, fundamentally and permanently,'' said Count Otto Lambsdorff, the West German economics minister after returning from Washington. ''For it seems to me that in U.S. economic policy, there is a fundamental conflict between monetary and finance policy.''
Worry in Europe about American economic policy is genuine. Interest-rate gyrations in the United States wreak havoc with European plans. Most fundamentally, foreign exchange rates have become increasingly sensitive to differences in interest rates. This has forced other countries to match increases in American rates or face the unpleasant consequences of seeing their currency depreciate. For ''open'' European economies, heavily dependent on trade, the principal consequence is more inflation as the price of imports rises. Paul A. Volcker, the Federal Reserve chairman, ''is dictating the pace of events around the world, not only as regards economic activity but also as regards inflation,'' said Paul Neild, chief economist at Phillips & Drew, a London stock brokerage. ''Many countries would be pursuing more stimulative policies if left free to do so.''
Underpinning these views are serious economic difficulties. In most of Europe, including West Germany, unemployment has risen far more sharply than in the United States, to record levels. Ten days ago, the Common Market predicted that unemployment among its 10 members would rise to 12 million by the end of the year, from slightly above 10 million now.
The economic troubles have had substantial political repercussions. Last year, they helped elect Francois Mitterrand, a Socialist, as President of France. They are a prime factor in British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's low approval ratings in opinion polls and in West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt's growing difficulty in holding his coalition Government together. For Europeans, almost certainly facing tough economic problems in any event, American interest rates are a convenient whipping boy. Two weeks ago, Mr. Mitterrand said after meeting in Paris with Mr. Schmidt that tough action against American interest rates was planned. Last week, Mr. Mitterrand carried the message directly to Washington and President Reagan. But it was already clear that the threat - widely assumed to be foreign exchange controls - was unlikely to be carried out.
In recent days, concern has ebbed slightly. Europeans are mainly concerned about rates and at the moment, interest rates in the United States and the value of the dollar both seem to be declining. The fall in world oil prices has also reduced the pressure, holding out the promise of added economic growth in Europe without the necessity of stimulative policies. But officials preparing for the June economic meeting of President Reagan and six other leaders of industrial countries have been unable to agree on recommendations because of divisions over how to respond to American policy.
European governments appear increasingly prepared to go their own way, despite the American rates. Several weeks ago, West Germany, the Netherlands and Britain began cutting interest rates, even though disappointing money supply numbers in the United States had just sent American rates climbing again. Similarly, Sir Geoffrey, in last week's budget, unveiled a new monetary policy that was widely perceived to be less rigorous than the old one. The pound immediately went down in value.
In addition to economic effects, displeasure over American rates has accentuated other differences between the United States, with its conservative President, and most of Europe, with the notable exception of Britain. On big issues with economic dimensions, such as defense spending, the contractionary effects of American economic policy have made it more difficult for Europeans to cooperate. On the proposal to build a natural gas pipeline from the Soviet Union to Western Europe and for other restrictions on East-West trade, French and West German willingness to heed American pleas has been diminished because both countries export substantially more to Eastern Europe than the United States does. Common Market ministers last week decided to reduce the sanctions against Moscow they had discussed after the crackdown in Poland.
Similarly, with budget deficits swollen by recession, European nations have had difficulty meeting the commitment to increase defense spending by 3 percent in real terms, above inflation; only Britain has come close to succeeding. Sir Geoffrey proposed an 11.6 percent rise in defense spending next year, with inflation projected at 9 percent.
To be sure, the European attitude sometimes defies logic. When Jimmy Carter was President, European leaders led by Mr. Schmidt regularly lectured the United States on the need to tighten its monetary policy. Now, it is precisely this tightening that is upsetting them.

GOLD COIN FAVORED BY U.S. BOARD

Abstract: The United States Gold Commission today completed all but the final details of its recommendations to Congress. The recommendations reject a gold standard for the United States, while favoring the minting of a new gold ''coin'' that would be sold at the market value of its gold content but would not be used as currency. Mr. [Henry S. Reuss] said today that the gold coin ''was what the gold lobby really wanted all the time.''

Full text: The United States Gold Commission today completed all but the final details of its recommendations to Congress. The recommendations reject a gold standard for the United States, while favoring the minting of a new gold ''coin'' that would be sold at the market value of its gold content but would not be used as currency.
The session today will be the last for the 17-member commission unless significant new arguments arise in the final drafting of its report, which is due on Capitol Hill March 31. The Presidential commission last year began to study the controversial issue of tying the value of the dollar to the value of gold and to submit its recommendations to Congress.
In votes taken last month, the commission rejected, 15 to 2, a resolution that would have permitted the conversion of paper currency to gold, something that has not been possible in the United States since 1933. Sold for Gold Content
By a 12-to-3 vote, the commission had recommended the minting of a new gold coin that would be sold by the Treasury for its gold content, probably in half-ounce and one-ounce sizes. The coin, called the American Eagle, would be sold as an alternative to gold coins offered as investments by Mexico, Canada, South Africa and other countries.
The investment in American Eagles would keep dollars invested in gold from leaving the country. The coin would be similar to the gold medallion that the Government has had trouble selling since it was created in 1980, although the coin - unlike the medallion - would be exempt from capital gains and sales taxes.
One commisssion member, Representative Henry S. Reuss, a Wisconsin Democrat, made several unsuccessful attempts today to have the group retract or water down the gold-coin recommendation.
Mr. Reuss noted that 30 members of the House Banking Committee, a solid majority, had signed a letter opposing the coin proposal. Opposition Rejected
But a commission member, Ron Paul, a Texas Republican who, like Mr. Reuss, is also a member of the Banking Committee, said, ''I think we should totally ignore the recommendation of Congress to the commission'' on what commission members should recommend to the Congress.
Congress voted in 1980 to create the commission, and President Reagan appointed seven senators and representatives, three of his own advisers, three Federal Reserve governors and four private citizens as members last June.
Mr. Reuss said today that the gold coin ''was what the gold lobby really wanted all the time.'' Creation of the commission led to considerable public discussion about the possibility of the United States returning to some form of a gold standard, such as requiring that a percentage of all paper money be backed with gold. Some of the President's advisers have favored a gold standard as a means of controlling inflation.

Abstract: In the latest issue of the Quarterly Review of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, Thomas J. Sargent and Neil Wallace, the bank's leading monetary economists, offer what they call ''Some Unpleasant Monetarist Arithmetic'' to demonstrate that, although tight money in the face of a loose fiscal policy may work temporarily to reduce inflation, it eventually leads to higher inflation. Using a quantitative model, Mr. Sargent and Mr. Wallace reach the spectacular conclusion that, given the Government deficit that needs to be financed, looser money will produce less inflation than tight money.The reason is that tight money will put the economy into deeper recession and choke back longer-term growth, swelling the budget deficits and necessitating greater issuance of Government bonds and greater money creation, and hence causing greater inflation. This striking result depends on two crucial assumptions. The first is that the real rate of interest (the nominal level of interest rates minus the rate of inflation) exceeds the growth rate of the economy. At present, that assumption applies. The second crucial assumption is that the path of fiscal policy does not depend on present or futu re monetary policies. With the Administration setting its own budge t and tax course undeterred by the Fed's planned path of monetary g rowth, that assumption also appears to hold.

Full text: THE prospects for the American economy in 1982 are growing increasingly dismal. The securities markets have weakened, reflecting anxieties over rising interest rates. The Administration's policy makers have insisted that interest rates would come down with inflation, but the markets do not believe it. They foresee pressures on rates intensifying as the Government plans for growing budget deficits three years ahead - deficits that were supposed not to happen, as faster growth threw off enough additional revenue to pay for the big tax cuts.
At the same time, unemployment is climbing faster than expected. The jobless rate, which was 7.4 percent when Ronald Reagan took office, reached 8.9 percent in December, and could hit 10 percent in the months ahead.
Is the Reagan Administration's effort to combine monetarism - tight control of the money supply - with so-called supply-side tax cuts and climbing military spending proving a failure? Or is the weak performance of the economy simply the price for bringing inflation down and establishing conditions for steady growth?
The monetarists within the Administration and at the Federal Reserve Board, headed by Paul A. Volcker, are clinging to the hope that tight money will beat inflation and inflationary expectations out of the system. But some economists within the Federal Reserve System have begun to voice sharply dissenting views about the wisdom of trying to use tight money to stop inflation in the face of the huge looming Federal budget deficits.
In the latest issue of the Quarterly Review of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, Thomas J. Sargent and Neil Wallace, the bank's leading monetary economists, offer what they call ''Some Unpleasant Monetarist Arithmetic'' to demonstrate that, although tight money in the face of a loose fiscal policy may work temporarily to reduce inflation, it eventually leads to higher inflation.
In fact, they say, if individuals and corporations expect future inflation because of coming big budget deficits and base their monetary demands and actions on those expectations, tighter money will do little to check inflation even temporarily.
To be sure, if money is held tightly enough to dump the economy into recession, as it now has, the slump may cause a temporary decline in inflation. But the economists beli eve that sooner or laterthe necessity of financing huge deficits is l ikely to breed greater inflation.
The critical issue, they contend, is whether fiscal policy dominates monetary policy or vice versa. At present, they see the fiscal policy of the Reagan Administration dominating the Fed's monetary policy.By independently laying down its budget and deficit plans, the Administration determines how much money will have to be raised through the public sale of interest-bearing Government bonds and through seigniorage -revenue raised by money creation.
Using a quantitative model, Mr. Sargent and Mr. Wallace reach the spectacular conclusion that, given the Government deficit that needs to be financed, looser money will produce less inflation than tight money.The reason is that tight money will put the economy into deeper recession and choke back longer-term growth, swelling the budget deficits and necessitating greater issuance of Government bonds and greater money creation, and hence causing greater inflation.
This striking result depends on two crucial assumptions. The first is that the real rate of interest (the nominal level of interest rates minus the rate of inflation) exceeds the growth rate of the economy. At present, that assumption applies. The second crucial assumption is that the path of fiscal policy does not depend on present or futu re monetary policies. With the Administration setting its own budge t and tax course undeterred by the Fed's planned path of monetary g rowth, that assumption also appears to hold.
The Sargent-Wallace study does not deny the possibility that monetary policy could permanently affect the inflation rate under a monetary regime that effectively disciplined the fiscal authority, but such a regime does not exist in the United States now.
The faltering growth of the American economy, rising unemployment and persistently high interest rates, especially on long-term securities, disclose stubborn inflationary expectations and raise grave doubts about whether monetarism, combined with big budget deficits, will work any better in Ronald Reagan's America than it has in Margaret Thatcher's Britain.

CAN WE INDEX OUR WAY OUT OF INFLATION?

Publication info: New York Times , Late Edition (East Coast); New York, N.Y. [New York, N.Y]16 Nov 1981: A.22.

Abstract: First, given a current inflation rate of about 10 percent, it is inconceivable that nominal rates of interest can fall to 3 to 6 percent today as they claim, even if inflation risk disappears from the lenders' point of view. The best that can be hoped for is that lenders will not charge a premium over and above the anticipated rate of inflation for the inflation risk they would bear with non-indexed contracts.

Full text: T o the Editor: Professors Robert Heilbroner and Adolph Lowe do not seem to have taken account of the full implications of their proposal to index loan contracts to an appropriate price index (letter Nov. 4).
First, given a current inflation rate of about 10 percent, it is inconceivable that nominal rates of interest can fall to 3 to 6 percent today as they claim, even if inflation risk disappears from the lenders' point of view. The best that can be hoped for is that lenders will not charge a premium over and above the anticipated rate of inflation for the inflation risk they would bear with non-indexed contracts.
Second, indexation simply shifts the inflation risk from the lender to the borrower. For instance, the issue of such indexed instruments in the housing market in prior years would have prevented the financial crisis many savings and loan associations face today, but by the same token would have increased the number of bankruptcies of households unable to meet rapidly escalating mortgage obligations.
It may be argued that the social cost of insuring against the failure of the financial institutions (the lenders) through the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is lower than that associated with the obvious disruptions caused by a large number of personal bankruptcies. The experience in Britain where quasi-index-linked contracts have been prevalent in the housing market for several years has not been as positive as Professors Heilbroner and Lowe suggest. In the face of the borrowers' inability to pay higher interest costs, lenders were simply forced to reschedule the payments due them.
Finally, the ability of business borrowers to pass on their increased costs to their customers varies from industry to industry, so that revenues do not necessarily keep pace with inflated costs. Since movements in the prices of various goods do not closely mirror the changes in the aggregate price index, it is risky for an individual firm to write such indexed contracts. The reluctance of business firms in most countries to issue index-linked contracts in the past is indirect evidence of their unwillingness to bear the risk of inflation.
Index-linked loan contracts are certainly a valuable addition to the available range of financial instruments, since they permit a different allocation of inflation risk between borrowers and lenders than is currently feasible. However, to recommend them as a panacea to cure all the ills of inflation is certainly overstating the case in their favor. MARTI G. SUBRAHMANYAM Chairman, Finance Graduate School of Business New York University New York, Nov. 6, 1981

Full text: The Reagan Administration's military buildup could contribute to inflation ''in the very short run,'' but it was not expected to have a major effect on consumer prices, Murray L. Weidenbaum, the chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, said today.
Defense spending can contribute to inflationary pressures ''when prices in the economy are slow to adjust to a relative shift in the economy's pattern of demand away from civilian products and toward defense production,'' Mr. Weidenbaum told a Congressional joint economic subcommittee.
That happens primarily when ''overly rapid and unforeseen growth in defense requirements creates bottlenecks in the supplying industries,'' he said.
But while the Administration's military program is a major one, Mr. Weidenbaum added, ''it is a long-term expansion and can be foreseen and planned for in the private sector.'' He said, ''Thus, I believe the dangers on this score have been overstated.''
Mr. Weidenbaum said that despite the military buildup, outlays by the Defense Department were projected to rise only from 5.5 percent of the gross national product in the fiscal year 1981, to 7 percent in the fiscal year 1986.
By contrast, he said, military spending accounted for 8.6 percent of the G.N.P. in 1962 and 9 percent in 1968, the peak year of American involvement in the Vietnam War.

Abstract: Nor is the obstacle any lag in demand: Conversion of oil-burning facilities to coal and creation of new coal burning facilities is proceeding so rapidly in Western Europe and Japan that demand for coal imports by these regions is expected to increase fourfold from 1979 to 1990. Despite present softness of the coal spot market in Europe, a very substantial long-term increase in demand remains likely. THE obstacl e to increased coal trade lies in artificial restraints in the coal e xporting nations: Unstable conditions in Poland, which have reduced its coal output; fear of interracial strife in the future and an equivocal government policy in the past, which have made importer s reluctant to rely unduly on South Africa; periodic labor difficu lties in Australia, reflected in last year's strike, andinadequate po rt facilities in the United States, which have provoked bitter compla ints from our trading partners. The problems in Poland, South Africa, and A ustralia are not susceptible to rapid resolution. So the Unite d States will remain a key residual supplier - the more so since mos t coal importers are anxious to diversify their sources of supply in order to reduce theirvulnerability to untoward events in other cou ntries. The United States role is so large as to make it unlikel y that world coal trade will be doubled unless restraints on that rol e created by inadequate ports are overcome. * There is the longer-term problem of channel depths. Even if the improvements in coal loading and storage facilities described above are achieved, United States coal ports will remain inadequate, because European and Japanese coal importers want to shift some of their coal commerce from the present Panamax 60,000-ton ships to larger ships (100,000 tons and over), which can transport coal more economically. Present water depths in most world coal ports are too shallow to take these ships. Steps are being taken to remedy this condition in some European, Australian, and South African ports, but not in the United States.

Full text: I F the dredging of channels in a few United States ports is not begun in the next several years, American efforts to beat stagflation will be significantly hampered. To say that this connection is not widely appreciated would be a vast understatement. But the connection is there, and unless we take account of it, we will suffer.
The 1970's showed that sharply rising oil prices meant more inflation and less economic growth in the industrial countries. Oil prices are no longer rising steeply, in part because these countries have reacted to higher prices by reducing their oil consumption and increasing their use of alternative energy sources.
The most important of these alternatives is coal. When the leaders of the seven main industrial countries met at the 1980 economic summit conference in Venice, they pledged their countries to double coal trade in the coming decade. Whether this pledge is fulfilled will do much to determine whether the present relative stability of oil prices continues, or fades away as the current recession wanes and unforeseen interruptions in oil supply occur.
The obstacle to doubling coal trade is not lack of supply in the main exporting countries: The United States, Australia, Poland, and South Africa have sufficient reserves to increase enormously their production of coal for sale abroad.
Nor is the obstacle any lag in demand: Conversion of oil-burning facilities to coal and creation of new coal burning facilities is proceeding so rapidly in Western Europe and Japan that demand for coal imports by these regions is expected to increase fourfold from 1979 to 1990. Despite present softness of the coal spot market in Europe, a very substantial long-term increase in demand remains likely. THE obstacl e to increased coal trade lies in artificial restraints in the coal e xporting nations: Unstable conditions in Poland, which have reduced its coal output; fear of interracial strife in the future and an equivocal government policy in the past, which have made importer s reluctant to rely unduly on South Africa; periodic labor difficu lties in Australia, reflected in last year's strike, andinadequate po rt facilities in the United States, which have provoked bitter compla ints from our trading partners. The problems in Poland, South Africa, and A ustralia are not susceptible to rapid resolution. So the Unite d States will remain a key residual supplier - the more so since mos t coal importers are anxious to diversify their sources of supply in order to reduce theirvulnerability to untoward events in other cou ntries. The United States role is so large as to make it unlikel y that world coal trade will be doubled unless restraints on that rol e created by inadequate ports are overcome.
There is a good deal of misunderstanding about these restraints. Three separate problems need to be distinguished from each other:
* There are the short-term problems of adjustment that caused large numbers of European ships to wait long periods to load coal at United States East Coast ports last spring. These problems have been eased not only by the end of the Australian strike but also by innovative procedures that have made it possible to schedule waiting ships at our East Coast ports more efficiently and by increased coal exports from our Gulf Coast ports.
* There is the medium-term problem of structural change: United States coal loading and storage port facilities were designed for lesser amounts than must now be moved, and were designed primarily for metallurgical coal, rather than the steam coal that is now in growing demand abroad. So these facilities must be expanded and modernized. The private companies that own the piers and the relevant port authorities are taking effective steps to these ends.
* There is the longer-term problem of channel depths. Even if the improvements in coal loading and storage facilities described above are achieved, United States coal ports will remain inadequate, because European and Japanese coal importers want to shift some of their coal commerce from the present Panamax 60,000-ton ships to larger ships (100,000 tons and over), which can transport coal more economically. Present water depths in most world coal ports are too shallow to take these ships. Steps are being taken to remedy this condition in some European, Australian, and South African ports, but not in the United States.
This United States lag is due to a legislative problem: The Administration has concluded that dredging should not and cannot, in present budgetary circumstances, be financed by the Federal Government. This means that a bill will have to be passed by the Congress defining how this function is to be transferred to the states and local authorities. And it has proved damnably difficult to get Congressional agreement on such a bill. Many coastal states are involved, and their immediate interests and financial capabilities differ.
Until it is clear that a few United States coal ports will be dredged, some European and Japanese coal importers will be reluctant to sign long-term contracts to buy greatly increased amounts of American coal. In the absence of such contracts, some American companies will be reluctant to make the long-term investments needed to fulfill United States coal export potential. This will not only limit world coal trade but also hurt those Americans who make their living producing and transporting coal.
The Administration is cutting red tape on dredging. Legislative action in the next 12 months is also needed, and is feasible. But this will require that two things occur:
* That the Administration take the lead in seeking legislative consensus.
* That public demand for port dredging be felt, making it easier for the members of Congress principally concerned to compromise. Failing this, the great United States export coal boom that people talk about for the 1980's will turn out like the great United States domestic coal boom that people used to talk about for the 1970's - a dazzling vision that is only partially reflected in expanded sales of the hard black stuff that substitutes for oil.
Without a United States coal export boom, the link between oil consumption and economic growth in the industrial world will not be broken - a link that condemns us to recurring inflation and low growth, whenever the balance between oil demand and supply tilts, as it may periodically, against the oil importing nations.
There is an excellent chance of solving our coal port problem. But only if a lot more public attention is paid to it than is now the case. --------------------------------------------------------------------- Henry Owen, w ho was in charge of the White House coordination for President Car ter at the London, Bonn, Tokyo and Venice economic summit meetin gs, is with the Consultants International Group in Washington.

NOW IT'S DEFENSE VS. THE DEFICIT President Reagan in March and September 1981 (p.24)

Abstract: Thus, [David A. Stockman] is on a collision course with Secretary of Defense Caspar W.

Full text: At first, it seemed that the moment of truth for President Reagan was at hand. He had pushed his huge budget and tax cuts through the Congress in early August and gone off to vacation in California. But the latent conflict over the rapidly growing defense budget reared up behind him.
The financial community and the president's own economic advisers, led by David A. Stockman, director of the Office of Management and Budget, told him he couldn't do both. Stockman said that another $75 billion at least would have to come out of the budget in 1983 and 1984 to reach the 1984 balanced budget, and he urged that much of it come from defense - the only part of the budget that had been singled out for substantial increases.
The signals from investors could not be clearer. Both bond and stock prices have been plunging, and the euphoria of the budget and tax cut victories has been lost in uneasiness over the economy. Essentially, Wall Street wants an indication that the Reagan administration is serious about dealing with inflation by restraining government borrowing and thus the ever rising budget deficits.
Thus, Stockman is on a collision course with Secretary of Defense Caspar W. Weinberger, who held Stockman's job under former President Nixon and earned the sobriquet ''Cap the Knife.'' Today, charged with the task of meeting Reagan's military objectives, he has become ''Cap the Warrior.''
Aligned behind Stockman are two other White House colleagues, the chief of staff, James A. Baker 3d, and the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, Murray L. Weidenbaum.
On Weinberger's side stands Deputy Secretary of Defense Frank C. Carlucci, who has the best command of the military budget in the Pentagon - and Secretary of State Alexander M . Haig Jr., although whatever help Haig has given the defense secr etary, with whom he has had repeated differences, has been largely be hind the scenes.
Edwin Meese 3d, the influential presidential counselor, has kept his own counsel in this case. The wrangling has now gone public. After the president got back to the White House for a series of meetings on the budget last week, he faced some complicated choices: Slow the increase in military spending, cut deeper into the social welfare and domestic programs, accept a continuing deficit. As the smok e and dust of the squabbling began to clear by the end of the week, the president appeared to be moving toward a compromise.It would invo lve a hold-down of $5 billion to $30 billion in the 1983 and 1984 defense budget increases; what one official called ''a massive savin g'' of up to $45 billion in the nondefense budgets; a small deficit of around $10 billion in the 1984 Federal budget, and $3 billion in new revenues from user taxes.
The rhetoric of the debate on defense has been misleading. Headlines speak of ''cuts,'' but there would be no actual cuts - just reductions in the president's projected increases. Such reductions still represent a painful shift for the Reagan administration. In January, Weinberger and other senior officials said that military needs, not the budget, would drive military spending. However, more recently, Henry E. Catto, the Pentagon's chief spokesman, told reporters, ''The original projections are now being revised. I think it fair to say that this is a look in the light of new realities.''
Important as the shift strikes the government, investors as yet seem unimpressed. ''What Wall Street is looking for is a credible anti-inflation policy on the part of the Reagan administration,'' Gary Wenglowski, economist for Goldman, Sachs & Company, said. ''This is a Republican administation, yet the deficits are larger than the Carter deficits - $60 billion to $65 billion this year and about the same next year. And investors fear that it will be too politically unpopular for Reagan to say 'no' to inflation.''
Wenglowski added that Wall Street will be looking primarily at the deficit in fiscal year 1982. ''Reagan has to show a break in the deficit trend, starting in 1982,'' he said. ''Projections of 1984 do not mean anything.''
Alan Benasuli, aerospace analyst for Drexel Burnham Lambert, the New York brokerage house, said he thought the president would probably reduce the 1982 military budget to $205 billion to $210 billion with 4 to 5 percent real annual growth, from the current projected level of $222 billion with 7 percent growth. ''That will come to about $20 billion to $30 billion in cuts, which is 40 percent of the necessary cuts,'' Benasuli said. ''He's not going to have any problem getting those through Congress. He will just have to persuade his conservative backers.''
At this point, it is unclear just where the military budget cuts will be made. There are several ways of looking at the complicated budget, one of which is by category of appropriation. The $222 billion budget for 1982, for example, includes $43.8 billion for personnel and another $15.4 billion for retired service people; $64.1 billion to operate, train and maintain the forces; $68.5 billion to procure weapons and equipment; $21.7 billion for research and development of new weapons and equipment, and $8.1 billion for construction of military facilities and housing.
Put another way, the same budget can be broken down into $89.5 billion for general purpose, or conventional forces; $41 billion for training, medical and other personnel activities; $20.1 billion for central supply and maintenance; $18.5 billion for research and development; $17.4 billion for strategic, or nuclear forces; $14.5 billion for intelligence and communications; $11.3 billion for national guard and reserve forces; $4.4 billion for air and sea lift; $4.2 billion for administration, and $1.3 billion to support other nations.
Adminstration officials said the president had exempted cuts in strategic nuclear weapons and hardware, which would involve companies such as Martin Marietta in its work on the MX missile, Rockwell International and other makers of strategic bombers. But the budget issue has again set back basic decisions on how to improve the nuclear deterrent, so that those companies have little assurance of what may be coming their way. Manufacturers of conventional weapons are even more uncertain.
The immediate future depends not only on how much Reagan decides to trim out of the projected military budget but also on the military priorities set by him and Weinberger. Holding down the expansion of the Navy, for instance, could affect shipbuilders such as Newport News, Litton, Bath Iron Works, Todd Shipyards and Electric Boat, plus makers of naval aircraft such as Grumman.
If the decision were to delay an expansion of ground forces, then Chrysler, Hughes, Sikorsky and Raytheon might not get expected orders. Scrapping Air Force expansion plans could chew into General Dynamics or McDonnell Douglas. Cutting down on operations and tra ining might mean less buying of petroleum products from Motor Oil Hellas, Exxon, Standard of California and Tex aco.
Wall Street analysts seem to agree that the cuts would come primarily in the conventional force weapons, in the form or reducing orders for such systems as General Dynamics's F-16 fighter plane and the M-1 tank, for which the Chrysler Corp. is the prime contractor.
''Fairchild Industries' A-10 attack plane is a good example,'' said Benasuli of Drexel Burnham. ' 'Under the Carter budget, it would have ended in April 1983. Reagan reinstated the program with orders for 60 planes . If we go back to no planes at all, then Fairchild has a problem.''
Analysts also see few cuts coming on the personnel side. ''Funding for hardware is scheduled to rise 93.8 percent over two years,'' said Wolfgang Demisch, aerospace analyst with Morgan Stanley & Company. ''It's going to be a lot easier to cut there then to cut back on personnel, which is politically sensitive.''
Representatives of defense contractors in Washington have been noticeably silent during the Administration's struggle with the military budget. ''We're hunkered down waiting to see what's going to happen,'' one said. ''We honestly don't know what's going to be cut, or even if anything is going to be cut.''
One area the White House will not cut seems to be the promised pay increase. Officials have said that the administration would continue to seek the 14.3 percent raise, effective Oct. 1. That would have considerable positive effect on the economies of communities around military bases. But the officials said that planned increases in the size of the force and in civilian employees were not at all guaranteed.
A long-time analyst chuckled about what had happened. ''Jimmy Carter fed us all that baloney in 1976 about how he was going to cut $5 billion to $7 billion from the defense budget, but when he got here, he was confronted with military reality,'' he said, referring to the Soviet buildup and invasion of Afghanistan and the long crisis over the American hostages in Iran. ''Then Ronald Reagan fed us all that baloney in 1980 about how he would go full steam ahead to rearm America. When he got into office, he came face-to-face with economic reality.''
Weinberger himself is a study in contrasts. Although he is softspoken, congenial and humorous, a careful reading of his words suggests that he is the toughest in Reagan's flight of hawks.
While the numbers in the argument between Stockman and Weinberger sound enormous, the contention is actually over about 5 percent of the military budget. Part of the 5 percent reduction had already been built in and was there waiting to be taken if needed. As the 1983 budget was being drawn up during the summer, the OMB directed the Pentagon to identify a series of 5 percent cuts that could be made if needed to help balance the budget.
Those cuts were primarily in the procurement of weapons and other hardware. With that as a starting point, the Pentagon was instructed to identify other possible cuts in costs of manpower, operations, training, maintenance and research and development.
The main point of attack, once Reagan decides where the cuts are to be made, will be the 1982 appropriations bills that have barely started their way through Congress. Small savings in fiscal 1982, which starts Oct. 1, are possible, according to Administration officials, but the real slowdown would come in 1983 and 1984, when actual outlays would be made. The administration then intends to reinforce that by holding down the growth of military budgets that are authorized for 1983 and 1984, they said. Some officials suggested that $3 billion would be saved in 1982, $11 billion in 1983, and $16 billion in 1984 to arrive at the $30 billion target.
While much of the comment recently has emphasized the battle between the OMB and the Defense Department, they haven't been all that far apart. OMB supported the small increase in the additions the Reagan administration made to Carter's 1981 military budget and the $25.8 billion amendment to the 1982 budget to bring it up to $222 billion. It also approved projections announced last March that would have the Congress authorize $1.46 trillion in military budgets through 1986, with another $412 billion in 1987.
At the same time, Weinberger and Carlucci reorganized the Pentagon's strategic planning and budget programming process, seeking to reduce the adversarial nature of the dealings within the department and between the department and the OMB. Stockman's associate director for national security, William Schneider, was given a seat at the table and a vote in the deliberations of the Defense Review Board. It has become the Pentagon's executive committee and is headed by Carlucci.
The OMB and the Pentagon have adopted what one official called ''a no-surprises policy.'' All issues are fought out at the Review Board. Pentagon officials have forsaken end-runs to the President, and the OMB has promised not to seek previously unmentioned cuts when the budget comes across the Potomac River to its offices in the old Executive Office Building.
While neither civilian officials nor military officers are happy over the prospect of not getting all they thought they would, no one has suggested that the Republic would fall if the trims are

Abstract: Some of the service program managers have tried to pad their programs with ''gold watches,'' or items inserted so that they could be cut with little pain, the officials said. But they said there had been less of that than expected and most of it would be trimmed out before the program was approved. Budget officials have contended that inflation in the Defense Department's budget has risen at about the same rate as that in the rest of the Federal budget, except for fuel costs and personnel compensation, which run on their own tracks. Pentagon officials have argued that the inflation rate has been unrealistically low and thus they have had to cut the numbers of weapons they could buy. Thus, if a well-managed program had experienced only 2 percent growth in costs because of inflation, its new budget would have a 2 percent inflation factor. A program in which inflation had run to 10 percent might be assigned that inflation factor but would also be closely scrutinized for possible poor management, the officials said.

Full text: The Reagan Administration has instructed the military services to identify in their 1983 budget proposals a series of 5 percent cuts that might be made if needed to keep the Federal Government headed toward balancing the budget in 1984.
Senior Administration officials said that the 7 percent annual growth rate in military spending set by President Reagan and Secretary of Defense Caspar W. Weinberger remained policy for now, but was not sacred and could be cut if the Administration's economic assumptions proved mistaken.
The officials also disclosed a new approach to the perennial problem of assigning an inflation factor to military budgets. Instead of applying it across the board, they said, more realistic rates would be applied to each large program.
Guidance Given by White House
Further, the officials said they were looking for ways to hold down the military budget by seeking less costly military tactics and operations and by finding more efficient ways to recruit, train and retain manpower.
The budget for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, 1982, will be the first budget on which the Administration can make its own full imprint, since the changes in the budgets for the fiscal years 1981 and 1982 were only revisions of the Carter Administration's final budgets.
The Administration has given its basic guidance to the military services, and they have been preparing responses on the weapons, equipment, supplies and other programs they consider necessary to execute the Administration's policy. Programs Facing Review
Those programs, the officials said, must stay within the fiscal guideline set by the Administration, which is basically a 7 percent growth after accounting for inflation. Those programs are scheduled for review in the Pentagon in August and in the White House in September and October before being folded into the Federal budget to be presented to Congress in January.
The 5 percent reductions in the military budgets amount to a safety net for balancing the budget in 1984, and they could also be invoked, officials said, if inflation failed to come down to targets set by the Administration.
Each of the military services, the officials said, has been instructed to identify low-priority programs now so that there will be no surprises later if the cuts have to be imposed. Padding of Some Programs
The officials also said that the cuts would be made in entire segments of programs, not by stretching out purchases of hardware, as was the case in earlier budget cutting. To reduce the number of tanks bought in a year, for instance, would increase the unit cost and thus dilute an effort that Mr. Weinberger has emphasized.
Some of the service program managers have tried to pad their programs with ''gold watches,'' or items inserted so that they could be cut with little pain, the officials said. But they said there had been less of that than expected and most of it would be trimmed out before the program was approved.
The rate of inflation to be assigned to the military budget has long been a source of contention between the Defense Department and the White House's Office of Management and Budget, which sets the rate for the entire executive branch of the Government. Inflation at Comparative Rate
Budget officials have contended that inflation in the Defense Department's budget has risen at about the same rate as that in the rest of the Federal budget, except for fuel costs and personnel compensation, which run on their own tracks. Pentagon officials have argued that the inflation rate has been unrealistically low and thus they have had to cut the numbers of weapons they could buy.
Administration officials said that an effort would be made to reconcile that dispute by applying different rates of inflation to each program. Those rates would be based, they said, on experience with inflation in the recent past.
Thus, if a well-managed program had experienced only 2 percent growth in costs because of inflation, its new budget would have a 2 percent inflation factor. A program in which inflation had run to 10 percent might be assigned that inflation factor but would also be closely scrutinized for possible poor management, the officials said. Cutting Cost of Tactics
The Administration officials said that most efforts to reduce military spending in the past had been directed at the cost of hardware. They said that they intended to take a new look at tactics, to see whether military operations might not be just as effective but less expensive.
They said, for instance, that the American tendency was to mass tactical aircraft for heavy aerial strikes while allied air forces depended more on deception, low-level flying and less costly munitions.
On manpower, the officials said that long-term enlistments were under study in an effort to cut recruiting and training costs and to increase productivity by keeping experienced people in the services longer.
They also said they were studying the expansion of munitions plants as a possibly cheaper way of preparing for a long war without having to manufacture ammunition and store it now.

Abstract: Mr. [Helmut Schmidt] said Government spending was being reduced because ''in the foreseeable future, for months, and well into 1982'' no decline in international interest rates could be expected because of the high rates in the United States. Minister Asked 10% Increase He said it was unlikely that any alliance member, except the United States, would meet the pledge next year. ''We cannot compete with that,'' he added, ''We're suffering from high American interest rates. We didn't invent this high interest rate policy.'' To compete with American banks for investor capital, Western Europe's credit institutions have had to raise their lending rates, causing a falloff in business investment that is prolonging the recession. In the absence of lower United States rates, Mr. Schmidt said last week in Ottawa, West Germany's only recourse is to relieve pressure on capital markets by reducing Government borrowing through spending cuts.

Full text: The West German Cabinet today approved a rough outline for the 1982 budget that foresees a possible drop in military spending after inflation is accounted for. Chancellor Helmut Schmidt attributed the decline to the impact of high interest rates in the United States.
The Chancellor, announcing the budget figures at a news conference after an all-day Cabinet session, said the Defense Ministry budget would increase by 4.2 percent, roughly equal to the overall budget rise. If 5 to 6 percent inflation is subtracted, the real change in military spending could be a cut by as much as 1.8 percent.
Mr. Schmidt said Government spending was being reduced because ''in the foreseeable future, for months, and well into 1982'' no decline in international interest rates could be expected because of the high rates in the United States. Minister Asked 10% Increase
The 1981 military budget was $16.2 billion. Defense Minister Hans Apel originally asked for an increase of $1.6 billion, but only $696 million was approved.
The decision on military spending was one of the few firm elements to emerge from the Cabinet meeting, which was originally intended to produce an full-fledged austerity program aimed at reducing Government borrowing and relieving pressure on capital markets.
Mr. Schmidt, who seemed relaxed and good-humored despite the strains of two days of difficult talks, said total spending would increase by 4.3 percent, to $98.7 billion, reducing borrowing to $10.8 billion from $14.7 billion this year.
He said circumstances had changed since West Germany pledged, in 1978, together with its partners in the Atlantic alliance, to make efforts to increase military spending by 3 percent annually through 1986.
He said it was unlikely that any alliance member, except the United States, would meet the pledge next year. ''We cannot compete with that,'' he added, ''We're suffering from high American interest rates. We didn't invent this high interest rate policy.''
To compete with American banks for investor capital, Western Europe's credit institutions have had to raise their lending rates, causing a falloff in business investment that is prolonging the recession. In the absence of lower United States rates, Mr. Schmidt said last week in Ottawa, West Germany's only recourse is to relieve pressure on capital markets by reducing Government borrowing through spending cuts.
The budget announcement represented at best an incomplete victory for Mr. Schmidt on the fiscal front. He had hoped for a clear-cut program to be announced today, but is caught between forces in his own Social Democratic Party that favor increased taxes and Government pump-priming to relieve the economy, and the Free Democrats, the junior partner in his coalition, who favor cuts in social security spending to foster business investment. Legislation Must Be Drafted
Much of the saving announced today depends on the passage of enabling legislation, still to be approved by the coalition partners and the Cabinet.
The left wing of Mr. Schmidt's party favors a plan for an income and withholding surtax to finance an economic program. A decision on the surtax, which is opposed by the Free Democrats, has been put off until September.
Business leaders expressed disappointment with the budget. The disappointment seemed reflected in the Frankfurt currency market, where the dollar reached a level of 2.4683 marks, the highest level since September 1976.
Military officials have played down the possible effects of the spending cuts, contending that the measure in dollars alone does not accurately reflect military preparedness. ---- No Comment From Pentagon Special to the New York Times
WASHINGTON, July 30 - A spokesman for the Department of Defense said that senior officials were aware of the proposed military budget in West Germany but would have no comment on it at this time.

7 LEADERS END ECONOMIC MEETING; AGREE ON GOAL BUT NOT THE MEANS

Author: HENRY GINIGER, Special to the New York Times

Abstract: Mr. [Reagan] said: ''We leave with a true sense of common understanding and common purpose.'' He expressed gratitude to the others ''for the understanding and support for the economic policies we have embarked upon in the United States.'' 'Pessimists Were Not Justified' It carefully avoided short-range predictions or promises and represented a compromise between countries like France, worried mostly about unemployment, and those like the United States that are aiming mainly at reduc- ing inflation. ''We see low and stable monetary growth as essential to reducing inflation,'' the statement said. ''Interest rates have to play their part in achieving this and are likely to remain high where fears of inflation remain strong.'' During their news conference some of the participants returned to this double theme of military balance with the Soviet Union and arms control. There was no specific reference to Poland in the political statement. Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr. explained this, saying the leaders had felt ''a definite sense of relief'' that the recent congress of the Polish Communist Party was able to proceed without incident. ''It looks like a continuation of the moderating trend,'' he said.

Led by President Reagan, the leaders of Britain, Canada, France, Italy, Japan and West Germany expressed Text of communique, page D18. satisfaction with the outcome of the meeting, and they agreed to meet again next year in France.
The leaders spoke to reporters from the stage of the opera house in the National Arts Center and, for the most part, were careful to emit only sounds of harmony. But some of the basic grievances against the United States, notably over its high interest rates, persisted. After two days of what one official called ''sometimes brutal discussions'' the United States made no concessions on economic policies.
Mr. Reagan said: ''We leave with a true sense of common understanding and common purpose.'' He expressed gratitude to the others ''for the understanding and support for the economic policies we have embarked upon in the United States.'' 'Pessimists Were Not Justified'
Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau, the host, who had predicted a difficult meeting, said that ''the pessimists were not justified.'' He added that the talks had bolstered ''mutual trust and confidence in facing the crises that challenge us.''
The long and carefully balanced final statement smoothed out basic disagreements in promising a twin effort to defeat inflation and unemployment, to avoid economic protectionist policies and to help the poor nations.
It carefully avoided short-range predictions or promises and represented a compromise between countries like France, worried mostly about unemployment, and those like the United States that are aiming mainly at reduc- ing inflation. ''We see low and stable monetary growth as essential to reducing inflation,'' the statement said. ''Interest rates have to play their part in achieving this and are likely to remain high where fears of inflation remain strong.''
Having reflected American monetary policy, the statement went on: ''We are fully aware that levels and movements of interest rates in one country can make stabilization policies more difficult in other countries by influencing their exchange rates and their economies.''
The demands of the French, the West Germans, the Italians and the Canadians were thus met. Absent from the document was any commitment by the United States to bring down interest rates soon, although Mr. Reagan and his officials held out hope that this might happen before the end of the year.
President Francois Mitterrand of France, who pointedly suggested in his closing statements that there was no agreed conclusion on some points, bluntly told the Americans during the talks that any extension of high rates beyond the end of the year would be ''intolerable.'' Balanced Policies
The leaders agreed that a balanced range of policies would be needed to reduce inflation and to achieve higher investment and sustainable growth. The various peoples, their statement said, had to appreciate the need for a change in expectations about growth and earnings, about management and labor practices and relations and change in the direction, scale and pattern of industrial investment. It was agreed, also, that most countries needed ''urgently to reduce public borrowing and increase support for productive investment and innovation.''
But the Europeans, particuarly the French, were vexed about the damping effect of American interest rates on investment at home and the fact that the increase in the value of the dollar had raised their energy import costs and deflected funds from investment.
Mr. Reagan, while expressing his understanding of European difficulties and protesting that high rates were not an American policy but the result of the domestic economic situation, showed little disposition to make immediate changes.
Chancellor Helmut Schmidt of West Germany, one of the sharpest critics along with President Mitterrand, noted at the final news conference that the United States had expressed its intention to do its best to bring down interest rates. But he warned that his country would have to take ''certain decisions,'' which he did not specify.
Secretary of Treasury Donald T. Regan reported an exchange with Gaston Thorn in which the Common Market leader urged him to bring down interest rates, saying: ''Hurry it up, will you? We can't wait too long.'' Accord on Talks
Making no concession on monetary policy, the United States did give some satisfaction to the Canadians, the French and the West Germans on the world's north-south economic disparities, expressing willingness ''to participate in preparations for a mutually acceptable process of global negotiations in circumstances offering the prospect of meaningful progress.''
The Canadians, in particular, greeted this as a major concession by the Reagan Administration after it had expressed little interest in and some puzzlement about global negotiations.
But Richard V. Allen, Mr. Reagan's national security adviser, told reporters that the United States still wanted to know what was involved in such negotiations before making any specific commitment.
The seven leaders, along with Mr. Thorn, head of the Common Market's Commission, held most of their discussions in the seclusion of Chateau Montebello, a lodge 40 miles from Ottawa.
This morning, they flew by helicopter to Ottawa, where they had lunch with the Governor General, Edward R. Schreyer, then held a last meeting in the Parliament complex in the middle of the city. They were guarded by hundreds of policemen, whose main task was to keep back the thousands of ordinary people who sought their first chance to see the leaders in person as their heavily armored cars moved through flag-lined streets. Soviet Trade an Issue
In their final formal statement, and in their meeting with reporters, the leaders placed heavy emphasis on political problems, notably their relations with the Soviet bloc. It was the most marked departure from previous summit meetings. But as Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher explained: ''Political and economic matters cannot be isolated from one another and treated separately.''
As in the case of monetary policy, there was no consensus on how to carry on commercial relations with the Soviet Union. The leaders agreed to consult and coordinate action to insure that ''our economic policies continue to be compatible with our political and security objectives.''
A high-level meeting is to be held this fall to review what the United States would like to be a tightening up of trade so that it does not help to increase the strength of the Soviet bloc. But the French and West Germans made clear their wariness of any policy that might cut their trade relations with Eastern Europe. French Note Wheat Sales
A French spokesman indicated that if the United States sought to reduce the transfer of technology to the Soviet Union, France would raise questions about American grain sales, during a meeting in which the West would ''have to put all its cards on the table.''
There was more agreement on the need for strong defense to offset the buildup of Soviet military power. This goal was laid out last night in a special political statement, which added that the West also sought ''balanced and verifiable arms control and disarmament agreements.''
During their news conference some of the participants returned to this double theme of military balance with the Soviet Union and arms control. There was no specific reference to Poland in the political statement. Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr. explained this, saying the leaders had felt ''a definite sense of relief'' that the recent congress of the Polish Communist Party was able to proceed without incident. ''It looks like a continuation of the moderating trend,'' he said.
President Reagan flew to Washington tonight and one by one the other leaders also took off for their capitals. They left with the same lack of fanfare and ceremony with which they arrived here Sunday for what was considered one of the most informal such conferences ever held, though one of the most intensive.
The meeting was part of a series begun in France in 1975 and since then carried on in each of the member countries.

Full text: The cost of the Army's new M-1 tank has jumped fivefold in the last nine years, to some $2.5 million per vehicle, with inflation the chief reason, Congressional investigators reported today.
''While the M-1 tank is impressive in meeting its three major combat requirements - fire power, mobility and armor protection - these advantages are offset to a considerable degree by shortcomings'' in reliability and maintenance and its rising cost, Walton H. Sheley Jr. of the General Accounting Office told members of the Joint Economic Committee.
The Army plans to buy nearly 7,100 M-1 tanks at a cost of more than $18.5 billion, and had taken delivery of 125 of them from the Chrysler Corporation by the end of June.
Decisions are to be made later this year on whether to increase the maximum production rate from 30 to 60 tanks a month and deploy the M-1 in Western Europe,

Full text: The United States found powerful support for its much-criticized monetary policy today from West Germany's Economics Minister, Count Otto Lambsdorff.
Addressing a ministerial meeting of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, he said that ''it would be entirely wrong not to afford the United States fundamental support for its anti-inflation policy.''
At the same session a top United States official today also defended the policy by insisting that high interest rates, ''however painful domestically and internationally,'' are a result of and not the cause of inflation.
Richard McNamar, Deputy Treasury Secretary, followed a line similar to that taken by Myer Rashish, Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, who, defending the policy yesterday, accused its critics of flagging in the battle against inflation.
Mr. McNamar also said that the Reagan Administration did not envisage a change in policy ''in response to temporary interest rate or exchange rate swings.'' France, Italy Lead Critics
''We have a monetary policy which temporarily is producing high rates,'' he said, not an interest rate policy.
France and Italy led the sharp European criticism of the American policy on the opening day of the meeting yesterday, with France comparing the rates to a ''third oil crisis.''
The reason for the European opposition is that high American interest rates have attracted funds from abroad, thereby depressing foreign currencies. The Europeans have raised their own interest rates defensively, even though it has had a slowing effect on already-depressed economies.
France's Finance Minister, Jacques Delors, today reiterated his attack over the American anti-inflation policies, which, he said, were ''traumatizing'' many countries. But he expressed the hope that the United States course would meet with rapid success.
Mr. Delors told reporters that he had warned O.E.C.D. ministers of the risks of social and political destabilization arising from current United States interest rates, remarking that certain European regions were already affected by de-industrialization, structural unemployment and despair that could be transformed into revolt.
Mr. Delors listed the top financial priorities of the new Socialist Government as defense of the franc, moderate support of the economy, limiting the budget deficit, continuing a strict monetary policy and curbing inflation.

Economic Scene; Why Reagan Is in a Hurry

Abstract: The ghost of the ''guns-and-butter'' economic policy that unleashed inflation in the wake of the Kennedy-Johnson tax cut of 1964 (which the contemporary supply-siders hail as the very model for their own proposed cut) has hung around to haunt the Reagan Administration. The President's aides have sallied forth to quiet those critics who are saying that the Administration's plan to run budget deficits for the next three years will aggravate inflation. In his address to Congress Tuesday night, Mr. [REAGAN] sought to allay anxieties about inflation by presenting his program as a safe cure for the economy's ''sickness.'' While his own health was much improved, the President could not say the same for the economy. Six months since he was elected, he said, inflation was still at a double-digit level, mortgage interest rates hung at 15 percent, eight million workers were still unemployed, the average worker's hourly wage was lower and 6,000 businesses had failed. The current environment of inflation, unemployment and excess capacity, Mr. Reagan suggested, would not be quickly dispelled by his own complex mixture of tax cuts and civilian spending cuts, defense increases, regulatory reforms and monetary restraints. ''Because of the extent of our economy's sickness,'' he said, ''we know that the cure will not come quickly and that, even with our package, progress will come in inches and feet, not in miles.''

Full text: PRESIDENT REAGAN has completed his first 100 days riding the crest of a wave of personal popularity and rising public optimism about the economic outlook. The latest New York Times/ CBS News Poll finds that 67 percent of the respondents approve of Mr. Reagan's handling of his job, a little higher than President Carter rated four years ago.
The rising confidence in Mr. Reagan appears to be translated by a growing number of people into better prospects for their personal fortunes. The poll found that 36 percent of the public now expect to be better off financially a year from now, while 18 percent expect to be worse off. Last December the optimists and pessimists were evenly split, 25 percent to 25 percent.
Paradoxically, Mr. Reagan and his economic advisers are trying to restrain rising optimism about the economy, which has been further buoyed by the leading indicators and the remarkably strong performance of the gross national product in the first quarter.
The Administration is concerned that, as an old Russian proverb has it, ''the bride is too beautiful'' -too beautiful to support the Administration's case for big three-year tax cuts, rapidly rising defense expenditures and projected budget deficits in the presence of inflation. The rise in the prime rate and other interest rates this week dealt a blow to the equity and bond markets, still troubled by worries about chronic inflation.
The ghost of the ''guns-and-butter'' economic policy that unleashed inflation in the wake of the Kennedy-Johnson tax cut of 1964 (which the contemporary supply-siders hail as the very model for their own proposed cut) has hung around to haunt the Reagan Administration. The President's aides have sallied forth to quiet those critics who are saying that the Administration's plan to run budget deficits for the next three years will aggravate inflation.
The President's men heap scorn not so much on the old-fashioned conservatives who have always traced inflation to budget deficits but on the liberals whom they accuse of deserting their former tolerance and sophistication about deficits for the purpose of attacking the President's priorities, social philosophy and defense buildup.
In his address to Congress Tuesday night, Mr. Reagan sought to allay anxieties about inflation by presenting his program as a safe cure for the economy's ''sickness.'' While his own health was much improved, the President could not say the same for the economy. Six months since he was elected, he said, inflation was still at a double-digit level, mortgage interest rates hung at 15 percent, eight million workers were still unemployed, the average worker's hourly wage was lower and 6,000 businesses had failed.
Some other President might have used the recent data suggesting a slowdown in the rate of inflation, revival of production and heightened public optimism as a means of spurring the economic recovery. But that was not Mr. Reagan's concern Tuesday night. Instead, in the presence of a warm and affectionate response from Congressmen on both sides of the aisle, he recited a litany of sad economic statistics as evidence of the economy's persistent sickness, which he had inherited from President Carter, and the urgency of action to cure it.
At the same time, by stressing the economy's suffering from the disease economists call stagflation (which includes a high level of unemployment and idle capacity as well as inflation) Mr. Reagan was implicitly denying that the general economic condition of the United States today is comparable to the overstrained environment that confronted the Johnson Administration during the Vietnam buildup, when the guns-and-butter blunder was committed.
The current environment of inflation, unemployment and excess capacity, Mr. Reagan suggested, would not be quickly dispelled by his own complex mixture of tax cuts and civilian spending cuts, defense increases, regulatory reforms and monetary restraints. ''Because of the extent of our economy's sickness,'' he said, ''we know that the cure will not come quickly and that, even with our package, progress will come in inches and feet, not in miles.''
Then why all the hurry to push the big, complex program through Congress? Because, Mr. Reagan said, ''to fail to act will delay even longer - and more painfully - the cure which must come.''
Whatever the analytical uncertainties about the current economic environment or the impact that the President's program will have upon inflation or stagnation, however, there can be no doubt about the present favorable political environment in the nation and in Congress for passage of Mr. Reagan's economic package.
Mr. Reagan means to seize that tide of public confidence, now that he has it. No politician can ever assume that people will love him in November as they did in May.

TEXT OF STATEMENT ON ECONOMIC MATTERS ADOPTED BY HOUSE DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS

Abstract: The Democratic Party has seen our American government not as an enemy, not as ''the problem,'' as President Reagan said it was in his Inaugural Address, but as a necessary instrument for achieving vital public goals. Government provides for the common defense, for the education of the young, for the exploration of space and assured production of food. No Administration, no matter what its ideology or commitments, can dispense with these and other critical functions of government if it expects to serve the American people. - Tax equity must be sought not only through general tax reduction but in correcting specific inequities, such as the marriage penalty. While controlling Federal spending, cutting taxes in a focused way and reducing the burden of Federal regulations will help, they will not, by themselves, achieve our ultimate goal of reducing inflation and maintaining steady economic growth and high employment. They will not correct inflation's underlying causes. Need for Cooperation Cited Incomes Policy. Our nation needs an incomes policy, a flexible set of methods for combating inflationary wage and price trends. The question of how to design and implement such a policy is highly controversial. That will involve the cooperation of government, labor and business. Built-in wage and price incrases affect today's inflation rate, and ameliorating the costs that they impose on the economy will help the nation gain control of price inflation. Those who suffer most from inflation are wage-earners and their families.

Full text: Following is the text of the statement of Democratic Economic Principles adopted today by the House Democratic Caucus:
For half a century, the Democratic Party has been an engine of equity and progress in America. It has stimulated upward mobility and achieved a better life for millions of Americans. It has been the voice of working men and women, winning for them the right to decent wages and working conditions. It has protected racial and religious minorities from injustice and discrimination. It has promoted quality education for all of America's young and has secured, for older citizens, a living income and adequate medical care. Democratic programs have been the catalyst for vibrant economic growth in the private sector of the economy.
The Democratic Party has seen our American government not as an enemy, not as ''the problem,'' as President Reagan said it was in his Inaugural Address, but as a necessary instrument for achieving vital public goals. Government provides for the common defense, for the education of the young, for the exploration of space and assured production of food. No Administration, no matter what its ideology or commitments, can dispense with these and other critical functions of government if it expects to serve the American people.
Government can become the problem if it fails to respond in a timely and effective fashion to an urgent public need. Controlling rampant inflation is such a need today. It is a profound threat to achieving our goal of sustained economic growth and high employment, to concord between citizens and to our future domestic security. Numerous Causes of Inflation
The causes of high inflation are numerous, most of them experienced by nations throughout the world. Its cures are just as many. There is no single act of government, or of business or labor or of foreign oil-producing states, that can stop inflation in its tracks.
Its momentum, built into certain wage agreements and pricing policies, spurred by rising energy costs, abetted by lagging productivity growth rates, encouraged by expectations of more inflation to come and worsened by high interest rates and high government deficits, is too strong to be reversed by any one policy. It is foolhardy to try to combat inflation with a massive acrossthe-board tax cut whose immediate effect would be to make it much worse.
Inflation can be controlled by the efforts of Congress, the Administration, business and labor. As the majority party in the House of Representatives, Democrats are determined to do their part in bringing the Federal budget into balance. Reducing spending, while it is only one element of anti-inflation policy, is a vital one. Reducing the Federal deficit is important to bringing down interest rates.
A national consensus has developed behind slowing the growth rate of Federal spending, reducing the size of government, including its maze of regulations, and providing tax relief to those whose taxes have grown because inflation has forced them into higher tax brackets.
Democrats will support each of these goals, and will work with the new Administration to achieve them. We will continue the efforts begun by a Democratic Congress to increase competition by eliminating costly and unnecessary government regulation, and to make regulations more cost-effective and simpler where they serve an important natonal purpose, such as insuring health and safety or protecting the environment. Spending Cuts Must Be Equitable
Democrats will not, however, join in any program of fiscal control that puts the main burden of fighting inflation on the backs of the middle-and low-income workers while providing unprecedented benefits for the privileged few. Nor will we support the false economies which will result in more spending and higher deficits in future years. Spending cuts are essential, but they must be cost effective and equitable.
In controlling Federal spending, we intend to abide by the following guidelines:
- We will seek out and eliminate fraud, waste and abuse. We will provide the resources to prosecute those taking advantage of government benefits to which they are not entitled, whether wealthy tax evaders, illegal monopolies or participants in welfare fraud.
- We will promote the work ethic by encouraging recipients of government assistance to work and by resisting cuts that would throw people out of work and onto welfare.
- We will help those who cannot work, particularly the disabled, the sick and the elderly. A society cannot remain healthy and selfrespecting while ignoring those who are poor and helpless through no fault of their own.
- We will strengthen our defense force, in cooperation with our allies, to insure world peace. We will increase military capability and readiness, eliminate Pentagon waste and renew the search for mutual arms control agreements.
- We will promote cooperation rather than conflict among the levels of government. We must recognize local strengths, local initiative and regional differences in the country as we decide the structure and number of Federal programs. We will not purposelessly add unnecessary tax and regulatory burdens to state and local governments.
- We will examine indirect spending through the tax code with the same critical eye we focus on direct spending. Wasteful and unfair tax loopholes will be closed.
- We will upgrade our efforts in the area of law enforcement to intercept the flow of illegal drugs across our borders, stem the tide of illegal immigration, introduce efficiencies into our criminal justice system and work in partnership with state and local governments to combat crime.
In sum, we pledge to develop a lean Federal budget, which puts us on the path to balancing the budget and provides for the human needs of our people. Reagan Tax Cuts Criticized
The Administration has proposed a tax reduction that gives the most substantial relief to the very rich rather than to the middle class, and gives too little attention to the most urgent areas of need, which include the stimulation of investment and savings. In addition, the Administration plan is inflationary because it will stimulate demand before supply, creating enormous deficits in the process.
This program is based on the untested faith that more spendable income will, in time, lead to greater investment and savings without causing an unacceptable rise in inflation in the interim. We believe that this faith is the fiscal equivalent of faith in a free lunch. For these reasons, we firmly reject the Administration's Kemp-Roth plan, as we believe most Americans do.
In reducing taxes, we intend to abide by the following guidelies:
- Tax cuts should be coordinated with spending cuts so as not to increase the deficit.
- Individual tax reductions should be equitably distributed in accordance with the philosophy of a fair, progressive income tax system, with emphasis on helping middle-class Americans overcome the adverse effects of inflation and increased payroll taxes.
- Rather than relying entirely on the untargeted Kemp-Roth plan to increase personal savings, we must offer specific incentives to increase savings of all kinds.
- Tax laws must directly address the specific problems of American business, especially small and medium-sized businesses, through liberalized depreciation and specific incentives for research and technological innovation that will enable us to rejuvenate America's industrial base and make American products more competitive in world markets.
- Tax equity must be sought not only through general tax reduction but in correcting specific inequities, such as the marriage penalty. While controlling Federal spending, cutting taxes in a focused way and reducing the burden of Federal regulations will help, they will not, by themselves, achieve our ultimate goal of reducing inflation and maintaining steady economic growth and high employment. They will not correct inflation's underlying causes. Need for Cooperation Cited
Those underlying causes - our dependence on foreign energy, lagging technology in American industry, the adversarial relationship between business and labor, the escalating wage-price spiral and the failure to develop fully our human capital - must be addressed. We intend to do just that.
As a first step, we need to develop a new attitude of cooperation, among business, labor and government. Neither business nor labor nor government alone can solve the fundamental economic problems of the 1980's. Together we can get the job done.
We must not allow the rhetoric of the moment to create a new myth about government. We have learned that government does not have all the answers. Now we are being told that any government involvement is always a problem, and that the market will always allocate resources fairly and efficiently. That, too, is a myth. Private enterprise has been strengthened, rather than hindered, by government-aided research and development, development of basic transportation facilities and aid to small business, urban areas and farmers.
Virtually every other industrialized nation marshals its scarce economic resources by fostering a continuing dialogue among business, labor and government. It is time we, in America, unite to tackle the most difficult challenges of our future.
As part of building this partnership, we Democrats intend to work to shape a constructive role for government, working in concert with business and labor, in the following areas:
Energy. We must continue to focus on our energy problem. Simply, turning our energy future over to the major energy companies will not solve our energy problem. Rather, we must pursue a balanced policy, emphasizing production and conservation and the development of alternative fuels. And we must develop a modern transportation infrastructure to take full advantage of our energy resources, particularly that of coal. This will help strengthen the country's economy and will make an important contribution toward reducing world dependence on oil. Also, we must continue to develop water resources, especially for adequate and usable supplies of water. In the short term, we must be prepared to deal with the energy emergencies that may result from supply interruptions. Over time, we must work toward ending our dependence on foreign energy.
Technological Innovation. We must reverse the decline in the productivity growth rate. Technological innovation, generated by expenditures for research and development, is the most powerful force for increasing productivity. In recent years American businesses, often with eyes fixed on quarterly balance statements, have not invested in research to bring about the technological advancement necessary to keep our products competitive on world markets. We must increase our investment in research and development. Government must help by funding and encouraging research, just as it has done for decades in agriculture, where America is more productive than any other nation.
Labor-Management Relations. It is time to enter a new era of cooperation between labor and management. Both labor and management must understand that when American industry is not competitive they both suffer, and their suffering can only be reduced if they work together to increase our competitiveness. Government, too, must be involved. It must support managers who take risks to bring about technological change and explore new management techniques like worker democracy. And it must help workers adjust to technological progress so that they will benefit from and welcome technological change.
Incomes Policy. Our nation needs an incomes policy, a flexible set of methods for combating inflationary wage and price trends. The question of how to design and implement such a policy is highly controversial. That will involve the cooperation of government, labor and business. Built-in wage and price incrases affect today's inflation rate, and ameliorating the costs that they impose on the economy will help the nation gain control of price inflation. Those who suffer most from inflation are wage-earners and their families.
Investment in Human Capital. A productive, technologically advanced economy will not run by itself. It needs a healthy, well educated work force. America's greatest wealth is her people, and it is a renewable resource. Through effective education, job training and health and nutrition programs, we must insure that all Americans have the opportunity to become productive members of the work force. Business, labor and government, together, must invest in our precious human capital.
Interest Rates. Falling back on a policy of tight money and high interest rates to contain inflation will be unsuccessful. High interest rates increase the cost of borrowing and promote the wageprice spiral.
Strengthening the Economy. Reducing inflation without abandoning cirizens in need or neglecting those basic underpinnings of economic growth that government alone is capable of financing is not only critical to our domestic well-being, but is essential, too, if America is to continue to play a stabilizing role in the world. Improving our defense forces, in the face of a relentless Soviet buildup of its capabilities, is only one necessary step in assuring the defense of freedom. An American economy with steady, noninflationary growth is also necessary if higher defense expenditures are to be sustained and America's key role in world trade is to continue.
The Democratic Party has faced and surmounted a variety of challenges in the past 50 years. Depression, threats from abroad, inequities in our own country, all have required and received Democratic leadership and Democratic answers. The current challenge to the nation can be met as well. We are dedicated to meeting it in the same confident spirit that our leaders in the past met the tests of their day.

Abstract: In a speech yesterday to the Conference Board, Kenneth W. Dam, provost of the University of Chicago, called for wider recognition that the United States could no longer be envisioned as a ''closed economy'' but had to be seen as an ''open economy'' in the making of all economic policies. He was calling for a fundamental shift of perspective as the basis for revising United States policies in areas ranging from fiscal and monetary policy to antitrust. Antitrust policy, with the avowed purpose of increasing competition domestically, could in fact weaken the competitiveness of United States industry in the world market. Since the 1940's and 1950's, he contended, American antitrust policy has been obsessed with concerns over concentration ratios and barriers to entry. Meanwhile, foreign companies are growing, and taking over shares of the market of even the largest American companies.

Full text: ONE of the hottest issues facing the Reagan Administration is whether to impose import restraints against small, fuel-efficient Japanese cars. The major United States auto producers and the United Automobile Workers union, with the backing of Michigan political leaders, are pressing the Administration for such protection. But the Reagan Cabinet is split on the issue, and the President is still holding his cards close to his vest.
The auto import issue, so important in its own right, is even more crucial as the key to the entire Reagan effort to revitalize the American economy and strengthen its position in the world.
The concern of many economists is that, if the Reagan Administration takes the protectionist route in autos, it will open the door to similar demands by other industries losing ground in the domestic and world market.
In a speech yesterday to the Conference Board, Kenneth W. Dam, provost of the University of Chicago, called for wider recognition that the United States could no longer be envisioned as a ''closed economy'' but had to be seen as an ''open economy'' in the making of all economic policies. He was calling for a fundamental shift of perspective as the basis for revising United States policies in areas ranging from fiscal and monetary policy to antitrust.
Fiscal and monetary actions to stimulate demand, he suggested, had to take account of the international value of the dollar. A depreciating dollar resulting from excessive stimulation would aggravate inflation and set up a vicious cycle.
Antitrust policy, with the avowed purpose of increasing competition domestically, could in fact weaken the competitiveness of United States industry in the world market. Since the 1940's and 1950's, he contended, American antitrust policy has been obsessed with concerns over concentration ratios and barriers to entry. Meanwhile, foreign companies are growing, and taking over shares of the market of even the largest American companies.
The relevant market for many major industries, Mr. Dam said, is the world. General Motors, for example, had 28 percent of the world market for autos in 1978, and Ford had 19 percent, but their shares have been slipping as such companies as Volkswagen, Toyota, Nissan, Renault and Peugeot-Citroen have advanced. Chrysler was fifth in the world auto market in 1959 but had slipped to 15th place in 1978.
In chemicals, Du Pont dropped from first place in 1959 to fourth in 1979, and Union Carbide fell from second to seventh in the world market. In 1959, the United States accounted for seven of the top 10 chemical companies and in 1979 for only three.
Six of the top eight electronics and appliances companies in the world were American in 1959, but only three were in 1979. In steel, the United States accounted for nine of the ten top companies in 1959 but only two in 1979.
The explanations are complex, involving changes in productivity, exchange rates and comparative advantage. The United States, Mr. Dam said, still has a comparative advantage in agriculture, services and such specialized products as wide-bodied aircraft and computers, though he fears, he added, that its advantage is slipping. Antitrust, he maintained, does not recognize the new global environment in which United States companies must compete. Rather, it imposes impediments that make it difficult for them to manage their affairs in a way that reduces costs and increases productivity.
For openers, he would have the antitrust division of the Justice Department throw out its merger guidelines and start afresh with a merger policy based on the assumption that the relevant market is the world. The main effects of such a perspective, he asserted, would lie not in the area of horizontal mergers, which involve direct competitors, but in conglomerate and vertical mergers, where the merged companies are in different stages of production and therefore are not directly competitive. He argues that prohibitions against vertical mergers cannot be defended on economic grounds at all.
If companies cannot merge vertically to compete effectively in the world, he warned, the United States will either have to resort to protectionism in an effort to shore up less competitive American companies or accept a drop in the world market shares of American companies to the point where they will wind up being acquired by more powerful foreign competitors. He opposes import restraints because, he argued, they would only slow down the rationalization of United States companies.
Like Mr. Dam, the liberal traders in Mr. Reagan's camp are afraid that protectionism will ultimately not help but only hurt the effort to strengthen American industry in the world economy.
President Reagan cannot avoid the decision much longer as to whether he is going to be a free-trader or an old-style Republican protectionist. The supply-siders like to stress that President Hoover's major blunder was signing the Smoot-Hawley Tariff of 1929, which helped wreck the world and American economies.
If the Reagan choice is made in favor of protectionism, it will doubtless be billed as temporary and articulated in liberal-trade language. But this may not be enough to avoid exacerbating the danger to United States inflation, declining industrial efficiency and the threat of damage to the world trading mechanism.

PRIMARY FOREIGN AID SURVIVES IN BUDGET

Abstract: An A.I.D. statement on the new budget figures said that in the future, United States contributions to international institutions, such as the World Bank and regional development banks in Latin America, Africa and Asia, ''will depend on how efficiently United States funds are used and how well the institutions serve the interests of the United States and international economic community.'' The reduction from the Carter Administration request in the revised budget and the loss of purchasing power through inflation will require a review of direct aid programs in many developing countries, officials said. These programs in over 90 countries also depend on decisions in Congress on Mr. [Reagan]'s already trimmed foreign aid request.

Full text: The State Department has salvaged the essential parts of the United States foreign economic aid program from proposals by the White House Office of Management and Budget to cut the spending planned by the Carter Administration, but the program still faces an uphill fight in Congress, Government officials said today.
Officials of the United States Agency for International Development said that Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr., with the support of the Treasury Department, had obtained a level of direct economic aid higher than in the last year of the Carter Administration and a White House decision to honor all international commitments to international aid institutions negotiated by the former Administration.
For example, President Reagan's revised budget figures, sent to Congress this week with major cuts in many domestic programs, maintained a $3.2 billion pledge for the International Development Association, which is a World Bank affiliate that lends to the poorest developing countries.
David A. Stockman, the director of the budget and the architect of the Reagan Administration's cuts in spending, had proposed that United States halve its I.D.A. commitment, which was negotiated with other major donor countries as part of a $12 billion replenishment of funds for the agency. Contribution Spread Over 3 Years
The State Department and the Treasury joined forces to oppose this cut, which they regarded as a breach of an international commitment, and the full figure was kept but was spread over three years: $560 million this year, $850 million next year and $1.85 billion the next. American aid officials said the deferral of contributions would not significantly impair the agency's lending ability, although some discussions with other donors would be necessary.
An A.I.D. statement on the new budget figures said that in the future, United States contributions to international institutions, such as the World Bank and regional development banks in Latin America, Africa and Asia, ''will depend on how efficiently United States funds are used and how well the institutions serve the interests of the United States and international economic community.''
The revised budget authorization request for fiscal 1982, which begins Oct. 1, calls for $1.9 billion in direct American aid, which is less than the $2.3 billion requested in the Carter Administration's budget but higher than the $1.7 billion authorized by Congress for the current fiscal year.
The figures for direct assistance do not include economic support funds, which are part of the United States security program. They go mainly to Israel, Egypt, Morocco and other countries where United States military and political interests are involved. The revised figures for these programs have not been announced, but Israel has been told there will be no cuts, officials said.
The reduction from the Carter Administration request in the revised budget and the loss of purchasing power through inflation will require a review of direct aid programs in many developing countries, officials said. These programs in over 90 countries also depend on decisions in Congress on Mr. Reagan's already trimmed foreign aid request.
Budget cutting is now a dominant concern in Congress, and when programs close to home are being reduced, foreign aid is more vulnerable than it is in a time of expanding budgets.

Economic Scene; Reagan's Cuts Stir Skepticism

Abstract: RONALD REAGAN has begun to use the Presidency as what he calls a ''bully pulpit,'' quoting Theodore Roosevelt. But Mr. Reagan faces a congregation full of skeptics and agnostics about his ability to stop inflation, cut Government spending, balance the budget and revitalize the economy. This would be a grave blow to the President and his supply-siders, who have based their program for revitalizing the economy, and eventually balancing the budget and stopping inflation, on the big tax-cut program. However, a majority of economists, including the ''mainstream'' conservatives in Mr. Reagan's camp, are nervous about worsening inflation by putting through Kemp-Roth on schedule and in its original dimensions. Under such an approach, Mr. [Robert V. Roosa] says, actual cash payments into the Treasury would not be reduced for taxpayers above the established minimum. They would instead become forced savers of the equivalent of the 10 percent cut, although he proposes that anyone could sell the notes in the marketplace. That way, there would still be no net cash drain on the Treasury, which would not have to repay or refinance the notes until long after the sequence of 10 percent cuts had been completed. By that time, if all goes well, Mr. Roosa says, ''the economy should have been stimulated to new heights, tax receipts should be booming and the burden of the tax cut would have been shifted forward to a more propitious time.'' The notes could also be made redeemable at a discount, like World War II savings bonds, before their date of maturity.

Full text: RONALD REAGAN has begun to use the Presidency as what he calls a ''bully pulpit,'' quoting Theodore Roosevelt. But Mr. Reagan faces a congregation full of skeptics and agnostics about his ability to stop inflation, cut Government spending, balance the budget and revitalize the economy.
The Economic Forum, a group of 11 leading economists regularly assembled by the Conference Board, a business research group, has just released its forecast that the gross national product will rise by 10.7 percent this year but that nearly the whole rise will result from inflation. Nearly half the members of the forum said they did not expect a balanced Federal budget, even by the fiscal year 1984, a year after Mr. Reagan's present target.
Doubts that the President can cut the budget much this year are widespread. James R. Capra, a senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, warns against the ''misconception'' that Federal spending can be cut or at least slowed soon. In an article in the just published winter edition of Quarterly Review of the New York Fed, he says that if the primary focus of the debate over the control of spending is the current fiscal year, the prospects for meaningful reductions in the fiscal years 1982 or 1983 are likely to be jeopardized, with near-term savings achieved through delays or traded for future program expansions.
Congress and the Administration may have to settle for a longerrange goal of offsetting the revenue losses from a tax cut by 1983, Mr. Capra says. He urges that the process of reconsidering basic legislation begin right away, no matter whether enough changes can be enacted to bring down Federal spending significantly in the current term. Otherwise, he fears, ''the chances for any spending cuts for 1982 may slip away and the opportunities for reducing spending growth in 1983 and beyond could be severely circumscribed.''
But it may be no easy matter for the Reagan Administration to swallow its earlier rhetoric about making prompt and deep cuts in Federal spending to offset proposed tax cuts. The conservative Republicans in Congress, after years of harassing the Democrats over past increases in the debt ceiling, are now threatening to refuse to support President Reagan's proposed $50 billion increase in the debt limit to $985 billion, which was passed by the House yesterday. The thumping of desks in Congress over the debt ceiling looks as much like a charade as ever, because the spending programs and tax bills that produce deficits have long been voted, but it keeps the heat on the Administration to try to shrink the deficit.
Mr. Reagan and his advisers are clearly loath to abandon their drive for enactment of the Kemp-Roth bill, introduced by Representative Jack Kemp of upstate New York and Senator William V. Roth Jr. of Delaware, calling for annual reductions of 10 percent in personal income taxes in the fiscal years 1981, 1982 and 1983, with individual income tax rates thereafter to be indexed to the rate of inflation. Nevertheless, if the Administration seriously intends to link spending cuts to tax cuts, as Mr. Reagan suggests, the tax bill may have to be long delayed and scaled down.
This would be a grave blow to the President and his supply-siders, who have based their program for revitalizing the economy, and eventually balancing the budget and stopping inflation, on the big tax-cut program. However, a majority of economists, including the ''mainstream'' conservatives in Mr. Reagan's camp, are nervous about worsening inflation by putting through Kemp-Roth on schedule and in its original dimensions.
Robert V. Roosa, a senior partner of Brown Brothers Harriman, who served as Under Secretary of the Treasury in the Kennedy Administration, has suggested a way of fulfilling President Reagan's promise of 10 percent tax cuts for each of the next three years without adding to the immediate cash deficit in the budget. He proposes that every taxpayer above a certain minimum income, such as $20,000, be required to receive his or her tax cut in the form of marketable Treasury notes bearing a market rate of interest and maturing in five to eight years.
Under such an approach, Mr. Roosa says, actual cash payments into the Treasury would not be reduced for taxpayers above the established minimum. They would instead become forced savers of the equivalent of the 10 percent cut, although he proposes that anyone could sell the notes in the marketplace. That way, there would still be no net cash drain on the Treasury, which would not have to repay or refinance the notes until long after the sequence of 10 percent cuts had been completed. By that time, if all goes well, Mr. Roosa says, ''the economy should have been stimulated to new heights, tax receipts should be booming and the burden of the tax cut would have been shifted forward to a more propitious time.'' The notes could also be made redeemable at a discount, like World War II savings bonds, before their date of maturity.
The supply-siders might or might not like this idea; it would drastically alter their desire to put more money in individual earners' pockets for saving or spending at the taxpayers' discretion. However, the plan to provide Treasury notes to taxpayers might increase incentives as much as cash payments, increase national savings, defer consumption, raise investment and militate against the inflationary effect of excessive tax cutting.

Abstract: A. Well, again, I have to ask your forbearance and wait until we've finished our study of this whole situation, as to what we're going to do. I don't think any of us have a friendly feeling toward the people that have done what they have done. But, I think it's too complex for me to answer until we've had time to really study this. A. No I'm not concerned that there would be sabotage. I've met with Mr. [Paul Volcker], and not with the intention of trying to dictate; because it is an independent agency and I respect that. But I think that we have to face the fact that interest rates are not in themselves a cause of inflation - they're a consequence. And when you have, as we have had, double-digit inflation back-to-back for two solid years now - the last time that happened was in World War I. And when you have double-digit inflation there that way, there is no question that interest rates are going to have to go up and follow that inflation rate. And so the answer to the interest rates is going to be our program of reducing Government spending, tied to the reduction of the tax rates that we've spoken of, to bring down inflation; and you'll find that interest rates come down. The reason that we've got to tie taxes and we have to cut - tie spending together, is we, for all these decades, we've talked and we've talked about solving these problems and we've acted as if the two were separate. So one year we fight inflation, and then unemployment goes up. And then the next year we fight unemployment, and inflation goes up. It's time to keep the two together where they belong - and that's what we're going to do. Conservative Unhappiness

Full text: Following is a transcript of President Reagan's news conference yesterday in Washington, his first since becoming President, as recorded by The New York Times: OPENING STATEMENT
How do you do, I have a brief opening statement here before I take your questions. Yesterday, Secretary of the Treasury Donald Regan sent to the Congress a request to raise the debt ceiling to $985 billion. This represents a dramatic jump of $50 billion over the previous debt ceiling.
The Administration took this action with great regret because it's clear that the massive deficits our Government runs is one of the root causes of our profound economic problems. And for too many years this process has come too easily for us.
We've lived beyond our means and then financed our extravagance on the backs of the American people. The clear message I received in the election campaign is that we must gain control of this inflationary monster.
Let me briefly review, for the American people, what we've already done: Within moments of taking the oath of office, I placed a freeze on the hiring of civilian employees in the Federal Government. Two days later I issued an order to cut down on Government travel, reduced the number of consultants to the Government, stopped the procurement of certain items, and called on my appointees to exercise restraint in their own offices.
Yesterday, I announced the elimination of remaining Federal controls on U.S. oil production and marketing. Today, I'm announcing two more actions to reduce the size of the Federal Government: First, I'm taking major steps toward the elimination of the Council on Wage and Price Stability. This council has been a failure; it has been totally ineffective in controlling inflation and it's imposed unnecessary burdens on labor and business. Therefore, I am now ending the wage and price program of the council. I am eliminating the staff that carries out its wage-pricing activities and I'm asking Congress to rescind its budget, saving the taxpayer some $1.5 million a year.
My second decision today is a directive ordering key Federal agencies to freeze pending regulations for 60 days. This action gives my Administration time to start a new regulatory oversight process and also prevents certain last-minute regulatory decisions of the previous Administration - the so-called midnight regulations - from taking effect without proper review and approval.
All of us should remember that the Federal Government is not some mysterious institution comprised of buildings, files and paper. The people are the Government. What we create we ought to be able to control.
I do not intend to make wildly skyrocketing deficits and runaway Government simple facts of life in this Administration. As I've said, our ills have come upon us over several decades and they will not go away in days, or weeks, or months.
But I want the American people to know that we have begun. Now, I'll be happy to take your questions. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS Policy Toward Iran
Q. Mr. President, will your policy toward Iran be one of revenge or reconciliation? And will the United States honor the recent commitments to Iran, especially since you approved of most of them during the campaign?
A. Well, I'm not - certainly not thinking of revenge. And I don't know whether reconciliation would be possible with the present Government or absence of a government in Iran. I think that the United States will honor the obligations. As a matter of fact, the most important of those were already put into effect by the preceding Administration in negotiating the release.
We are, however, studying, because there were four major agreements and there were nine executive orders, and we are studying thoroughly what is a pretty complex matter, we've discovered, with regard to whether they are in keeping with international and national - our own national laws.
And so I won't be able to really answer your questions on specifics until we've completed that study. Extent of Budget Cuts
Q. Mr. President, the Treasury Secretary said Monday that your budget cuts will be of a much higher magnitude than people people thought they would be. You said they would be across-the-board. Now that you've had some time to study the budget, can you say where these - where these cuts will be made and what programs will feel the cuts the most?
A. They'll be made every place. What we meant by - maybe acrossthe-board was the wrong decision, although it describes it - what I meant was that no one is exempt from being looked at for areas in which we can make cuts in spending. And, yes, they probably are going to be bigger than anyone has ever attempted; because this Administration did not come here to be a caretaker Government and just hope we could go along the same way, and maybe do it a little better.
We think the time has come where there has to be a change of direction of this country. And it's going to begin with reducing Government spending. Retribution for Terrorists
Q. Mr. President, in your welcoming address to the freed Americans, you sounded a warning of swift and effective retribution in future terrorist situations. What kind of action are you prepared to take to back up this hard rhetoric?
A. Well, that's a question that I don't think you - you can, or should, answer in - as to specifics. This is a big and it's a powerful nation. It has a lot of options open to it. And to try and specify now just particularly what you should do, I think is one of the things that's been wrong.
People have gone to bed in some of these countries that have done these things to us in the past, confident that they can go to sleep waking up in the morning and the United States wouldn't have taken any action. What I meant by that phrase was that anyone who does these things - violates our rights - in the future is not going to be able to go to bed with that confidence. Strategic Arms Treaty
Q. Mr. President, you campaigned rather vociferously against the SALT II treaty, saying it was slanted slightly toward the Soviet Union, and yet I noticed your Secretary of State, Mr. Haig, now seems to suggest that for the time being at least the United States will abide by the limits of the SALT II treaty, and he hopes the Soviet Union will too. How long do you intend that the United States should abide by the terms of a SALT agreement which you consider inequitable? And what do you consider its greatest inequities to be?
A. Well, the SALT treaty first of all, I think permits a continued buildup on both sides of strategic nuclear weapons but for - the main thing authorizes an immediate increase in large numbers of Soviet warheads. There is no verification as to the number of warheads on the missile and no method for us to do this.
I don't think that a treaty - SALT means strategic arms limitation -that actually permits a buildup on both sides of strategic nuclear weapons can properly be called that. And I have said that when we can - and I am willing for our people to go into negotiations, or let me say discussions leading to negotiations, that we should start negotiating on the basis of trying to effect an actual reduction in the numbers of nuclear weapons. That would then be real strategic arms limitation.
And I happen to believe, also, that you can't sit down at a table and just negotiate that unless you take into account - in consideration at that table - all the other things that are going on. In other words, I believe in linkage. Soviet Intentions
Q. Mr. President, what do you see as the long-range intentions of the Soviet Union? Do you think, for instance, the Kremlin is bent on world domination that might lead to a continuation of the cold war? Or do you think that under other circumstances detente is possible?
A. Well, so far detente's been a one-way street the Soviet Union has used to pursue its own aims. I don't have to think of an answer as to what I think their intentions are: They have repeated it.
I know of no leader of the Soviet Union, since the revolution and including the present leadership, that has not more than once repeated in the various Communist Congresses they hold, their determination that their goal must be the promotion of world revolution and a one world Socialist or Communist state - whichever word you want to use.
Now, as long as they do that and as long as they, at the same time, have openly and publicly declared that the only morality they recognize is what will further their cause: meaning they reserve unto themselves the right to commit any crime; to lie; to cheat, in order to obtain that and that is moral, not immoral, and we operate on a different set of standards, I think when you do business with them - even at a detente - you keep that in mind.
Let me take someone - the young lady. Corporate Deals in Iran
Q. Mr. President, What's your opinion of American companies that now want to resume business with Iran? A. My opinion of American companies that want to resume business with Iran? I hope they're going to do it by long distance. We wouldn't want to go back to having just a different cast of characters with the same show going on.
I can understand that, particularly in the field of energy, their wanting to do that. But we are - we're urging that people think, long and hard, before they travel to Iran, because we don't think they're safety can be guaranteed there. U.S. Prisoners in Abroad
Q. Mr. President, three Americans are still incarcerated in Vietnam: Can you tell us of the status of their cases and whether the Administration is doing anything to get them back?
A. I have told our people about those three - they knew about them, of course. But I've told them that yes, we continue. And we want to get them back also.
Now, I know I've been staying down front here too much, I've got to prove I can look at the back rows there, too. Hiring of Minorities
Q. Mr. President, some administrative officials have promised adherence to the civil rights laws which are on the books but there has been considerable discussion about dismantling the affirmative action aspect of - that give those laws to some people greater meaning, and I'm wondering, Mr. President, if there will be a retreat in the Federal Government on the Government's advocacy of affirmative action programs generally, and in Federal hiring of blacks and Hispanics, specifically?
A. No, there will be no retreat. This Administration is going to be dedicated to equality. I think we've made great progress in the civil rights field.
I think there are some things, however, that have - that may not be as useful as they once were, or that may even be distorted in the practice: such as some affirmative action programs becoming quota systems.
And I'm old enough to remember when quotas existed in the United States for the purpose of discrimination. And I don't want to see that happen again. Natural Gas Decontrol
Q. Mr. President, when and how will you seek the decontrol of natural gas prices? A. Well, we haven't dealt with that problem yet: We thought oil would do for a starter. But I can't really answer your question. That will be a matter for discussion in future Cabinet meetings. Grain Restrictions
Q. Mr. President, during the campaign you repeatedly talked about the unfairness of the grain embargo, as you saw it: Do you have second thoughts now or will you lift the grain embargo?
A. Well, with the grain embargo, my quarrel with it from the first was that I thought it was asking only one group of Americans to participate - the farmers.
It was not - you only have two choices with an embargo: You either lift it or you broaden it. And we have not made a decision, except that at the request of Secretary of Agriculture John Block, I have taken the matter of the embargo out of, you might say, the discussions of the National Security Council, and it, next week, is going to -is on the agenda for a full Cabinet meeting as to what our course will be. So, I can't answer what we do about it until next week.
As I say, it was asking one group of Americans to bear the burden and, I have always thought, was more of a kind of gesture than it was a - something real. Atlanta Child Killings
Q. Mr. President, what will you do to honor the request by Federal officials - from Atlanta officials - for you and the Federal Government to intervene in the Atlanta case of 17 missing black children?
A. Just a few minutes before I came in here that message was handed to me - that the Atlanta Mayor wanted to talk. And we are going to get someone in touch with him immediately.
Now, you recognize, of course, that possibly civil rights would be the only basis upon which we could have any jurisdiction down there in this - for F.B.I., for example, on any other thing, there's been no evidence of crossing state lines or anything. And yet we want to be helpful because that is a most tragic case. And so we will be meeting on that very shortly. Latin America Policy
Q. Mr. President, when the Jamaican Prime Minister was here yesterday, Mr. Seaga, he suggested publicly that now be a good time for you, as the new President, to have a foreign policy initiative for Latin America and for the Caribbean. Do you intend to follow that suggestion? And, if so, how would your policies differ from those of former President Carter?
A. Well I think we've seen a great reverse in the Caribbean situation and it came about through Prime Minister Seaga's election. It was the turnover -or turnaround - of a nation that had gone - well, certainly in the direction of the Communist movement; kind of a - it was a protege of Castro - and his election was great - greeted by me with great enthusiasm because it represented a people by their vote having experienced that kind of government turned another direction.
And I think this opens the door for us to have a policy in the Mediterranean of bringing them back in - those countries that might have started in that direction - or keeping them in the Western world and the free world. And so, we are looking forward to cooperation with Prime Minister Seaga.
Q. Mr. President, I think you meant Caribbean in that last answer. A. What did I say? Q. Mediterranean. A. Oh. I meant Caribbean. I'm sorry. Draft Registration
Q. What do you intend to do, Mr. President, about the draft registration law that was passed during President Carter's Administration? And in view of your opposition to it in the campaign, how is that consistent with your avowed intention to strengthen our national defenses?
A. Well, to answer the last part first: I just didn't feel that the advance registration, on all the evidence we could get, would materially speed up the process if an emergency required the draft. It did create a bureaucracy; it caused, certainly, some unrest and dissatisfaction. And we were told that it would only be a matter of several days, if we had to call up in a draft, that we could do that several days earlier with the registration than we would be able to if there was no registration at all.
We - this is one that's - something to be looked at further down - I've only been here nine days and most of these nine days have been spent in Cabinet meetings on the economy, getting ready to send our package up to The Hill. And so I just have to tell you that we will be dealing with that - meet with that, and make a decision on what to do with it down the road someplace. Timing of Tax Cuts
Q. Mr. President, speaking of your economic package, could you give us your thoughts on an effective date for the tax cuts that you plan to recommend in your economic recovery plan and specifying whether you prefer one effective date for business and another for personal cuts, or whether you'd like to combine them?
A. I'd like to see it all go forward all at once. As to date, I know there's been talk of whether it should be retroactive back, or whether it should be as of that minute. That to me isn't as important as getting, for individuals, the principle of a 10 percent cut for each of three years in place, and the business taxes also, so that we can all look forward with some confidence of stability in a program.
And we're going to strive for that and I can't really answer you about what the date will be until we submit the package. Punishment of Iran
Q. Mr. President, I know you said earlier that you were not thinking of revenge toward Iran, but does that preclude any punishment whatsoever for what they've done?
A. Well, again, I have to ask your forbearance and wait until we've finished our study of this whole situation, as to what we're going to do. I don't think any of us have a friendly feeling toward the people that have done what they have done. But, I think it's too complex for me to answer until we've had time to really study this.
Q. One follow-up: Are you - would you go so far as to encourage American businesses to resume commercial trade with Iran? A. At this point, no.
Abolition of e Departments
Q. Mr. President, do you intend to follow through with your campaign pledges to abolish the Departments of Energy and Education?
A. I have not retreated fro that at all. Yes. The process, however, that I have asked for is for both Secretary Bell of Education and Secretary Jim Edwards of Energy to reorganize, to produce the most effective streamlining of the department - of their departments -that they can.
In education, to look at the appropriate role of the Federal Government in education - if there is one. And to report back and then we will decide, making our recommendations.
Much the same thing holds true with the Department of Energy. The reason for this being that while they were new Cabinet-level agencies they incorporated Government functions and programs that had been going on in them when they came under that umbrella.
And we have to find out which of those functions that have been a Federal Government function continue and where they would best fit. But yes, I'm determined that - and I believe - that it was wrong to have created the two agencies to begin with. Dairy Price Supports
Q. Mr. President, during the campaign, your chief farm spokesman put you on record as favoring, for the time being, continuation of the dairy price support level where it had been. Within the last couple of days your Budget Director and your Secretary of Agriculture have indicated that the dairy program is too expensive and should be cut back: Could you reconcile those differences of approach for us?
A. Well, I could only tell you that this, again, is something to wait for the next Cabinet meeting. All of these things are worked about between the appropriate Cabinet members and our Director of Office and - of O.M.B. - and then they come to the Cabinet for full discussion, so that others who have an interest in this can have their input.
And so I can't answer you, because that has not yet come to the Cabinet. Iran-Soviet Stability
Q. Mr. President, Iran and the Soviet Union share a long border in a region vital to the future and stability of the world. Given the anti-U.S. sentiment there, how do you best think the United States can insure the stability of the region?
A. Of the - you said Iran, the border between Iran and the Soviet Union. Well, I think one of the first things that has to happen is - for stability -has got to be in Iran itself to establish a government that can speak as a government for Iran.
And part of our problem in all these long 444 days has been the inability of anyone, seemingly, to speak for that nation; to have a government.
Now, I think that any country would want to help another if they really showed an intent to have a government that would abide by international law and do what they could to help them in that regard.
But until such thing appears apparent there, I don't know that there's anything we can do. Retaliation Against Iran
Q. Mr. President, if it's your intention to signal the world that this country will respond with swift retribution in cases of international terrorism in the future, why is it your policy not to retaliate against Iran?
A. Well, what good would just revenge do and what form would that take? I don't think revenge is worthy of us. On the other hand, I don't think we act as if this never happened and I'd rather wait until, as I say, we complete this thing. Hispanic Appointments
Q. Mr. President, still I got impressed when I listened the other day: Viva la roja, la blanca y azul. Mr. President, isn't it true that when Hispanics are given the opportunity to serve this country they serve the country with experience and with heart? In view of this - on the experience part -when are you going to appoint Hispanic-Americans to serve in your Administration's policy-making positions?
A. We are definitely recruiting and definitely trying to do that. I want an Administration that will be representative of the country as a whole. And please, don't judge us on the fact that we have only picked a hundred: There will be 1,700 positions to fill in the executive branch and the White House senior staff and staff.
And the personnel committee in our Administration that is talent hunting and looking for these people contains members of the minorities - Hispanics - and even a majority of women. And we want that very much so don't judge us now by the tip of the iceberg: Wait till it's all in. Federal Reserve Policy
Q. Mr. President. Yes, thank you. Mr. President, Paul Volcker, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, has been implementing policies that are exactly opposite in basic thrust from what you recommend. He has been squeezing the productive sector of the economy in favor of the speculative sector. Now, I mean, frankly, Mr. President, there are important sections of the American economy that are about to go under and won't even have an opportunity to benefit from the programs you're putting forward because of the Federal Reserve policies.
I have a two-part question: First of all, do you think that objective economic conditions justify the interest-rate levels we now have? And I don't mean for your answer to imply a criticism of the Fed, it's just an objective question.
And the second question is: Are you concerned that there might be a sabotage, so to speak, of your policies by programs that the Federal Reserve might be putting forward?
A. No I'm not concerned that there would be sabotage. I've met with Mr. Volcker, and not with the intention of trying to dictate; because it is an independent agency and I respect that. But I think that we have to face the fact that interest rates are not in themselves a cause of inflation - they're a consequence. And when you have, as we have had, double-digit inflation back-to-back for two solid years now - the last time that happened was in World War I. And when you have double-digit inflation there that way, there is no question that interest rates are going to have to go up and follow that inflation rate. And so the answer to the interest rates is going to be our program of reducing Government spending, tied to the reduction of the tax rates that we've spoken of, to bring down inflation; and you'll find that interest rates come down.
We do want from the Fed, and would ask for, a moderate policy of money supply increasing relative to legitimate growth. All of these things have to work together. But I don't think that the Fed just deliberately raises interest rates.
The reason that we've got to tie taxes and we have to cut - tie spending together, is we, for all these decades, we've talked and we've talked about solving these problems and we've acted as if the two were separate. So one year we fight inflation, and then unemployment goes up. And then the next year we fight unemployment, and inflation goes up. It's time to keep the two together where they belong - and that's what we're going to do. Conservative Unhappiness
Q. Mr. President, a number of conservative leaders - among them some of your staunchest and most durable supporters, such as Senator Jesse Helms, are very concerned about some of your appointments. The basis of the concern is that many people who have been longtime Reaganites and supporters of yours do not seem to be able to get jobs, like Bill Van Cleeve, who played a key role on your defense transition team, whereas other individuals who have not supported you throughout the years, or your philosophy, like Mr. Terrel Bell, the Secretary of Education, who was for the establishment of the department which you said you wanted to abolish, and Mr. Frank Carlucci, destined to be Secretary of Defense, who was not a supporter of yours, that they have gotten jobs.
My question is: why are these individuals in your Administration; why is it, Mr. Van Cleeve, and how much of a problem do you think this conservative dissatisfaction with your appointments is?
A. The only problem that I've had that is more difficult than knowing which hand-raised to point to here -and believe me it bothers me, I go home feeling guilty on all the hands that I couldn't point to - the only problem greater I've had is in the selection of personnel.
Now in many instances, some of the people that have been mentioned, whose names have been mentioned by others, did not want a position in the Administration, helped, worked very hard, and wanted nothing for it. But you also have to recognize, there aren't that many positions. After all, look how many votes I had. You can't reward them all.
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. A. Thank you. All right. Thank you all, very much.

FINAL ECONOMIC REPORT ASKS FISCAL RESTRAINTS TO BATTLE INFLATION

Abstract: At a news briefing, Mr [Charles L. Schultze] argued that ''personal tax cuts are not likely to have a large supply-side effect,'' meaning that they would not stimulate production without stimulating inflation. ''The nation cannot avoid the need for budgetary restraint,'' he said. Similarly, Mr. Schultze said he had no quarrel with the Federal Reserve, which has pushed interest rates to record heights in efforts to control inflation by slowing the economy. Inflation Worst Problem ''While the magnitude of these challenges is cause for serious concern, it does not warrant pessimism,'' the report maintains. Mr. Schultze more explicitly rejected the call to declare an ''economic emergency,'' as suggested by some of Mr. [Ronald Reagan]'s advisers. Working down inflation, the report maintans, requires that ''uncertainty must be resolved in favor of caution'' because ''an increase in inflation once under way is so very hard to eliminate.''

Full text: In its final Economic Report to Congress, the Carter Administration said today that the only way to reduce inflation was to continue restraint in tax reduction, Government spending and the growth of the money supply.
The advice from the departing Council of Economic Advisers represented a veiled warning against policy proposals Excerpts from council report, page 26. that promise fast results, which some of President-elect Ronald Reagan's advisers have said they would achieve.
''There will be a continuing need for careful and prudent fiscal policies to restrain demand'' for goods and services, the report said.
More specifically, the report rejected heavy tax cuts for individuals. Mr. Reagan, who has endorsed such cuts, has argued that they would unleash productive forces and spur investment.
Mr. Carter's advisers advocate limited tax cuts principally for business and a policy that would provide tax rewards to employees who restrain demands for large wage settlements. Turnabout in Thinking
The report, an unusually careful analysis for an outgoing Administration, reflected the marked turnabout in economic philosophy of the Carter team and particularly Charles L. Schultze, the council chairman.
Arriving as liberals, the Carter team immediately increased Government spending and cut taxes. Three years later, after inflation accelerated sharply, the Carter advisers fought for cuts in spending and against tax reduction.
At a news briefing, Mr Schultze argued that ''personal tax cuts are not likely to have a large supply-side effect,'' meaning that they would not stimulate production without stimulating inflation. ''The nation cannot avoid the need for budgetary restraint,'' he said. Similarly, Mr. Schultze said he had no quarrel with the Federal Reserve, which has pushed interest rates to record heights in efforts to control inflation by slowing the economy. Inflation Worst Problem
The report was unequivocal in arguing that the most serious problem to be faced was inflation. Unlike last year's report, which began with a review of the year's economic events, the 1981 report opens with a discussion of ''Inflation and Growth in the 1980's.''
''Inflation has taken a very real toll,'' the report argued. ''The uncertainty it has brought with it cannot be measured, but the consequent anxiety has torn at the fabric of our society.''
For 1981, the report's forecast is stark. Inflation, it predicted, is likely to accelerate slightly from last year's 10 percent level, as measured by an index known as the gross national product deflator. This is a more broadly based measure than the Consumer Price Index, which tends to shower higher rates of inflation. And economic growth is expected to virtually evaporate in the first half of 1981 and then resume at a 3.5 percent pace, which is respectable in comparison with recent performance. The views are consistent with the bulk of private economic forecasters.
At the same time, the advisers are not completely pessimistic, noting past economic successes and contending that the country has begun to tackle tough problems, such as energy.
''While the magnitude of these challenges is cause for serious concern, it does not warrant pessimism,'' the report maintains. Mr. Schultze more explicitly rejected the call to declare an ''economic emergency,'' as suggested by some of Mr. Reagan's advisers.
Both the council chairman and the report maintained that Mr. Reagan could benefit from a reversal in trends that penalized the Democrats. For example, growth in the labor force in the 1980's is expected to drop by half, meaning more experienced workers, more productivity and less unemployment, the report argued.
Among the specific points in the report were these:
- ''A flexible response on the part of monetary policy'' is needed, paricularly because of the possibility that under some circumstances, tight restraint on the growth of money could unduly constrict the economy. In addition, the focus on short-run performance of the money supply should be reduced and ''better understanding of the complexities should be achieved.''
- Productivity, which has lagged in recent years, ''could well record a slight decline'' in the first half of 1981. But then output per worker is forecast to begin rising by 1.5 percent a year or more. Large increases in productivity reduce inflationary pressures and encourage economic growth.
- Wage increases are expected to accelerate again in 1981. Compensation per hour is forecast to go up by 10.5 to 11 percent, as against 10.2 percent in 1980.
- The 1979-80 explosion in oil prices turned out to be even larger than the 1973-74 rise, when the size of the increase in dollars is compared with the gross national product. Previously, most assessments had focused on the larger percentage increase in oil prices in 1973-74.
- Agricultural subsidies should be curtailed. In part, they have come to be subsidies for exports, and in part, they represent an unnecessary burden on taxpayers, the report contends. Carter Defends Record
The document issued today is formally titled the ''Economic Report of the President.'' But Mr. Carter's message covers only the first 19 pages and is actually written by his Council of Economic Advisers. The council's own Annual Report covers 190 pages.
In his section, Mr. Carter acknowledges economic problems but also contends that neither his own economic record nor the performance of the economy were as bad as popularly thought. In the first category, he recalls his deregulation of industries such as airlines. In the second, he cites record increases in jobs and improvement in foreign trade.
Mr. Carter's legislative proposals, already announced as part of the budget and now largely irrelevant, include deferring tax cuts for individuals and imposing a 10-cent gasoline fee. In addition, Mr. Carter seeks to delay national health insurance.
Mr. Carter, arguing for restraint, said, ''Twice in the last decade the tendency for Government to stimulate the economy somewhat too freely during the recovery from recession probably played a role in retarding the decline of inflation or renewing its acceleration.''
The first chapter of the council's report is a reasoned analysis of the causes of inflation and the prospective solutions. At the outset, the report observes that ''rising prices are often treated as something that directly lower real incomes, even when in fact for the nation as a whole they do not.'' What does lower real incomes, the report says, are changes such as higher prices for imported oil and declines in productivity, both of which occurred in 1979.
Once created, inflation does not recede today the way it has in the past, the report maintained. The underlying or basic rate of inflation has risen from 1 percent in the early 1960's to about 4 percent in the late 1960's and then to 7 percent in the mid-70's and nearly 10 percent today. Impact of Budget Deficits
Although some economists blame budget deficits, the report argues that while controlling deficits can help control inflation, deficits have not been the principal cause of inflation.
In essence, the report contends that the problem is that wages and prices have failed to move downward, after having been driven up by outside shocks or excessive stimulation of the economy. Cost-ofliving clauses for workers and the rise of large, multiyear union contracts are cited as causes.
But the most emphasis is put on the change in governmental philosophy, which has led to the belief that when the economy weakens, ''expansionary Government policies will be applied sooner or later.'' That, the report contends, ''removes much of the motivation for moderating wage and price behavior.''
Maintaining slow growth or recession could reduce inflationary pressures, the report said. The cost could be $100 billion in lost output and a half percentage point more of unemployment for three years to reduce inflation by 1 percentage point.
Working down inflation, the report maintans, requires that ''uncertainty must be resolved in favor of caution'' because ''an increase in inflation once under way is so very hard to eliminate.''
Mr. Schultze stressed that monetary and fiscal restraint was ''the first and most important way to reduce inflation.'' Lowering Expectations
In addition, inflation can be reduced by lowering expectations, but the report added: ''The mere announcement of Government intentions is unlikely to produce a significant change in wage and price behavior.''
In his briefing, Mr. Schultze cited uncertainties that could make the economy better or worse than his forecast. He saw as possibilities for a better economy a shift upward in productivity growth, a faster deceleration in wage increases, or a faster increase in business investment. On the downside, he mentioned another runup in oil prices or a ''collision'' between Federal Reserve policies and the economy.

Abstract: U.S.-Soviet relations remain strained by the continued Soviet presence in Afghanistan, by growing Soviet military capabilities and by the Soviets' apparent willingness to use those capabilities without respect for the most basic norms of international behavior. Now, as was the case a year ago, the prospect of Soviet use of force threatens the international order. The Soviet Union has completed preparations for a possible military intervention against Poland. Although the situation in Poland has shown signs of stabilizing recently, Soviet forces remain in a high state of readiness and they could move into Poland on short notice. We continue to believe that the Polish people should be allowed to work out their internal problems themselves, without outside interference, and we have made clear to the Soviet leadership that any intervention in Poland would have severe and prolonged consequences for East-West detente, and U.S.-Soviet relations in particular. Defense Budget The United States has continued to play its traditional role of safe haven for those who flee or are forced to flee their homes because of persecution or war. During 1980, the United States provided resettlement opportunities for 216,000 refugees from countries arund the globe. In addition, the United States joined with other nations to provide relief to refugees in country of first asylum in Africa, the Middle East and Asia.

Full text: Following are excerpts from President Carter's written State of the Union Message to Congress, issued by the White House today:
The State of the Union is sound. Our economy is recovering from a recession. A national energy plan is in place and our dependence on foreign oil is decreasing. We have been at peace for four uninterrupted years.
But, our nation has serious problems. Inflation and unemployment are unacceptably high. The world oil market is trouble spots throughout the world, and 53 American hostages are being held in Iran against international law and against every precept of human affairs.
However, I firmly believe that, as a result of the progress made in so many domestic and international areas over the past four years, our nation is stronger, wealthier, more compassionate and freer than it was four years ago. I am proud of that fact. And I believe the Congress should be proud as well, for so much of what has been accomplished over the past four years has been due to the hard work, insights and cooperation of Congress. I applaud the Congress for its efforts and its achievements.
In this State of the Union Message I want to recount the achievements and progress of the last four years and to offer recommendations to the Congress for this year. While my term as President will end before the 97th Congress begins its work in earnest, I hope that my recommendations will serve as a guide for the direction this country should take so we build on the record of the past four years.
- Almost all of our comprehensive energy programs have been enacted, and the Department of Energy has been established to administer the program.
- Confidence in the Government's integrity has been restored, and respect for the Government's openness and fairness has been renewed.
- The Government has been made more effective and efficient: The Civil Service system was completely reformed for the first time this century; 14 reorganization initiatives have been proposed to the Congress, approved and implemented; two new Cabinet departments have been created to consolidate and streamline the Government's handling of energy and education problems; inspectors general have been placed in each Cabinet department to combat fraud, waste and other abuses; the regulatory process has been reformed through creation of the Regulatory Council, elimination of unnecessary regulation and passage of the Regulatory Flexibility Act; procedures have been established to assure citizen participation in Government, and the airline, trucking, rail and communications industries are being deregulated.
- Critical social problems, many long ignored by the Federal Government, have been addressed directly. An urban policy was developed and implemented to reverse the decline in our urban areas; the Social Security System was refinanced to put it on a sound financial basis; the Humphrey-Hawkins Full Employment Act was enacted; Federal assistance for education was expanded by more than 75 percent; the minimum wage was increased to levels needed to ease the effects of inflation; affirmative action has been pursued aggressively - more blacks, Hispanics and women have been appointed to senior Government positions and to judgeships than at any other time in our history; the E.R.A. (equal rights amendment) ratification deadline was extended to aid the ratification effort, and minority business procurement by the Federal Government has more than doubled.
- The nation's first sectoral policies were put in place, for the auto and steel industries, with my Administration demonstrating the value of cooperation between the Government, business and labor.
- Reversing previous trends, real defense spending has increased every year since 1977; the real increase in fiscal year 1980 defense spending is well above 3 percent and I expect fiscal year 1981 defense spending to be even higher.
- The NATO Alliance has proven its unity in responding to the situations in Eastern Europe and Southwest Asia and in agreeing on the issues to be addressed in the review of the Helsinki Final Act currently underway in Madrid.
- The peace process in the Middle East established at Camp David and by the peace treaty between Egypt and Israel is being buttressed on two fronts: steady progress in the normalization of EgyptianIsraeli relations in many fields, and the commitment of both Egypt and Israel, with United States' assistance, to see through to successful conclusion the autonomy negotiations for the West Bank and Gaza.
- The Panama Canal treaties have been put into effect, which has helped to improve relations with Latin America.
- We have continued this nation's strong commitment to the pursuit of human rights throughout the world, evenhandedly and objectively; our commitment to a worldwide human rights policy has remained firm, and many other countries have given high priority to it.
- Our resolve to oppose aggression, such as the illegal invasion of the Soviet Union into Afghanistan, has been supported by tough action. Ensuring Economic Strength
During the last decade our nation has withstood a series of economic shocks unprecedented in peacetime. The economy has proved to be remarkably resilient. Real output has grown at an average rate of 3 percent per year since I took office, and employment has grown by 10 percent. We have added about 8 million productive private sector jobs to the economy. However, unacceptably high inflation - the most difficult economic problem I have faced - persists. Calls for Budget Restraint
This inflation, which threatens the growth, productivity and stability of our economy, requires that we restrain the growth of the budget to the maximum extent consistent with national security and human compassion. I have done so in my earlier budgets, and in my fiscal year 1982 budget. However, while restraint is essential to any appropriate economic policy, high inflation cannot be attributed solely to government spending. The growth in budget outlays has been more the result of economic factors than the cause of them.
We are now in the early stages of economic recovery following a short recession. Typically, a post-recessionary period has been marked by vigorous economic growth aided by antirecessionary policy measures such as large tax cuts or big, stimulation spending programs. I have declined to recommend such actions to stimulate economic activity, because the persistent inflationary pressures that beset our economy today dictate a restrained fiscal policy.
Accordingly, I am asking the Congress to postpone until January 1, 1982, the personal tax reductions I had earlier proposed to take effect on January 1 of this year.
However, my 1982 budget proposes significant tax changes to increase the sources of financing for business investment. While emphasizing the need for continued fiscal restraint, this budget takes the first major step in a long-term tax reduction program designed to increase capital formation.
The failure of our nation's capital stock to grow at a rate that keeps pace with its labor force has clearly been one cause of our productivity slowdown. Higher investment rates are also critically needed to meet our nation's energy needs, and to replace energyinefficient plants and equipment with new energy-saving physical plants. The level of investment that is called for will not occur in the absence of policies to encourage it.
Therefore, my budget proposes a major liberalization of tax allowances for depreciation, as well as simplified depreciation accounting, increasing the allowable rates by about 40 percent. The 1982 Budget
The fiscal year 1982 budget I have sent to the Congress continues our four-year policy of prudence and restraint. In 1976, before I took office, the budget deficit equaled 4 percent of gross national product. It had been cut to 2.3 percent in the 1980 fiscal year just ended. My 1982 budget contains a deficit estimated to be less than 1 percent of our gross national product.
The rate of growth in Federal spending has been held to a minimum. Nevertheless, outlays are still rising more rapidly than many had anticipated, the result of many powerful forces in our society: Sees Threat to Security
We face a threat to our security, as events in Afghanistan, the Middle East and Eastern Europe make clear. We have a steadily aging population and, as a result, the biggest single increase in the Federal budget is the rising cost of retirement programs, particularly Social Security. We face other important domestic needs: to continue responsibility for the disadvantaged; to provide the capital needed by our cities and our transportation systems; to protect our environment; to revitalize American industry, and to increase the export of American goods and services so essential to the creation of jobs and a trade surplus.
Yet the Federal Government itself may not always be the proper source of such assistance. For example, it must not usurp functions if they can be more appropriately decided upon, managed and financed by the private sector or by state and local governments. My Administration has always sought to consider the proper focus of responsibility for the most efficient resolution of problems.
PICKUP ADD Enhancing National Security - American Military Strength
The maintenance of national security is my first concern, as it has been for every President before me. We must have both the military power and the political will to deter our adversaries and to support our friends and allies. The U.S.-Soviet Relationship
We are demonstrating to the Soviet Union across a broad front that it will pay a heavy price for its aggression in terms of our relationship. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the imposition of a puppet government have highlighted in the starkest terms the darker side of their policies - going well beyond competition and the legitimate pursuit of national interest, and violating all norms of international law and practice. Bilateral Communication
U.S.-Soviet relations remain strained by the continued Soviet presence in Afghanistan, by growing Soviet military capabilities and by the Soviets' apparent willingness to use those capabilities without respect for the most basic norms of international behavior.
But the U.S.-Soviet relationship remains the single most important element in determining whether there will be war or peace. Poland
Now, as was the case a year ago, the prospect of Soviet use of force threatens the international order. The Soviet Union has completed preparations for a possible military intervention against Poland. Although the situation in Poland has shown signs of stabilizing recently, Soviet forces remain in a high state of readiness and they could move into Poland on short notice. We continue to believe that the Polish people should be allowed to work out their internal problems themselves, without outside interference, and we have made clear to the Soviet leadership that any intervention in Poland would have severe and prolonged consequences for East-West detente, and U.S.-Soviet relations in particular. Defense Budget
The Soviet Union has built a war machine far beyond any reasonable requirements for their own defense and security. In contrast, our own defense spending declined in real terms every year from 1968 through 1976.
We have reversed this decline in our own effort. Every year since 1976 there has been a real increase in our defense spending, and our lead has encouraged increases by our allies. With the support of the Congress, we must and will make an even greater effort in the years ahead.
The fiscal year 1982 budget would increase funding authority for defense to more than $196 billion. This amount, together with a supplemental request for fiscal year 1981 of about $6 billion, will more than meet my Administration's pledge for a sustained growth of 3 percent in real expenditures and provides for 5 percent in program growth in fiscal year 1982 and beyond.
The trends we mean to correct cannot be remedied overnight; we must be willing to see this program through. To ensure that we do so I am setting a growth rate for defense that we can sustain over the long haul. The Human Dimension of Foreign Policy Human Rights
1980 has been a year of some disappointments, but has also seen some positive developments in the ongoing struggle for fulfillment of human rights throughout the world. In the year we have seen:
- Free elections were held and democratic governments installed in Peru, Dominica and Jamaica. Honduras held a free election for installation of a constituent assembly. An interim government was subsequently named pointing toward national presidential elections in 1981. Brazil continues on its course of political liberalization.
- The ''Charter of Conduct'' signed in Riobamba, Ecuador, by Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, Peru, Costa Rica, Panama and Spain affirms the importance of democracy and human rights for the Andean countries.
- The Organization of American States, in its annual General Assembly, approved a resolution in support of the Inter-American Human Rights Commission's work. The resolution took note of the Commission's annual report, which described the status of human rights in Chile, El Salvador, Paraguay and Uruguay, and the special reports on Argentina and Haiti, which described human rights conditions as investigated during on-site inspections to these countries.
The United States, of course, cannot take credit for all these various developments. But we can take satisfaction in knowing that our policies encourage and perhaps influence them.
Those who see a contradiction between our security and our humanitarian interests forget that the basis for a secure and stable society is the bond of trust between a government and its people. Humanitarian Aid
The United States has continued to play its traditional role of safe haven for those who flee or are forced to flee their homes because of persecution or war. During 1980, the United States provided resettlement opportunities for 216,000 refugees from countries arund the globe. In addition, the United States joined with other nations to provide relief to refugees in country of first asylum in Africa, the Middle East and Asia.
The great majority of refugee admissions continued to be from Indochina. During 1980, 168,000 Indochinese were resettled in the United States. Although refugee populations persist in camps in Southeast Asia, and refugees continue to flee Vietnam, Laos and Kampuchea, the flow is not as great as in the past.
In addition to the refugees admitted last year, the United States accepted for entry into the United States 125,000 Cubans who were expelled by Fidel Castro. Federal and state authorities, as well as private voluntary agencies, responded with unprecedented vigor to coping with the unexpected influx of Cubans.
Major relief efforts to aid refugees in countries of first asylum continued in several areas of the world. In December 1980, 32 nations, meeting in New York City, agreed to contribute $65 million to the continuing famine relief program in Kampuchea.
It cannot be ignored that the destructive and aggressive policies of the Soviet Union have added immeasurably to the suffering in these three tragic situations. The Control of Nuclear Weapons
We have been proceeding on a number of fronts:
- First, we have been seeking to encourage nations to accede to the Non-Proliferation Treaty. The U.S. is also actively encouraging other nations to accept full-scope safeguards on all of their nuclear activities and is asking other nuclear suppliers to adopt a fullscope safeguards requirement as a condition for future supply.
- Second, the International Nuclear Fuel Cycle Evaluation (I.N.F.C.E.), which was completed in 1980, demonstrated that suppliers and recipients can work together on these technically complex and sensitive issues. While differences remain, the I.N.F.C.E. effort provides a broader international basis for national decisions which must balance energy needs with nonproliferation concerns.
- Finally, we are working to encourage regional cooperation and restraint. Protocol I of the Treaty of Tlatelolco, which will contribute to the lessening of nuclear dangers for our Latin American neighbors, ought now to be ratified by the United States Senate. Limitations on Strategic Arms
I remain convinced that the SALT II Treaty is in our nation's security interest and that it would add significantly to the control of nuclear weapons. I strongly support continuation of the SALT process and the negotiation of more far-reaching mutual restraints on nuclear weaponry. Conclusion
We have new support in the world for our purposes of national independence and individual human dignity. We have a new will at home to do what is required to keep us the strongest nation on earth.
We must move together into this decade with the strength which comes from realization of the dangers before us and from the confidence that together we can overcome them.

THE MIXED BLESSINGS OF MEXICO'S OIL

Abstract: Meanwhile, Antonio Juarez Soriano, a 29-year-old security guard, stood on the balcony of Perisur's elegant internal mall and watched the crowds below struggling with large packages in arms and children in tow. ''People are spending in a minute what I earn in a month,'' he said, with no apparent bitterness in his voice. ''But they're people with education. I only did two years at school.'' His own wage of $300 a month is being rapidly eroded by inflation - the rate hit 30 percent last year. ''We hear a lot about the oil on television,'' he said, ''but I can't afford new clothes or shoes for the family. You know, six of us live in one room. I must look for a better-paid job.'' President [Jose Lopez Portillo], two-thirds of the way through his sixyear term, is sensitive to the paradox. ''It is universally recognized that the country's future is assured,'' he noted recently, ''yet it is here, within our country, that we are full of doubts about our future.'' The ''great opportunity'' offered by oil, he said grimly, is being threatened by ''destructive confrontation, disorder, inefficiency, lack of understanding, egotism and corruption.'' The dominating challenge for the next administration, though, will be the effects and opportunities of Mexico's oil bounty. ''The differences between the rich and poor are becoming more acute,'' Heberto Castillo, leader of the small Mexican Workers Party, wrote recently. ''The people know that the rich include Government officials. No one believes that a senior Government official can be poor, while 70 percent of Mexicans, some 50 million people, live in conditions that become more precarious by the day.'' One Mexican analyst noted cynically that Mexicans do not suffer from unfulfilled expectations ''because they never expected to see any of the oil wealth.'' But surely they never expected oil to make them poorer. On the international stage, oil has given Mexico the confidence to raise its voice. This year, the country took a seat on the United Nations Security Council for the first time since 1946, while next June it expects to play host to an unprecedented ''North-South'' summit to be attended by the leaders of some 25 industrialized and developing nations. Just last month, Mexico unilaterally renounced all remaining fishing agreements with the United States, arguing, in the words of one official, that ''there is no reason to allow the United States to fish in our waters if there is no reciprocity.'' The reciprocity he apparently had in mind was the allocation to Mexico of a quota for catching squid off the New England coast. Washington has refused to grant the quota.

Full text: Alan Riding is The New York Times's Mexico City bureau chief. By Alan Riding
On the southern edge of Mexico City -where the capital's grimy air is purified by nearby pine forests and, on most days, the distant, snow-capped Popocatepetl volcano is actually visible - a stunning glass and cement creation opened last October. Hundreds of thousands of Mexicans have since flocked to see it, to explore its passages, to gawk at its exhibits, even to contribute generously to its upkeep. For the Perisur, as it is called, is that most appropriate monument to the changes that sudden oil wealth has brought to Mexico: a shopping center.
Covering 52 acres, with four department stores, 154 shops, plus restaurants and banks and a parking area that is already too small, Perisur is, in fact, the largest shopping center in Latin America. Its counters are stocked with expensive imported products - from Japanese motorcycles to Polish glassware - that until recently few Mexicans could afford. ''It's amazing,'' said one shopper, the wife of a senior Government official, a few days after the grand opening. ''Soon people won't have to go to Houston for their shopping.''
Meanwhile, Antonio Juarez Soriano, a 29-year-old security guard, stood on the balcony of Perisur's elegant internal mall and watched the crowds below struggling with large packages in arms and children in tow. ''People are spending in a minute what I earn in a month,'' he said, with no apparent bitterness in his voice. ''But they're people with education. I only did two years at school.'' His own wage of $300 a month is being rapidly eroded by inflation - the rate hit 30 percent last year. ''We hear a lot about the oil on television,'' he said, ''but I can't afford new clothes or shoes for the family. You know, six of us live in one room. I must look for a better-paid job.''
Mexico has always been a nation of contrasts and contradictions, but never more than today. Within five years, the country's oil income has rocketed from $3 billion to $14 billion. Those oil dollars are being poured into industrial expansion, and the economy is growing an unprecedented 8 percent annually. Yet the nature of the boom, against a background of explosive population growth, is creating worrisome social and political tensions at home, while Mexico's new oil wealth has inspired a dramatic change in the nation's posture toward the world in general and the United States in particular.
Once an introspective and reluctant satellite of its neighbor to the north, Mexico has been transformed by oil into a burgeoning regional power, anxious to raise its voice on international affairs, quick to cross swords with Washington. The change was evident last month when Mexico unilaterally terminated fishing agreements with the United States. It was recognized by Ronald Reagan with his decision to hold preinauguration talks with President Jose Lopez Portillo. Indeed, Mexico's businessmen and officials are courted today wherever they go, and the nation's economic growth is the envy of a world struggling with recession.
Yet the self-confident Mexico seen strutting across the hemispheric stage contrasts sharply with the country's somber mood at home. Fortunes are being made, but hardship is spreading. Even business executives and senior Government officials - reveling in the fruits of record company profits, exorbitant salaries and endemic corruption - are beginning to get nervous. Having just joined the exclusive and influential club of major oil exporters, Mexico is already displaying some of the ill effects of sudden wealth and chaotic growth.
On Sept. 16, Independence Day, Miguel Jesus Solis traveled from nearby Toluca to the capital's main plaza to sell Mexican flags. ''What has happened to all the oil?'' the 29-year-old street vendor asked as he watched soldiers parade by in new uniforms. ''All I know is that prices go up and up. A liter of Coca-Cola costs six times as much as a liter of gasoline. At this rate, we'll finish up drinking gasoline.''
President Lopez Portillo, two-thirds of the way through his sixyear term, is sensitive to the paradox. ''It is universally recognized that the country's future is assured,'' he noted recently, ''yet it is here, within our country, that we are full of doubts about our future.'' The ''great opportunity'' offered by oil, he said grimly, is being threatened by ''destructive confrontation, disorder, inefficiency, lack of understanding, egotism and corruption.''
So far, the widespread social malaise has found no political expression beyond cynical resignation. But an influential politician has warned: ''We're living in one of the most dangerous periods of our history. We're growing wildly, but we don't seem to know where we are going.'' When Lopez Portillo took office in December 1976, he inherited the worst economic crisis in four decades. The peso was sinking fast, inflation was out of control, unemployment was rising, investment was at a standstill and the private sector was deeply disenchanted with the antibusiness rhetoric and populist reforms of his predecessor, President Luis Echeverria Alvarez. The only card Lopez Portillo had was oil, yet even that stirred little public confidence. There was widespread skepticism that Mexico indeed had such large stores of oil as Lopez Portillo believed, and the oil card would have to be played by Pemex, a state-owned monopoly with a widespread reputation for inefficiency and corruption. Lopez Portillo nevertheless held down wages, credit, imports and Government spending while pouring all available resources into the company. And Pemex did the job.
Specifically, Jorge Diaz Serrano did the job. It was in December 1976 that Diaz Serrano, an urbane 59-year-old engineer who had made a fortune as an oil contractor, took his first post in Government - as director general of Pemex. Unlike the company's previous management, he fervently believed that Mexico possessed vast oil reserves. And, within three weeks of taking office, he was able to announce an increase in Mexico's proven hydrocarbon reserves - Mexico combines crude oil and natural gas in its estimates - from 6.3 billion to 11.1 billion barrels. He also announced a $15 billion investment program intended almost to triple Mexico's production by 1982, to 2.24 million barrels a day.
Today, those figures look laughably conservative. Production has already reached the 2.4 million barrel mark; oil exports during 1980 earned Pemex about $10 billion. Proven reserves, some two-thirds of which are oil, now stand at 60.1 billion barrels, with total ''potential'' reserves of 250 billion barrels. If confirmed, these would place Mexico in the same category as Saudi Arabia.
When the dimension of Mexico's oil bonanza was recognized, officials began looking around the oil-exporting world for a model to guide their country's own development. But they saw only what they wanted to avoid. Venezuela, for example, woke up in the 1970's to find it had spent 50 years of oil earnings on imported food and luxury items and had built up all too little industry. Saudi Arabia spent huge sums on sophisticated armaments and foreign technology but was never able to become independent of the major multinational oil companies and Western technicians. And, most worrisome, Iran tried to modernize its socioeconomic structure so quickly that its rigid political system fell victim to cultural and religious rebellion.
Yet Lopez Portillo and his aides found cause for optimism in the fact that Mexico was different. It had already undergone a major social revolution,between 1910 and 1917, that had broken the entrenched power of the Roman Catholic Church and the rural aristocracy, and had installed a broad-based political system committed to improving the lot of the poor. As early as 1938, it had nationalized its oil industry and therefore had no need to invite in the oil majors. Further, its economy had grown rapidly since World War II, creating a firm industrial base on which an oil-financed expansion could build, guided by thousands of skilled bankers, entrepreneurs, economists and engineers.
All of which helps explain why the administration has been taken aback by how quickly the economy has fallen victim to the ills of sudden oil wealth - ''la petrolizacion,'' as the Mexicans call it. Last year, two-thirds of all export earnings came from oil, while nonoil exports stagnated. Investment was channeled into massive industrial projects while agriculture languished, and in 1980 the nation was forced to spend an unprecedented $2 billion on grain imports. Foreign-made luxury goods flooded the market to please elite consumers while the inflation rate rose almost 60 percent in a year.
Meanwhile, Pemex has been accumulating economic and political power. So influential has the organization become that Diaz Serrano is considered a possible - albeit unlikely - successor to Lopez Portillo. ''Pemex has become a state within a state,'' one leftist politician said. ''No one can control it. It does exactly as it pleases. It has so much money that it can buy anyone.''
Nowhere is the oil fever higher than on the offshore platforms in Campeche Sound in the Gulf of Mexico, some 50 miles north of Ciudad del Carmen. It was only a hunch that the major onshore reserves in southeast Mexico might extend to the continental shelf, but Pemex began drilling in the area in 1977 and was immediately lucky: Well after well proved commercially viable. (Even the disastrous oil spill of the summer of 1979, when the Ixtoc offshore well poured millions of barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico for nine months, before being capped, revealed a new field containing 800 million barrels of oil.) Since June 1979, when crude began to flow through a 36-inchwide pipe to the coast, offshore production has risen to a million barrels a day. To Luciano Flores Plauchu, Pemex's local superintendent, it all seems like a dream. ''At the moment, we don't have the equipment to carry out new explorations,'' he said. ''Rather, we're just trying to define the limits of the 13 fields that we have already found.'' It is a public secret, though, that the oil-bearing geological structures are believed to extend all the way around the Yucatan Peninsula.
The Campeche wells are averaging a remarkable 30,000 barrels a day, but Pemex plans an entirely different approach for the Chicontepec deposits in northern Veracruz, where some 16,000 low-output wells are to be drilled over the next 13 years. Exploration is also under way in other areas, and commercial quantities of gas have been found offshore in the Pacific opposite the western state of Nayarit, and of oil onshore in nearby Jalisco state. Huge dry gas deposits have been struck in the Sabinas Valley near the United States border.
But oil wealth imposes its own development model, gobbling up an ever larger share of the federal budget. Exploration leads to exploitation and natural gas requires treatment plants and pipelines, and crude oil demands an expanded tanker fleet, new ports, pipelines, refineries and petrochemical complexes. In five years, Pemex's staff has jumped from 80,000 to 120,000, prompting the company to start construction of a 55-floor headquarters in Mexico City. And all of this expansion -Pemex's budget this year is more than $23 billion - has distorted economic growth.
Agriculture, probably the weakest sector of the economy, was the first area to go into crisis through neglect. The Government became alarmed, though, not when social conditions began to deteriorate because of the cutback in welfare spending, but when vast quantities of food had to be imported from the United States to supply urban areas. Facing the oil-for-food specter so common among oildeveloping countries, recognizing the absurdity of importing American food when Mexican farm laborers must go to the United States to find work, the Government has now pledged to make Mexico self-sufficient in basic grains by 1985.
Similarly, the transportion system, scarcely improved in decades, has come close to collapse under the pressure of food and machinery imports. The railroads, for example, are essentially those ridden by Pancho Villa and his rebel troops 65 years ago. The antiquated ports are the relic of a country that traditionally conducted two-thirds of its total foreign trade overland with the United States. Even the highways were built to bear perhaps one-fifth of today's traffic. Now the Government is trying to break through these bottlenecks with massive spending.
Primed by such expenditures, the economy has exploded into activity over the past three years, with the private sector rushing to catch up with demand - not only for consumer goods, but for machinery and raw materials as well. Imports soared from $5.8 billion in 1977 to around $20 billion last year. Just during 1980, total foreign investment, most of it American, rose by $1.4 billion dollars to $8.2 billion.
After the lean years for business under President Echeverria in the early 1970's, it is not surprising that Lopez Portillo's administration is applauded by the private sector. The Government has kept the lid on wages despite inflation. It has also provided business with generous fiscal incentives and increased subsidies for energy, raw materials and public utilities.
And big business has flourished as never before. Last year, the country's two largest private banks, Bancomer and Banamex, each with assets exceeding $10 billion, increased their profits by 66 percent and 71 percent, respectively. Many large corporations, such as the Alfa and Visa groups, have diversified their activities and grown into powerful, American-style conglomerates. Alfa's interests, for example, range from steelmaking to tourism; Visa's, from brewing to fishing.
Some economists, both inside and outside the Government, are worried that the advent of a business-oriented Administration in Washington under President Reagan will tighten the bonds between these Mexican groups and American-owned transnational corporations, thus weakening the state's control of the economy. ''The thought that Mexican big business, United States big business and Washington should have a commonality of interests is, to say the least, alarming,'' one left-leaning official said.
The real price of the boom, though, is a seriously overheated economy. To avoid ''financial indigestion,'' the Mexican Government has ordered a leveling-off of oil production when it reaches 2.7 million barrels a day sometime next year, but the surfeit of funds has already exacerbated inflation. The administration has nevertheless decided to live with inflation, arguing that the alternative - an economic slowdown - would be catastrophic for employment levels. In fact, officials argue that rapid growth and high Government spending should help create four million new jobs by 1982. And it believes that only by means of additional jobs - rather than welfare spending - will social conditions permanently improve for the poor. The Government is looking for a dramatic transformation of society, with an end to chronic unemployment, deep rural poverty and sprawling city slums by the year 2000. Most Mexicans, though, worry only about getting through today. The dimensions of Mexico's social crisis are intimidating. The country's population growth rate, though down from 3.5 percent in 1974 to 2.9 percent today, will raise the number of inhabitants from today's 70 million to at least 104 million by the year 2000. The distribution of the population is dangerously polarized between huge, unmanageable cities - Mexico City, soon to be the largest city in the world, already has 14 million residents - and some 95,000 remote communities. About 43 percent of all Mexicans are under the age of 14 years, placing enormous strains on educational and health services. In 1978, nine million Mexicans above the age of 15 had never attended school. Nationwide, 43 percent of all deaths involve children under the age of 5. Some 60 percent of the population is undernourished, with food intake per capita having fallen steadily over the past decade because of poor agricultural performances. Both urban and rural housing are sorely inadequate, with 69 percent of the population living in homes of just one or two rooms.
Last year, the Government began to channel some oil money toward Mexico's poorest 15 million people, at least half of them Indians living in remote areas. It created a special department to help those outside the money economy and beyond the normal reach of welfare agencies. By the end of 1982, it will have spent $4 billion on basic foods, drinking water and health services. Some 40 new rural medical clinics are already operating. ''It means the Indians now walk two or three hours instead of two or three days for treatment,'' explained Ignacio Leon Pacheco, who is in charge of assistance to the Tarahumaras Indians. ''I really think we're beginning to make progress.'' Dozens of Government grain warehouses have also been established, and they are beginning to break the power of unscrupulous middlemen who often charge the rural poor prices twice as high as in the cities.
The long-term answer to the peasant crisis, though, must lie in reducing the rural population. One ''escape valve,'' of course, is illegal emigration to the United States. Mexico estimates that between 450,000 and 1.4 million of its citizens work without proper documentation in the United States each year. But most peasants who leave the countryside prefer to move in with relatives already settled in Mexican cities. Even in the worst urban slums, with their open sewers and cardboard shacks, squatters can usually find temporary work, their children can attend school and, in emergencies, a doctor can be called. In the Santo Domingo slum of Mexico City, Mrs. Carmelita Gonzalez di Guevara said she preferred her two-room shack to village life in the state of Guanajuato. ''Things are difficult here, but they're worse in the pueblos,'' she said. ''My cousins have just arrived here because the drought spoiled their corn crop.''
In practice, half the labor force is under-employed - outright unemployment is only about 8 percent - and receives less than the legal minimum, either because workers are underpaid by employers or because they toil as carwashers and newspaper vendors or simply because they are kept busy only four months of the year, at harvest time. And even those Mexicans who are permanently employed have found their buying power shrinking. Jose Enrique Garcia, a 34-year-old office clerk who receives annual wage hikes and now earns $600 per month, complained that the rent on his two-bedroom apartment had just jumped by 70 percent. ''We feel the squeeze all the time,'' said this father of two. ''We don't eat out anymore. And forget about vacations: I work through mine to get paid extra.''
Against this background, the spending spree of the wealthy seems almost unreal. Statistics on income distribution can be deceptive, but the World Bank estimated that, in 1977, the top 20 percent of households received 57.7 percent of Mexico's income, while the bottom 20 percent received just 2.9 percent. The dramatic growth in demand for consumer goods -the Aurrera supermarket chain announced a 75 percent increase in profits during the third quarter of last year compared with the same period in 1979 - nevertheless suggests that new wealth is being accumulated, not only by top industrialists and bankers, but also by professionals, civil servants and skilled, unionized workers.
All over Mexico City, apartment and office buildings are going up and are often sold before the first earth is moved. In the affluent Bosques de las Lomas neighborhood, some 60 permits are issued each month for new homes costing an average $400,000 each - in cash, because mortgages, at 26 percent annual interest, are available only for cheaper houses. The demand for new cars is strong, even though locally made gas-guzzling Ford LTD's sell for almost $30,000 apiece.
The son of one prominent politician has gone beyond Fords; he collects Rolls-Royces, even though discretion prevents him from riding around in them. Some industrialists have added homes in New York or California or Padre Island, Tex., to their mansions in Mexico City, their rural haciendas and their villas by the beach - and, of course, they've bought executive jets to fly between them. Others have purchased $100,000 racing horses to improve their stables, or prefer to invest in paintings. One leading banker recently estimated that there are more than 200 Mexicans worth at least $100 million dollars. Mexicans are proud of the stability they have enjoyed for the past 60 years. The country's political system is an unusual mixture of authoritarianism and democracy. The President enjoys almost mystical power, personifying the nation as did the Aztec Emperor and Spanish Viceroy; yet, according to the Constitution, he must step down after six years in office. The Institutional Revolutionary Party (P.R.I.) has been in power without interruption since 1929, although six small parties are also represented in Congress. The system has undergone numerous crises and survived.
But now it is facing a new challenge, a widespread discontent to which the system has been unable to respond adequately. Because neither the P.R.I. nor the opposition parties, which include the Communists, enjoy much credibility, the simmering anger of many Mexicans takes no visible form. Yet it undeniably exists, particularly among the urban poor, who are more politicized than their peasant cousins, and among the middle classes, who are irritated by the conspicuous consumption of the wealthy and by the belief that much of the Government is corrupt. (The most common practice is for officials to be partners in companies that receive huge contracts from the Government -above all, for construction work in Mexico City and the oil regions.) The resentful silence of the majority has therefore become a greater political worry than the angry shouts of a few leftists. Recalling that both the 1910 revolution and the massive anti-Government protest movement in 1968 came without apparent warning, one P.R.I. Congressman noted worriedly: ''Nothing ever happens in Mexico - until it happens.''
Over the last four years, the politicians have lost ground to the technocrats who now dominate the administration. In part, this is attributable to President Lopez Portillo, himself a former finance minister who came to power with no strong political organization of his own. In part, it is a function of an economy in which Government spending accounts for almost half the gross domestic product. But the net result is that power is exercised by bright young planners with doctorates in economics from Harvard or the Sorbonne. Their authority depends entirely on that of the President, while politicians who have climbed through the ranks and are in touch with grass-roots sentiment have little voice.
In the present mood of uncertainty, then, political attention is increasingly focused on who will succeed President Lopez Portillo. Following tradition, the outgoing President can pick the P.R.I.'s candidate for the July 1982 elections, which, like his nine predecessors, he will win. No one knows what criteria will guide Lopez Portillo's choice. Until the candidate's ''destapamiento'' - or ''unhooding'' - next fall, a busy ''phantom'' campaign will continue as different aspirants jockey for position, trying to influence the outcome by showing their best face to the President. Most Mexicans are hardly aware of this struggle, and even the contenders themselves must publicly deny any interest in the succession, though politicians are already thinking of little else.
More than usual is at stake in the upcoming succession, but no one can know what policies the chosen successor will adopt until he takes office. For the first time in his political career, he will not be trying to please his immediate superior and he can at last ''unmask'' his true self.
Gradually, though, a consensus is emerging that the next President must give politicians a louder voice in determining economic policy. After all, the argument is increasingly heard, Mexico has always needed a strong Government in order to remain stable. And, in the past, it has been the politicians who have known when to be flexible, when to be populist - even when to be repressive - to insure the system's survival. Further, the fear is occasionally voiced that, unless the politicians provide clear leadership, the army will do so. The military has been skillfully kept out of politics by successive civilian administrations over the past 35 years, but under President Lopez Portillo, the Minister of Defense, Gen. Felix Galvan Lopez, has been unusually vocal, not only calling for modernization of the still small and ill-equipped armed forces, but also freely offering his opinion on a wide range of political issues.
The dominating challenge for the next administration, though, will be the effects and opportunities of Mexico's oil bounty. ''The differences between the rich and poor are becoming more acute,'' Heberto Castillo, leader of the small Mexican Workers Party, wrote recently. ''The people know that the rich include Government officials. No one believes that a senior Government official can be poor, while 70 percent of Mexicans, some 50 million people, live in conditions that become more precarious by the day.'' One Mexican analyst noted cynically that Mexicans do not suffer from unfulfilled expectations ''because they never expected to see any of the oil wealth.'' But surely they never expected oil to make them poorer. On the international stage, oil has given Mexico the confidence to raise its voice. This year, the country took a seat on the United Nations Security Council for the first time since 1946, while next June it expects to play host to an unprecedented ''North-South'' summit to be attended by the leaders of some 25 industrialized and developing nations. Just last month, Mexico unilaterally renounced all remaining fishing agreements with the United States, arguing, in the words of one official, that ''there is no reason to allow the United States to fish in our waters if there is no reciprocity.'' The reciprocity he apparently had in mind was the allocation to Mexico of a quota for catching squid off the New England coast. Washington has refused to grant the quota.
In its own back yard of the Caribbean basin, Mexico has begun to compete with the United States and Cuba for political leadership, criticizing Washington's support for El Salvador's civilian-military junta, challenging Cuba's erstwhile monopoly over revolutionary causes. Some officials in Washington have been angered by Mexico's political support for the leftist opposition groups trying to oust the United States-backed regime in El Salvador. Others have been upset by Mexico's warm ties with Cuba, failing to see them as an assertion of Mexico's independence from Washington. Mexico has also moved to prevent economic crises from fomenting political unrest by joining with Venezuela in a scheme to provide cheap oil to nine small nations of the region. And it has already rejected the idea, promoted by Ronald Reagan during the election campaign, of a North American common market comprising Mexico, Canada and the United States. Mexico sees the notion as an American gambit to obtain greater supplies of its oil.
This new independence has led to a series of small crises in bilateral relations, with Mexico seemingly ready to escalate minor differences into tests of national honor. Disputes over such issues as the price of Mexican natural-gas exports and a drought blamed on United States hurricane-chaser aircraft have turned into fiestas of Mexican nationalism. After the Ixtoc offshore-oil blowout damaged Texas beaches in 1979, Mexico angrily rejected charges that it was responsible for the accident and refused to pay compensation. Last fall, when President Lopez Portillo angered Washington by blocking the late Shah of Iran's return to exile in Mexico, he argued curtly that Mexico should not become embroiled ''in a conflict which is not ours.''
But Mexico's bravado abroad also reflects a heightened sense of insecurity, a fear that United States policy toward Mexico is motivated essentially by the need to gain access to Mexican oil - up to and including a takeover, as a last resort, of the Mexican oil fields. Its principal foreign-policy objective is therefore to convince Washington that Mexico is not the answer to its energy problem.
Mexico has decided neither to send to any single country more than 50 percent of its exports nor to supply any country with more than 20 percent of its oil imports. This policy was adopted, Foreign Minister Jorge Castaneda explained, ''not so much because of the risk that an excessive share of sales to the United States would increase our dependence, but because of the greater danger that the United States would become excessively dependent on Mexican oil.''
Not surprisingly, Washington has been frustrated by Mexico's policy and irritated by its general uppishness. A few United States officials have even talked of ''teaching Mexico a lesson,'' perhaps linking food sales to increased availability of Mexican oil, but calmer heads have prevailed. During the recent United States Presidential campaign, both candidates pledged to continue working for closer relations with Mexico, recognizing perhaps that the prime United States interest in Mexico is the preservation of political stability. Nothwithstanding Mexico's need to score occasional nationalist points against Washington, Mexico remains dependent on the United States -as a source of food, tourism and credit, as a natural market for its manufactured and agricultural products as well as energy exports, and as an escape valve for undocumented migrants. Its relations with Washington have always ultimately been dictated by pragmatism. Thus, for example, though Mexico follows the pricing policies of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, it has never joined the cartel, in large measure because doing so would have involved the loss of certain trading benefits with the United States.
This pragmatism was evident in Mexico's response to Ronald Reagan's victory last November. At first, officials reacted nervously to the prospect of a conservative, probusiness Administration in Washington. But, within weeks, they concluded that bilateral relations might even improve, with a President Reagan less likely than a Democratic President to curb illegal migration under pressure from organized labor. It is only over policy toward Central America, where the Reagan Administration is perceived as more prone than President Carter's to intervene, that Mexicans fear a clash with Washington. But even there, Lopez Portillo is clearly hopeful of persuading Reagan that a ''hands-off'' policy would be more prudent.
The peril to the United States, then, lies not in any excess of Mexican nationalism or independence, but rather in a mishandling of its oil wealth that could tumble the country into political chaos. A tightening of United States borders to Mexican products, large-scale deportation of illegal aliens and greater pressure on Mexico to increase its oil exports could all prove counterproductive for the United States. ''We cannot in the present situation take into account interests other than our own,'' Jorge Castaneda told an American audience last June, ''but the results will be beneficial to you and to us.'' Four years ago, Mexico's oil finds seemed like a miracle, but they have still to be proved a blessing.

Full text: Special to The New York Times
Fidel Castro, the Cuban President, said today that he was ready to accept ''the olive branch'' from the United States, but expressed deep concern that Ronald Reagan's foreign policy as President would be a threat to Latin America and world peace.
''If you give us the olive branch, we won't reject it,'' he told 1,800 cheering guests and delegates from around the world at the Second Communist Party Congress. But he also warned, ''If you continue the hostility and make aggression we will respond energetically.''
He said that any military intervention by the United States in Central America could lead to a ''defeat greater than Vietnam'' for the United States.
''Those who go to kill people in Central America will have to be ready to die,'' he said, adding that ''no one is threatening the United States,'' but no onewill accept ''the threats of the United States against our lives.''
In a speech that began at 10 in the morning and continued until 10:15 P.M. with breaks for lunch and dinner, Mr. Castro, for the first time, reviewed Mr. Reagan's campaign pronouncements about a Western Hemisphere fraught with uncertainty and danger.
He reaffirmed Cuba's commitment to Communism and said Cuba was ready to work toward a ''reasonable and constructive agreement'' on Cuban emigration to the United States.
Mr. Castro warned that Cuba would authorize visas for Cubans to leave the country any way they could if progress was not made toward resolving several issues, including the reunion of families, and if the United States continued to follow what he described as a policy of stimulating illegal immigration.
''Mariel is not resolved, Mariel is simply suspended,'' he said. ''The United States created this problem. It is up to them to solve it.''
Mr. Castro said that Cuba has been trying to figure out Mr. Reagan's views on world affairs by examining the Republican platform, Mr. Reagan's speeches and statements by his advisers, but the Cuban President concluded that nobody knows what Mr. Reagan's plans are.
He ridiculed Mr. Reagan's avowed interest in more armaments for the United States and a buildup of armed forces as ''simply absurd'' and said it was a policy that could not be justified in the nuclear age.
After warning against military intervention elsewhere in Central America, Mr. Castro recalled that Mr. Reagan had talked about the possibility of a new blocade against Cuba, or the possibility that Cuba might be blockaded in retaliation against the Soviet Union. He called this view ''repugnant.''
His lengthly speech, given in the auditorium of the Palace of the Convention, was greeted with tremendous enthusiasm. There were standing ovations in response to his warnings and statements directed at the United States.
Wearing a dress army uniform of olive green, tie and white shirt rather than his customary fatigues, Mr. Castro spoke on a stage hung with a red curtain where protraits of Lenin, Marx, and Jose Marti, the George Washington, of the Cuban Revolution, were displayed.
He said that during the early months of the Carter Administration it looked as if some normalization of relations between the two countries might be possible, but then relations deteriorated.
Mr. Castro attributed Mr. Reagan's victory at the polls to inflation and unemployment in the United States ''in particular among blacks and young people'' and a ''feeling of frustration and skepticism among the people.''

Economic Scene; Arms Budget's Heavy Impact

Abstract: The United States, preoccupied by the military rivalry with the Soviet Union, may well have ignored the more important economic rivalry with its O.E.C.D. allies. One step among the many required to put the United States on an equal competitive footing may well be to insist that equal shares of G.N.P. be devoted to national defense among the O.E.C.D. countries. --------------------------------------------------------------------- Leonard Silk is on vacation.

Full text: WHEN the Presidential candidates' positions on national defense are examined, the focus invariably is on the balance of military power between the United States and the Soviet Union. The effect on the American economy is usually ignored.
By conventional wisdom, defense spending is a boon to the economy. Increased outlays for the military, especially on hardware, represent an addition to aggregate demand and therefore stimulate the economy, leading to higher levels of output and employment.
Indeed, there are many, both on the left and on the right, who believe that the postwar prosperity of the United States has been undergirded by high levels of spending on national defense. There is historical evidence to support this view: The recovery from the 1949 recession was clearly aided by the outbreak of hostilities in Korea a year later and the higher growth rates of the 1960's were achieved only after President Kennedy succeeded in persuading Congress that, in light of the Berlin crisis, defense spending should be increased by 50 percent.
From this perspective, then, President Carter's plans to increase defense spending by 3 percent in real terms should be seen as a boon to the economy. The President's military budget would, in fact, help to speed the recovery from the recession that the Carter Administration has produced as a palliative for inflation. And Governor Reagan's proposal to increase defense spending by 5 percent in real terms would be an even greater boon.
But this is to look at only one side - the demand side - of the effect that defense spending has on the economy. There is also a supply-side effect.
On the supply side, defense spending represents a diversion of resources from other uses. The same is true, of course, of spending on consumption goods and of spending on investment goods (new plant and equipment). But spending on consumption goods at least adds to the material well-being of those who obtain the goods. And spending on investment goods at least serves to increase the economy's capacity to produce other goods.
Spending on national defense does neither. It simply represents a diversion of resources from consumption and, especially, if economic growth is a major concern, from the investment required to achieve higher rates of economic growth.
It is hardly surprising, therefore, that if one looks at the record of economic growth of the countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, including the United States, one observes a strong inverse relationship between the portion of gross national product devoted to national defense and the growth rate over time. As can be seen from the accompanying table, the United States, which devotes by far the highest portion of its G.N.P. to defense spending, has one of the lowest growth rates among the O.E.C.D. countries. Conversely, Japan, with by far the lowest portion of its G.N.P. devoted to national defense, has the highest growth rate.
This is not to argue that the share of G.N.P. devoted to national defense is the only factor that need be taken into account in explaining the growth of different economies. Other factors are important, too, among them the extent to which an economy experiences cyclical fluctuations. Still, because of the supply-side effect, the importance of the share of G.N.P. devoted to defense should not be overlooked. History is replete with examples of countries that squandered economic opportunities by devoting too great a share of their resources to military ends.
History is also replete with examples of countries that, being unwilling or unable to make adequate provisions for defense, have been swallowed up by neighboring states. Obviously, in a world without an overriding police authority to assure peaceful relations among countries, some portion of the G.N.P. devoted to defense spending is unavoidable.
Still, the disparities shown in the accompanying table are striking. It is not immediately clear why the United States, which among the O.E.C.D. countries faces the least danger of actual invasion should need to devote so much larger a share of its G.N.P. to national defense.
One can, of course, argue that a need exists for the United States to serve as the world's policeman, in enforcing a Pax Americana. But it is not clear how relevant this argument remains when most other countries would reject any such role for this country. The argument is particularly suspect in light of the recent success of other O.E.C.D. countries, especially West Germany, France and Japan, in nearly matching - if not actually overtaking - the United States in per capita income.
The United States, preoccupied by the military rivalry with the Soviet Union, may well have ignored the more important economic rivalry with its O.E.C.D. allies. One step among the many required to put the United States on an equal competitive footing may well be to insist that equal shares of G.N.P. be devoted to national defense among the O.E.C.D. countries. --------------------------------------------------------------------- Leonard Silk is on vacation.

Full text: Canada, France and Great Britain
By PAUL LEWIS VENICE THE annual economic summit meeting of the seven major industrial democracies has a different atmosphere about it this year. Disarray among the allies on political issues is overshadowing economic dialogue, and there is also a sense that common economic problems have become so intractable that decisions made here won't help much to solve them.
The participants - the United States, Britain, Canada, France, Italy, West Germany and Japan - have already committed themselves to policies of restraint and slowed growth to fight inflation, which leaves little scope for brave new initiatives. The governments and their electorates appear to understand more clearly than in the past that there seems to be no painless escape from the combination of recession and inflation that higher oil prices impose.
Moreover, the disappointments of the last few years, as inflation and unemployment continued to edge steadily higher, have destroyed the belief that the governments can control the world economy. As the Canadian Deputy Prime Minister, Allan Maceachen, said recently, ''We just don't have much room for maneuver any more.''
The summit meeting, which is scheduled to get under way today at the island monastery of San Giorgio Maggiore, is eclipsed by differences over the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan, the American hostages in Iran and the Palestinian issue.
''Its a political summit as much as an economic one this time,'' said a member of the committee from the seven governments that prepared for the summit talks.
Energy, which dominated the agenda of the Tokyo summit meeting last year, is no less of a dilemma this year, even though the decline of the American economy has eased some of the pressure on oil prices. The price increases continue, however, threatening the West with a perpetual recession.
In addition, the sharp rises of oil prices in 1979 and the smaller increases so far this year pose still another headache for the world's developing countries, whose ability to absorb more debt is in some cases already exhausted. At a meeting here of European leaders last weekend, Chancellor Helmut Schmidt of West Germany warned that third-world bankruptcies next year could drag down the industrial economies.
Protectionism is likely to be an issue, too. Protectionist sympathies in the United States are the strongest they have been in a generation, partly because of the immense success of Japanese and German automobiles in the American market.
Here's how the conference's principal themes show up in the context of the participating economies: RECESSION in the United States, coming faster than expected, may reinforce the downturn developing in Europe and Japan, sending the major economies marching off into a synchronized slump such as in 1975. The risk is heightened by the danger that governments will overdo their inflation-fighting.
But the leaders President Carter plans to meet in Venice fear premature stimulation of the United States economy brought on by election-year pressures more than a protracted recession. A surrender in America's fight against inflation would most likely bring a rush out of the dollar that could tear the European Monetary System apart and invite OPEC to raise oil prices again.
Pressures for a tax cut and other forms of economic stimulation have increased with the report last week that the United States gross national product, according to preliminary Government estimates, plunged at an annual rate of 8.5 percent in the second quarter. That drop would be second only to the 9.1 percent plunge in the first quarter of 1975. Unemployment last month was 7.8 percent of the labor force. Inflation has improved, however. The Consumer Price Index increased at an annual rate of slightly over 11 percent in April, compared with an 18 percent rate in the first quarter.
What also worries European and Japanese leaders is the likelihood that protectionist pressures will intensify as the recession in the United States deepens. Western leaders have done a better job than many expected in preserving free trade in recent years. But the clamor in the United States for action against foreign steel and other imports now threatens to undo the work, just when recessionary forces are increasing in Europe and America and the world can least afford a trade war.
The rejection by Congress of Mr. Carter's proposed oil import fee, which was designed to conserve oil, is expected to damage Mr. Carter's credibility as a leader on energy. Mr. Carter wants the meeting to accept a strong statement on saving oil and developing coal and other alternative energy sources.
The American downturn would have come sooner if Americans had not fought it off by spending their savings, thus encouraging manufacturers to go on investing. But now Americans are building up their savings again, uncovering what European economists like to call the ''concealed recession.''
A 4.8 percent April fall in the index of leading indictors followed by a 2.1 percent decline in industrial production in May show the downturn will be more brutal than the Administration had expected. How long will it last? With housing starts and retail sales collapsing at record rates and corporations starting to cut back investment plans, a sizable downturn could be under way by Election Day.
ECONOMIC growth in Japan promises to be stronger than almost anywhere else in the industrial world this year, reaching 4.8 percent, according to the Government's own forecasts, or twice Europe's likely average and not far below the 6 percent rate Japan achieved in 1978 and 1979.
Inflation is high at nearly 10 percent but not calamitously so with wages expected to rise 7 percent this year and likely to pay for themselves through a matching increase in productivity.
Japan has shed its traditional large surplus of exports over imports as a result of rising oil prices and lower currency values, and is likely to run a deficit of some $12 billion this year.
Other countries fear that Japan may get back on the export trail too soon for international comfort, reducing its own deficit but adding to those of weaker countries. Merrill Lynch Economics Inc., in an international review, says an export-led recovery may develop later this year, or next year as the United States begins to pull out of its recession. The rapid decline in interest rates in the United States, it says, has taken the pressure off the yen as well as Japanese interest rates. Despite its recent strength, the yen is still 8 percent below its peak of last year.
An export-led recovery would be bad news for Detroit, which sees the flood of Japanese cars to the United States as a cause of some of its problems. The United Automobile Workers has been clamoring for Government relief from the imports and has sought commitments from the Japanese to build their cars in plants in the United States.
Japan's political problems are paramount at the moment. The nation is in a political vacuum after the unexpected death June 12 of Prime Minister Masayoshi Ohira of a heart attack. Elections were being held today to elect the upper and lower houses of Parliament, and a new Prime Minister won't be named until later.
Japan is being represented at Venice by Foreign Minister Saburo Okita and the Ministers of Finance and International Trade and Industry. They are not expected to make any forceful decisions on Japan's part. WEST GERMANY in recent weeks has seen a scaling down in forecasts for the economy's performance this year. At first the Bundesbank hoped for 4 percent growth, not far off last year's 4.5 percent performance. Now it sees 3 percent growth and the Government 2.5 percent. The latest business survey was starkly pessimistic with most industrialists forecasting sharply lower orders and reduced investment.
But while the Wagnerian gloom builds up, the Government has surrendered its traditional payments surplus under the impact of rising oil prices and weak export demand. This year Germany is likely to run a deficit of more than $14 billion.
The worry is that Germany will continue to fight inflation - at 5.7 percent still one of the lowest rates in the world - with tightmoney policies and an appreciating mark. This means increased pressure on everyone else to keep interest rates high and lower growth all around. Germany holds the key to a synchronized deep downturn the central bankers worry about.
Another fear haunts many European policy makers. Lower growth could help Germany export its way back into surplus in a year or so, as it did after the first big oil price explosion. But as the German deficit shrinks, the deficits of the developing world would swell, bringing new risks of bankruptcies, loan defaults and financial panic.
Chancellor Helmut Schmidt has asked President Carter to meet with him personally during the Venice meeting, apparently to avoid a public rift that could be developing over Mr. Schmidt's plans to visit Moscow June 30.
AFTER topping Europe last year with growth of 5 percent, Italy may lead the continent again in growth this year with a 3.5 percent rate of economic expansion.
Italy is turning in another strong performance in defiance of all the laws of economic gravity. Inflation is over 20 percent; the balance of payments is in deficit; Government spending is out of control; the Prime Minister faces impeachment; the central bank governor is under indictment - and the lira has unaccountably become one of Europe's strongest currencies.
''Our success often seems a little unbelievable, even to ourselves,'' comments Bruno Brovedani, chief economist at the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro.
As a country without oil or coal of its own and one that enjoys good relations with the Arab world, Italian officials say Prime Minister Francesco Cossiga will press the leaders at Venice to follow Europe's example and make a determined effort to open negotiations with OPEC on oil pricing.
WITH an anticipated growth rate of 2.5 per cent this year, France is also weathering current economic storms quite well, although it has no oil or other raw materials of its own. Activity is expected to slow later this year, but as yet there is no sign of a real recession developing.
Much of the credit belongs to Prime Minister Raymond Barre, who ended price controls and took other economic liberalization measures that have enabled French companies to turn in exceptionally good profits last year, helping underpin an investment boom the authorities hope will keep the economy strong through 1981.
International confidence in Mr. Barre's policies also helps explain why the franc has remained strong, despite rising inflation, which is expected to top 12 percent this year, and an anticipated payments deficit of around $5 billion.
President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, who faces elections next year, is acutely aware that the the increase in oil prices has destroyed France's much publicized plans to reduce both unemployment and inflation this year.
The country already has the most advanced and ambitious nuclear power program in the West, as well as one of the toughest oil conservation programs.
At Venice, no Western leader will be a more eloquent proponent of the view that energy is the key to Western recovery than President Giscard d'Estaing. He is also one of the most vocal critics of America's failure to curb its oil consumption faster and reduce the upward pressure on prices.
BRITAIN, like the United States, is a major weak spot in the Western economic picture this year. Growth is expected to be negative, with the economy contracting by around 2.5 percent. Unemployment is climbing steadily, inflation is unlikely to fall below 16 percent on average and the balance of payments will be about $1 billion in the red. This dismal performance is made more lamentable by the fact that Britain is self-sufficent in energy, thanks to its North Sea oil and gas fields. Britain's weakened economy can make little contribution to Western recovery for some time to come.
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher is probably the strongest proponent among the seven Western leaders of the current economic orthodoxy that holds that conquering inflation, learning to use less energy and preserving free trade are the overwhelming priorities for Western economic policy makers at the moment.
Mrs. Thatcher and the Foreign Secretary, Lord Carrington, have warned repeatedly in recent weeks that the major threat to Western economies at the moment is the political one posed by the explosive Middle East situation and the danger of an interruption in oil supplies. At Venice, Mrs. Thatcher can be expected to argue that a Middle East peace settlement is of fundamental importance for the health of Western economies.
THE defeat of the Quebec separatists in last month's referendum in Canada has removed a major political uncertainty that had been hanging over the Canadian economy.
But it will not prevent Canada from being dragged down into whatever kind of a recession develops in the United States, which still takes over 70 percent of its exports.
Despite his liberal credentials, Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau is following his other summit colleagues in putting all the emphasis on inflation-fighting in his economic policy these days.
At Venice, officials expect him to press the economic case for doing more to sustain third-world development as a way of keeping growth alive in the West.

Abstract: ''Price stability exists in Germany only in the figures statisticians keep,'' according to a story in the mass circulation magazine ''Quick.'' ''The published inflation rate of 5.8 percent is simply wrong. In reality prices are rising at a rate more like 12 percent.'' ''Germany's inflation rate is not 6 percent, but much higher,'' the newspaper began, aping its opponents. ''False claims like that turn up whenever Germany's inflation rate is compared with that of the United States.'' ''In the German case, you're talking about pure statistics, in our case about a perspective, a prognosis,'' an American economist in Bonn said. ''The problem is, when Germans compare their figures with the American rate, they too often take the compounded rate, without noticing the difference.''

Full text: Inflation, like beauty, is in the eye of the beholder. That is the conclusion of some West German economists who say that Germany's remarkably low inflation rate, a startling comparison with that of the United States, is in part cosmetic.
Using the same yardstick as the United States, and juggling the basket of consumer goods on which the country's consumer price index is based, they say West Germany's rate of inflation, rather than hovering at the modest 5 to 6 percent reported officially, might actually be a volatile 12 or 13 percent.
On the other side of this skirmish, which is being waged in popular magazines, weighty financial-page articles and banking newsletters, are economists and state statisticians, who defend both their yardsticks and their numbers, and say the United States is grossly exaggerating its price growth.
Specious Arguments
''Price stability exists in Germany only in the figures statisticians keep,'' according to a story in the mass circulation magazine ''Quick.'' ''The published inflation rate of 5.8 percent is simply wrong. In reality prices are rising at a rate more like 12 percent.''
On the other side, the respected Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung recently did battle in an article with what it inferred were specious arguments of the same sort.
''Germany's inflation rate is not 6 percent, but much higher,'' the newspaper began, aping its opponents. ''False claims like that turn up whenever Germany's inflation rate is compared with that of the United States.''
Part of the problem is that the price increases West German homemakers and consumer advocates register at the supermarket do not seem adequately reflected in the official inflation rate.
75% Rise in French Cheese
A recent study done by the consumer magazine ''DM'' pointed out that a three-pound loaf of bread their buyers bought in January cost 15 percent more in March. A package of imported French cheese cost 75 percent more, and the price of a can of soup was up almost 60 percent.
Those price increases may not be entirely typical for West Germany, but they have some economists wondering whether official statistics are more psychology than economics.
The psychology of inflation is extremely delicate in West Germany, where the legendary inflation of 1923 made postage stamps cost millions of marks, and a loaf of bread was paid for with bushels of worthless paper money. After World War II, galloping inflation again destroyed people's savings and made paupers of millionaires overnight.
Much of Chancellor Helmut Schmidt's international reputation rests on his country's moderate inflation rate. For years he successfully resisted the appeals of European leaders that Germany be the locomotive of the European economy, because he feared rampant inflation that Germans would not accept.
Methods for Figuring C.P.I.
Partly at issue are the methods used in West Germany and the United States to reach the figures that trace the growth of the consumer price index, the figure governments and economists use to represent the level of prices people pay for goods.
The inflation rate commonly quoted in West Germany and in most European countries represents the percentage by which consumer prices increase in any month of the current year from the same month of the year earlier.
Thus, Germany's reported 6.1 percent inflation in the month of May meant that the country's consumer prices, as measured by the Federal statistics office, were 6.1 percent higher this year than in May 1979.
But economists note that the figure Germans usually cite to measure inflation in the United States is an animal of another species. It represents the rise in consumer prices in any month, compared with the preceding month, and compounded - as interest on savings would be - monthly for an entire year.
Pure Statistics
To give an example of what a difference this can make, economists point out that when the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics said in February that America's annual rate of increase in consumer prices was 18 percent, the West Germans reported a comparatively low inflation rate of 5.6 percent. Using the American yardstick for that month, however, Germany's annual rate would have been 14 percent.
''In the German case, you're talking about pure statistics, in our case about a perspective, a prognosis,'' an American economist in Bonn said. ''The problem is, when Germans compare their figures with the American rate, they too often take the compounded rate, without noticing the difference.''
Though German economists admit their monetary officials use annual rates as well as year-to-year comparisons, they say the compounded rate grossly exaggerates short-term trends and does not allow for sporadic price movements that may not be repeated in the year.
Problems With Compounding
''The compounded figure is a hypothesis, and in 90 percent of the cases it's not going to be accurate,'' said Friedrich Marx, a statistician at the Federal Bureau of Statistics in Wiesbaden.
American economists admit that the Germans are partly right. ''At the start of the year, inflation in the United States was high, but if prices begin to level off, then the compounded rate will have distorted things,'' an American accountant in Frankfurt said.
Some critics say part of the inflation rate difference is due to differences in the basket of goods used to determine the consumer price index. Unlike the Germans, for example, the Americans included the cost of mortgage financing in the housing cost column.
''Since the middle of 1979 this has been a major inflationary factor in the United States, because high interest rates have dragged mortgage costs up. If the Americans used our basket, the results would be lower,'' Mr. Stalf said.
