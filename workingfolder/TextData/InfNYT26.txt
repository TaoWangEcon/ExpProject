Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration, in the wake of a promising first round of nuclear diplomacy with Iran, is weighing a proposal to ease the pain of sanctions on Tehran by offering it access to billions of dollars in frozen funds if the Iranian government takes specific steps to curb its nuclear program, a senior administration official said Thursday.
Such a plan, under which the United States could free up Iran's frozen overseas assets in installments, would avoid the political and diplomatic risks of repealing the sanctions, which had been agreed to by a diverse coalition of countries, the official said. It would also give President Obama the flexibility to respond to Iranian offers that emerge from the negotiations without unraveling the global sanctions regime the administration has spent years cobbling together.
The official likened the plan, which is still being debated inside the White House and the State Department, to opening and closing a financial spigot.
While the two days of talks in Geneva this week did not produce a breakthrough, Iranian officials were more candid and substantive than in previous diplomatic encounters, officials said, particularly in direct negotiations between Iranian diplomats and the senior American representative, Wendy R. Sherman.
Now, though, the administration faces a complex calculation on the future of the sanctions, which have been crucial in bringing the Iranians back to the bargaining table. Administration officials said they would urge the Senate to hold off on voting on a new bill to strangle Iran's oil exports further until after the next round of talks on Nov. 7.
That may be a tough case to make to lawmakers, given that Iran did not pledge to freeze its enrichment of uranium and offered no plan, publicly at least, to dismantle facilities, which State Department officials cited as a justification for holding off on a sanctions vote before the first meeting. Several senators issued statements saying the sanctions should go ahead.
Still, the positive tone of the talks -- a senior American diplomat who took part characterized them as "intense, detailed, straightforward, candid conversations" -- has prompted new thinking in Washington about how to ease the pressure on Tehran, if not immediately, then down the road, if the Iranians make real concessions.
The proposal on freeing up funds has been championed by Mark Dubowitz, executive director of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a public policy institute known for its hawkish views on Iran. "My biggest concern is that if the administration takes out a brick from the sanctions regime, you won't be able to put it back together," Mr. Dubowitz said. He called the plan "a way to provide nonsanctions financial relief to give the administration flexibility during the negotiations."
If Iran refused to make concessions, the United States, he said, could pair its offer to free Iranian money with a new sanction that would immediately freeze all of its foreign exchange reserves by cutting off from the American financial system any bank that gives Iran use of those funds.
A Senate Republican aide said the proposal was preferable to an earlier offer by the West -- rejected by Iran -- to lift a ban on trading in gold if Iran agreed to shut down its Fordo enrichment facility, which is built in a mountain near Qum.
"We thought that was a bad idea because it replenishes Iran's coffers," said the aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the delicacy of the subject. "In this case, the administration could come to Congress and ask, 'Is closing Fordo worth $1 billion?' "
While the proposal is tailored and flexible, skeptics say it might not satisfy the Iranians, whose goal is to get out from under all the sanctions that have devastated their currency, cut their oil exports in half, and left their economy with sky-high inflation and unemployment.
"The Iranians are looking for fundamental sanctions relief," said Ray Takeyh, an expert on Iran at the Council on Foreign Relations. "I'm not sure whether they'd accept phased access to their own money."
As the administration tries to devise new ways to relax the pressure on Iran, it faces another tightening of the vise, a Senate bill that aims to drive Iran's oil exports to zero. The House passed similar legislation in July, by a vote of 400 to 20. Senator Tim Johnson, a Democrat from South Dakota who is the chairman of the banking committee, told the administration he could not hold the bill beyond the end of October.
"Given Iran's refusal to halt its illicit nuclear and ballistic missile programs," said Senator Mark S. Kirk, an Illinois Republican and Iran hawk, "the Senate should immediately move forward with a new round of economic sanctions targeting all remaining Iranian government revenue and reserves."
With the Senate on recess in the aftermath of the government shutdown, however, Congressional aides said they now expected that the sanctions bill would not emerge from the committee and be ready for a floor vote until the eve of the next round of talks in Geneva.
That could allow the administration to use the specter of new sanctions as a prod to the Iranians to present more concrete proposals then. "It's always nice to go into these negotiations with some coercive leverage," Mr. Takeyh said, "because the Iranians have their own leverage: They're not stopping enrichment."
Ms. Sherman, the State Department under secretary who is leading the talks, plans to brief lawmakers in the coming days on the progress made in Geneva. The administration is clearly concerned about preserving a united front on sanctions. The State Department and the Treasury Department are sending officials to Europe on Friday to discuss technical aspects of the sanctions regime, an official said.
"Congress has been a very significant partner in putting that sanctions regime and architecture in place," a senior administration official told reporters in Geneva on Wednesday. "None of us want to undo it before we know we have some results that answer our concerns."
Despite the inconclusive nature of this week's talks, former administration officials urged Congress to wait another few weeks to give diplomacy a chance. Prematurely imposing punitive measures, they say, could provoke a backlash from Iran's hard-liners, who for now are backing President Hassan Rouhani's diplomatic overture.
"While additional sanctions may well prove necessary, we should hold off for now," said Robert Einhorn, a former State Department official who helped devise the sanctions. "We should remember that the existing sanctions are already having a devastating impact and provide substantial incentive for the Iranians to show the necessary flexibility."

Abstract: The worst of these was the transformation of a country that once relied entirely on its own sources for oil and natural gas into one that depends on imports, a draining of resources that has led to what many economists say is an annual inflation rate of 25 percent. Mr. Boudou was certainly not afraid -- to sing rock 'n' roll, to cruise around on his motorcycle, to smile ceaselessly and to rack up allegations: he is being investigated for corruption and illicit enrichment.

Full text:   EVERYONE knows the president fell, but nobody knows how, or when, or where. There are several theories in circulation about what happened to the Argentine president, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner: some say she tripped on the stairway of her plane, others say it was a lumpy rug, and still others say she fainted. People are also split on when it happened: either just before or just after the August primary for the midterm elections, when her party saw its lowest support in a decade.
By the time she was released from the hospital early this week, all we could agree on was that she'd had surgery after enduring a blow to the head, a blow that had produced the subdural hematoma that, over the past few days, has kept Argentina hanging in the balance.
This wasn't the first time our president had been hospitalized. She underwent surgery after a misdiagnosis of thyroid cancer in 2011. That was the year that Hugo Chávez, already ill, said he believed that someone (e.g., United States intelligence) "might have developed the technology to induce cancer" and was using it to murder Latin American leaders.
It's a tempting theory: the Colombian president Juan Manuel Santos had surgery for prostate cancer last year; the president of Paraguay, Fernando Lugo, as well as Brazil's two most recent presidents, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and Dilma Rousseff, have also battled malignant tumors. Mr. Chávez died after his battle with cancer this year.
The more likely explanation is that there is simply something about the exercise of power that does not seem to agree with those Latin Americans who attempt it.
Sickness, however, has a way of bringing on sympathy and affection from the public. In 2010, when her husband and the former president, Néstor Kirchner, died of a heart attack at 60, Mrs. Kirchner's support skyrocketed.
In certain countries, voters are inclined to abandon leaders who reveal physical or emotional weakness, but in Argentina it's the other way around. Just look at her party's campaign ads featuring shots of the candidate, Martín Insaurralde, with no hair as a result of chemotherapy treatments. In Argentine politics, sickness and death are key players.
Mrs. Kirchner -- whom doctors have advised to take a month off from work to recover -- needs that sympathy now more than ever. Her administration is suffering a seemingly never-ending string of errors. The worst of these was the transformation of a country that once relied entirely on its own sources for oil and natural gas into one that depends on imports, a draining of resources that has led to what many economists say is an annual inflation rate of 25 percent.
But her administration is also capable of infinite smaller errors that make everyday work that much more complicated. For example: the choice of Amado Boudou as her vice president. Mr. Boudou, the former finance minister, was never popular. But Mrs. Kirchner insisted that he be her running mate in 2011. "I need a man at my side who isn't afraid," she said at the time.
Mr. Boudou was certainly not afraid -- to sing rock 'n' roll, to cruise around on his motorcycle, to smile ceaselessly and to rack up allegations: he is being investigated for corruption and illicit enrichment. Mrs. Kirchner has been dogged by accusations of corruption of her own. But Mr. Boudou has succeeded in becoming the politician with the worst public image in Argentina, a country that, in general, does not look kindly upon its elected officials.
For this reason, Mrs. Kirchner has kept him out of the public eye and, when she fell ill, tried to put off or hide his temporary ascent to the presidency. For a couple of days, uncertainty reigned: nobody knew if Mr. Boudou was the interim president or not. Now we all know that he is, but apparently the power remains in Mrs. Kirchner's hands.
Some have joked that the only reason Mrs. Kirchner chose him was so that voters would dislike him so much, they would want her to stay in her presidential seat as long as possible. But it's not working.
This time around, it's becoming increasingly clear that not even the president's illness can attract enough support to help her reverse the electoral defeat that all the polls are predicting. For once, personal matters might be less important to voters than inflation, insecurity, inefficiency and all the accusations of corruption. Mrs. Kirchner's hopes of running again in 2015 seem to have been buried.
So after all, perhaps she will find herself cured of the ailment that, of all those suffered by Latin American politicians, is the most endemic: the re-election virus. In our part of the world, where leaders have been known to manipulate national institutions in order to retain their command, this is a rare event. For too many of them, executive power is the last shield against judicial power: between the two, they know for sure which one they prefer.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Containers of goods idling at ports. Reduced sales at sandwich shops in downtown Washington. Canceled vacations to national parks and to destinations abroad. Reduced corporate earnings forecasts. Higher interest payments on short-term debt.
Even with the shutdown of the United States government and the threat of a default coming to an end, the cost of Congress's gridlock has already run well into the billions, economists estimate. And the total will continue to grow even after the shutdown ends, partly because of uncertainty about whether lawmakers might reach another deadlock early next year.
A complete accounting will take months once the government reopens and the Treasury resumes adding to the country's debt. But economists said that the intransigence of House Republicans would take a bite out of fourth-quarter growth, which will affect employment, business earnings and borrowing costs. The ripple from Washington will be felt around the globe.
"We saw huge effects during the summer of 2011, with consumer confidence hitting a 31-year low in August and third-quarter G.D.P. growing just 1.4 percent," said Beth Ann Bovino, chief United States economist at Standard & Poor's, referring to earlier brinkmanship over the debt ceiling. "Given that this round of debt ceiling negotiations" took place during a shutdown, she said, "the impact on the economy could be even more severe."
Economists say the shutdown and near breach of the debt ceiling would be unlikely to derail the recovery, now that Congress resolved the impasse late Wednesday. In the weeks after the government reopens, there should be a modest rebound as employees spend their paychecks for the days they were on furlough and the government rushes to process backlogged orders.
Still, many businesses might not recover all the money they would have made had the government operated normally, said Shai Akabas of the Bipartisan Policy Center, a research group based in Washington.
The two-week shutdown has trimmed about 0.3 percentage point from fourth-quarter growth, or about $12 billion, the forecasting firm Macroeconomic Advisers, based in St. Louis, recently estimated. Standard & Poor's is more pessimistic, estimating that the shutdown will cut about 0.6 percent off inflation-adjusted gross domestic product, equivalent to $24 billion. Most analysts are predicting that growth will remain subpar, at an annual pace of 2 percent or less.
Moreover, this latest budget impasse came after years of similar episodes, and the economic ramifications have accumulated over time, analysts say. A new report from Macroeconomic Advisers, prepared for the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, estimates the costs of the fiscal uncertainty of the last few years. Its model suggests that uncertainty since late 2009 has increased certain corporate borrowing costs by 0.38 percentage point; lowered economic growth over that period by 0.3 percent a year, costing at least $150 billion in lost output; and left this year's unemployment rate higher by 0.6 percentage point. That translates to 900,000 jobs lost.
The unusually rapid pace of deficit reduction, concentrated on goods and services the government delivers, has had a further damping effect on growth, swamping the cost of the relatively brief shutdown, economists said. Macroeconomic Advisers estimated the impact at about 0.7 percentage points of G.D.P. a year, equivalent to over $300 billion in lost output over the last three years. Additional cuts would slow the economy even more, economists say.
"We are baffled by the idea that the pace of deficit reduction needs to be increased, given how rapidly the picture is improving already," Ian Shepherdson, the chief economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrote in a note to clients.
The 16-day shutdown itself has already led to the biggest plunge in consumer confidence since the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008. Howard R. Levine, the chief executive of Family Dollar Stores, said his customers, most with modest incomes, had pulled back on spending this month. "The threat of the shutdown, the uncertainty regarding some of the government assistance that our consumers receive, the uncertainty around job growth are very real to our customer every day," Mr. Levine said.
The gridlock also had ripple effects on many industries that rely on the federal government in one way or another. Import inspections, export financing and the issuance of oil and gas permits all slowed.
Residential real estate, which has been one of the brightest points of the recovery, suffered. An index of sentiment among home builders fell in October from a month earlier, according to data released on Wednesday from the National Association of Home Builders. The decline was greater than analysts had expected. One cause for the decline is that the approval process for government-backed mortgages has slowed with the shutdown.
The damage to business has been intensified by the timing of the shutdown. "We're in budget planning for 2014, so it casts a pall," said John Selldorff, who runs the American operations of Legrand, a global manufacturer of electrical and data products based in France. "We are definitely pausing and being more careful."
The impasse over the debt ceiling raised the United States' short-term borrowing costs, with investors demanding triple the interest payments they received just a few weeks ago, in some cases. Concerns about the United States as a borrower may have a much longer and deeper effect than the shutdown, analysts say.
"Even with a deal to avoid a default, the damage has been done by the fact that we have had a debate questioning whether the U.S. will pay back its debt," Laurence D. Fink, the chief executive of the money manager BlackRock, said Wednesday morning. That means higher borrowing costs in the United States and elsewhere.
While this fiscal impasse may be ending , many on Wall Street fear that Washington is not done.
"Then we can come back some time in December, January and February," said Brian Gardner of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, a New York investment bank, "and do this all over again."

Full text:   Updated, 8:50 p.m. | While investors were cheered on Wednesday by a last-minute agreement to raise the nation's borrowing limit and end the government shutdown, their relief was tempered by the knowledge that the deal was far from a permanent solution. And they were tabulating what the long-term costs of the political turmoil could be.
Under the agreement, the government would be financed through Jan. 15 and the Treasury would have borrowing powers until Feb. 7. At that point, sharp political divisions could re-emerge, and with them, more volatility in the markets.
Many investors were left worrying that the budget crises that have become more frequent in recent years could spin on endlessly, with no long-term resolution.
"I worry if this becomes a regular feature that all we can do is pass these three- or four-month fixes," said Joe Kalish, the chief global macro strategist at Ned Davis Research. "If that's going to be the case, it just puts this uncertainty into the market on a recurring basis."
For one day, at least, investors breathed a little easier. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index ended the day just shy of the nominal record it hit in September (without adjustment for inflation), before the current impasse began. The short-term Treasury bills that were battered over the last two weeks were again popular as investors regained faith that the government would not default on its obligations.
The Congressional battles' direct effect on investors appears to be somewhat limited. The markets never reached the same level of panic that preceded the previous debt ceiling crisis in 2011 and the so-called fiscal cliff in late 2012.
At its low point during the last few weeks, the S.& P. 500 was down 4 percent from its nominal high. On Wednesday, the benchmark index rose 1.4 percent, or 23.48 points, to 1,721.54. During the government shutdown, it actually rose 2.4 percent.
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 1.4 percent, or 205.82 points, to close at 15,373.83 on Wednesday, while the Nasdaq composite index climbed 1.2 percent, or 45.42 points, to 3,839.43.
There has been much more movement in the prices of short-term Treasury bills. Investors worried that the government might delay some payments on its outstanding debt if Congress did not raise the debt ceiling before the Treasury exhausted its emergency borrowing measures.
For a one-month Treasury bill, the yield, which goes up as the debt becomes less popular, rose to a high of 0.35 percent on Tuesday night after negotiations appeared to be falling apart, compared with 0.08 percent just a few weeks ago. On Wednesday, the yield fell in half, to 0.14 percent. A six-month bill due on Oct. 31 followed a similar pattern.
There is some concern that the enthusiasm on Wednesday could go too far, given that much of the damage in the markets in 2011 came after politicians voted to lift the debt ceiling. When Standard & Poor's downgraded the United States credit rating a few days later, stocks plunged.
One of the two other main credit rating agencies, Fitch Ratings, warned on Tuesday that it had a negative outlook on its AAA rating for the United States. That did not seem to weigh on investors on Wednesday -- and Fitch said its review would take months -- but if Fitch ultimately lowered its rating, it could wreak further havoc on Wall Street.
Many investors said that, barring a downgrade, attention in the immediate future would most likely turn back to the strength of the economy and the fate of the bond-buying programs the Federal Reserve has used to stimulate the economy.
The shutdown will most likely exert a direct drag on the economy in the fourth quarter. Several economists predicted that growth in the quarter would be reduced by 0.2 to 0.3 percentage point on an annualized basis.
The bigger damage to the economy may come from consumers and businesses spending less out of fear for the next budget crisis, which would put a cap on how much companies can grow.
"The uncertainty breeds a degree of overly conservative behavior," said Marshall Front, the head of the money manager Front Barnett Associates. "The animal spirits that are necessary to get an above-average expansion in the economy are largely absent."
Of the 10 companies in the S.& P. 500 that have talked about the coming quarter, eight have provided negative guidance, according to Thomson Reuters. Analysts have also been lowering their estimates for fourth-quarter profits over the last few weeks.
That slowdown, though, may make it less likely that the Fed will pull back on its bond purchases, something that could lift stocks.
For Wall Street, the biggest concern coming out of the current battles is that they will force the government to pay more to borrow money in the future. For now, rates are falling. On Wednesday, the yield on the benchmark 10-year bond fell to 2.67 percent, from 2.73 percent late on Tuesday.
The rate investors are demanding on one-month Treasury bills is also down from its high, but it is still far above where it was before the crisis began. IHS Global Insight estimated on Wednesday that just from the Treasury auctions held this week, the government will pay $114 million more in interest than it would have otherwise.
If the government has to pay higher rates in the future, that will probably lead to higher borrowing costs for homes and cars, given that most loan markets use Treasuries as a benchmark.
"It might be a small change, but when you are talking about trillions of dollars of bonds, it adds up," Mr. Front said.
Any long-term turn away from Treasury bonds would most likely be driven in large part by foreign investors, like the Chinese and Japanese governments, which are some of the biggest holders of Treasury debt. The willingness of these governments to buy bonds has long held down the cost of credit in the United States and helped keep the dollar as the world's reserve currency.
There have been signs that the Chinese government may use the crisis to try to attract more investors to its currency, the renminbi. So far, overall holdings of Treasury bonds do not appear to be dropping. But each new crisis gives those big investors another reason to want to leave.
"If this becomes a more regular feature, investors are going to look for some alternative," Mr. Kalish said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text:   THE punishing impact of investment expenses on wealth is like wind, sun and rain pounding on painted wood over time. There is a lot of damage.
Yet the effect of "all-in," or total, investment expenses is not often vigorously debated. Management fees, seemingly innocuous charges and other factors can take their toll, but many of these expenses are hidden.
The body of research on expenses is large and pretty clear-cut: investors can cut portfolio costs and increase returns if they are vigilant in their choices.
William F. Sharpe, who won the Nobel in economic science, published a paper this year in The Financial Analysts Journal that detailed how much investors stand to lose from high expenses. It compared the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund (VTSMX), a broad-based United States stock index fund, with expense ratios of similar actively managed funds. The Vanguard fund charged 0.06 percent annually on $10,000 invested over a decade. The more expensive fund levied a 1.12 percent charge. The less expensive fund netted savings of more than $2,000.
What matters in this example, aside from the large difference in annual costs, is what Mr. Sharpe calls a "terminal wealth ratio," or the amount of money you keep over time after expenses and accounting for inflation when you make the comparison.
"Whether one is investing a lump-sum amount or a series of periodic amounts, the arithmetic of investment expenses is compelling," Mr. Sharpe concludes in the paper.
Wealth erosion is most severe when you subtract less visible costs, like holding onto cash or portfolio turnover.
John C. Bogle, the founder of the Vanguard Group, who has long been an advocate and creator of low-cost expense funds, said Mr. Sharpe's conclusions were valid, but incomplete.
Mr. Bogle (who wrote the foreword to my new book, "Keynes's Way to Wealth") called attention to the fact that the fund expense ratio understates total costs investors pay. In addition to costs included in the expense ratio, investors need to look at transaction fees, sales charges and the "drag" of a fund manager who holds assets in cash, which pays almost nothing these days.
Tallying the total expenses of an actively managed fund and comparing them to a passively managed index fund, Mr. Bogle has found that the lower-cost funds have a 2.25 percent annual cost advantage.
He said in an e-mail that in a stock market with 7 percent annual returns, the returns of a fund with high total expenses would be reduced to 4.75 percent. Over 50 years, "a $10,000 initial investment would grow to $100,000 rather than $290,000," he wrote. "At a cost of 0.06 percent -- easily obtainable in a low-cost all-market index fund -- the return would be 6.94 percent and the final value about $286,000."
Of course, you may be able to find an active manager who beat the market and outperformed an index. In that case, the higher fees the manager charges would be justified.
But as Mr. Bogle and many low-cost advocates argue, how can you find market-beating managers in advance? How will you know when they are going to have a good year? And if they had a good year, was it because of luck or skill? Could they repeat it?
Past returns are not helpful to new investors. And it is brutally difficult to beat the market after taxes, inflation and expenses. It is very rare that any investment manager can justify the fees a fund charges.
Then there is market timing and related expenses. "The real cost," said Rick Ferri, president of Portfolio Solutions in Troy, Mich., is "an investor or managers trying to do timing."
"They tend to get in and out at the wrong time," he said. Mr. Ferri estimates that investors lose at least 1 percent a year because of mistiming of the market. As a result, he is critical of management fees and calls them the "last bastion of gluttony."
Fortunately, most of these expense-intensive mistakes are avoidable and lead to a few solid conclusions: the lowest-cost, diversified passive portfolio has the least all-in expenses.
Typically, this means that a portfolio of low-cost exchange-traded and mutual funds can best serve the goal of cost-saving. Even more savings can be achieved by going the do-it-yourself route, by either constructing a portfolio or mimicking a portfolio provided by online services.
In addition to Vanguard, the Dimensional Fund Advisers, Fidelity, iShares, Schwab and State Street (SPDR) groups offer low-cost passively managed funds. You can also try online portfolio sites like Betterment.com and Flatfeeportfolios.com.
Vet the expenses reported in your 401(k) disclosure statements and compare them to similar passive funds. If working with an adviser, who may charge 1 percent or more annually on assets under management, compare the adviser's total charges with a portfolio you can create with retail mutual- or exchange-traded funds.
At the very least, you should know how much you are paying in all-in expenses and buy lower-cost alternatives.
Also look at internal portfolio transaction expenses, which are usually found in a fund's "statement of additional information," which most investors never read. And be aware of how "loads," or sales charges, might affect total return. Investors are nearly always better off finding "no-load" funds and avoiding brokers.
If you go it alone, also keep in mind that you still need to have some idea of the risk profile of the portfolio you choose. What is the downside or standard deviation, which measures volatility compared to a market average? Expenses are still important, but the bottom line remains how much you can lose during a market downturn.

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDEDRemember the last time the country came to the brink of default? It was August 2011. For the first time in history, Standard & Poor's, the ratings agency, downgraded United States government debt.
"The effectiveness, stability, and predictability of American policy making and political institutions have weakened at a time of ongoing fiscal and economic challenges," it said. Investors around the world rushed to find a safe place to put their money.
Rather than dump America's downgraded bonds, however, investors flocked to them. The dollar strengthened. The United States might have become a threat to the world economy, but with even worse troubles developing elsewhere, including a flare-up in the euro crisis, it was still its safest place.
As George Soros, the hedge fund investor, told me in an interview last Friday, "The dollar is the weakest currency except for all the others."
The dollar's resilience comes to mind as Congress again flirts with financial disaster.
As time ticked down to a possible government default as early as Thursday, Republicans in the House failed once again on Tuesday to agree on a proposal to relieve the impasse, reopen the government and lift the debt ceiling.
"How can the United States preserve its financial and security leadership role when it conducts itself with such ineptitude and such disregard for the consequences for the world?" asked Charles Dallara, a senior Treasury official for the former presidents Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush who until earlier this year headed the Institute of International Finance, a lobby group of international banks.
Hosting finance ministers from around the world last week at the International Monetary Fund's fall meeting in Washington, Christine Lagarde, the fund's managing director, told NBC's "Meet the Press" that failing to lift the debt ceiling would cause so much disruption to the world economy that "the standing of the U.S. economy would, again, be at risk."
Indeed, the United States' erratic policy making has kindled fears that the dollar could lose its perch as the world's reserve currency -- what the former French president Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, while de Gaulle's finance minister, once called America's "exorbitant privilege."
Today almost two-thirds of the world's foreign currency reserves are held in dollar assets, mostly Treasury bonds. Nearly half the foreign debt securities in the world are in dollars, as are more than half the world's cross-border loans and deposits.
It made sense for other countries to embrace the dollar in an earlier era, when the United States was willing to act as guarantor of global stability. But today, with Republicans in Congress wielding default as a lever in a vain attempt to kill Obamacare, perhaps it is no surprise that the rest of the world is getting more serious about finding an alternative.
"It is perhaps a good time for the befuddled world to start considering building a de-Americanized world," said a statement on Monday by Xinhua, the state news agency of China -- which holds some $1.3 trillion in Treasury bonds.
The prospect is sending shivers down Americans' spines. Robert J. Barbera, the co-director of the Center for Financial Economics at Johns Hopkins University, told my colleague Floyd Norris that allowing the dollar to lose its status as the world's premier reserve asset "would be the single greatest mistake in American economic history."
Yet for all the dysfunction on display in Washington, the hand-wringing is overwrought. Several things must be kept in mind: first, it is inevitable that the dollar will gradually lose its position as the world's monopoly reserve currency. In some ways, it already has.
Second, barring a true act of default -- a veritable catastrophe that Mr. Soros told me on Friday "everybody knows won't happen" -- it has no chance of losing its reserve currency status anytime soon.
Third, the dollar's losing reserve status might not be such a bad thing, either for the United States or the world.
Today the dollar is hobbled not only by Washington's appetite for self-destruction.
The job of reserve currency is too big for the dollar to shoulder alone. Under the current system, every time some country on the other side of the world wants to add one dollar to its reserves, the United States government must issue one additional dollar worth of debt.
As a recent report about how to reform the world monetary system pointed out, the balance sheet of the United States government is not big enough to accommodate the reserves demanded by the rest of the world. Other currencies -- most likely the euro and the Chinese renminbi -- must eventually provide feasible alternatives.
"The United States will inevitably lose its reserve currency monopoly," wrote its authors, the economists Hélène Rey of the London Business School, Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas of the University of California, Berkeley, and Emmanuel Farhi of Harvard University. "It can only be a matter of time before the world becomes multipolar."
Officialdom is thinking about this, too. In the spring of 2010, months before the midterm elections put the Tea Party into the national spotlight, the International Monetary Fund issued a document that noted how "reserves concentration in the government debt of one country introduces idiosyncratic risks to the international monetary system."
It meant, of course, the United States. Inflation could erode the value of dollar assets, loose monetary policy by the Federal Reserve could inflate bubbles abroad, American budget deficits could push up interest rates everywhere. And, unthinkable as it was then, the American government might default. The I.M.F. suggested it might be "worth exploring whether different arrangements could underpin a more robust system for the long term."
A multipolar world might be a riskier one than the one we know. If countries and investors viewed the dollar, the euro and the renminbi as substitutes, an economic wobble in any of the three currency areas could set off a giant switch of reserves to the others -- sending shock waves through the financial system.
Barry Eichengreen of the University of California, Berkeley, estimates that losing the dollar's position as the leading international currency would cost the United States some 2 percent of its gross domestic product, about a year's worth of growth.
But multipolarity also presents advantages.
For starters, the world's store of safe, liquid assets would expand to include Chinese and European bonds, allowing central banks around the world to build reserve cushions without creating the kind of large imbalances spawned by the mass accumulation of dollars by China, Japan and others, which fed large trade deficits and a huge financial bubble in the United States. For another, a cheaper dollar would enhance the ability of United States companies to sell their goods abroad.
"The dollar's international role represents the ultimate moral hazard," C. Fred Bergsten, who runs the Peterson Institute for International Economics, told me.
"It allows us to finance our external imbalances and through that our internal imbalances to an important extent. It removes the market pressure that forces politicians to get serious about reducing internal imbalances."
Whatever the merits of diminishing the role of the dollar, though, nobody should expect any of this to happen soon. The euro is hobbled by Europe's inability to overcome its economic disparities. China's capital account is still tightly controlled by the government.
On Tuesday, Britain became the first country to sign an agreement with China allowing investors in London to get a license that will allow them to invest directly in shares and bonds in renminbi. It's a long way from there to the kind of open capital market China would need for its currency to become a reserve asset.
And there's inertia. "Once you have reserve currency status you are embedded in a lot of contracts all over the world," said Lord Adair Turner, former chairman of Britain's Financial Services Authority. "It is very difficult for this suddenly to flip."
Britain's experience might serve as precedent. The world's foremost power during much of the 1800s, Britain saw its influence peak by 1870. By the turn of the century, it had largely lost its capacity to enforce Pax Britannica.
Still, it took 10 years after the end of World War II and a 30 percent devaluation of the pound before the share of dollar reserves in the world exceeded that of sterling.
The United States appears to be in the middle of a similar process. "During the cold war there was strong bipartisan consensus that United States leadership in the world was a good thing for us and a good thing for the rest of the world," said Jeffrey Frankel, an economic adviser for President Clinton, now at Harvard's Kennedy School. "In the last 10 years we completely blew it."
Tea Party adherents in Congress are doing their best to erode that leadership. But to really tip the dollar off its perch, they will have to keep at it for 15 or 20 more years.
Correction: October 18, 2013, Friday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The Economic Scene column on Wednesday, about the fiscal impasse's threat to diminish the United States dollar's role as a world reserve currency, misidentified a former French official who referred to that role as America's "exorbitant privilege." It was Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, while finance minister under President Charles de Gaulle, not de Gaulle himself. The column also misstated the academic affiliation of Hélène Rey, a co-author of a paper on the international monetary system. She is at the London Business School, not the London School of Economics. And the column referred incorrectly to an era of British primacy. Britain was the world's foremost power during much of the 1800s, not the 1900s.

Full text:   FOR most Americans, the economy over the last 10 years has felt like a slog interrupted by a punch: the recession came amid years of stagnation. But for America's top earners, the experience has been more like whiplash: a boom followed by a bust followed by a boom.
Call it the 1 percent boomerang. The country's top earners lost huge sums during the recession, as housing values plummeted and the stock market crashed. But the recovery has restored those fortunes -- and then some, for some people -- and created tremendous new ones.
The trend starts with the merely quite well-off, households earning more than about $150,000 a year. And the sums become more exaggerated higher up the income scale.
Take the average earnings of those in the top 0.01 percent: They plummeted from $30.67 million in 2007 to $18.24 million in 2009, before soaring to $27 million last year, according to Emmanuel Saez of the University of California, Berkeley, a researcher of American inequality and earnings. For the median-income household, income has slid from $55,627 to $53,285 to $51,017 at the same intervals. The number of American billionaires has whipsawed too, from 469 in 2008, to 359 during the crisis, and back up to 442 this year.
"If you didn't lose any money during the recession, it's because you did not have any money to begin with," said Milton Pedraza of the Luxury Institute, a boutique consultancy. "It's been a real bonanza since the end of 2009."
That bonanza is evident in luxury sales, in the market for homes in places like Kiawah Island, S.C., and Martha's Vineyard, Mass., in bookings for private jets and in the return of nine-figure philanthropy. Chains like Burberry and Prada are expanding in the United States again. Sales of million-dollar homes shot up 37 percent from the first half of 2012 to the first half of 2013. And the growth in luxury-car sales is about twice as fast as it is for the more pedestrian Fords, Mazdas and Jeeps.
The sums sloshing around are in some cases as big as before the recession, analysts said, but the conspicuous consumption has died down. "People are not buying the red sports car or the orange sports car," Mr. Pedraza said. "You'll get a blue one instead." He also noted that "as the wealthy get older, they're less interested in things and more interested in experiences," shifting spending into vacations and dining and away from yachts and jets.
Socially minded philanthropy has also become more prevalent since the recession, analysts said, as charitable giving, dominated by wealthier families in good times and bad, rises to close to its 2007 highs.
"These are 60-year-old men," said David Friedman, the president of Wealth-X, a firm that researches ultra-high-net-worth individuals. "They realize they're not immortal. And when they start to sense that mortality, they're going to be fueling luxury consumption and fueling philanthropy in a way the market's never seen."
Of course, the 1 percent or top 0.1 percent is not a static figure. Every year, millions of individuals and households move up or down the income scale depending on their earnings, investments and age. Fortunes wax and wane as new tech gurus graduate from college and top lawyers head into retirement.
Still, economists said that people holding considerable capital -- de facto, the already rich -- have done well during the recovery. Moreover, the 1 percent tends to be sticky, and perhaps even more so in bad times than in good times, Mr. Saez said. One study by the Treasury economists Gerald Auten, Geoffrey Gee and Nicholas Turner found that a quarter to a third of 1 percenters in a given year stayed in the 1 percent for all of the following five. . Thus, the profile of wealth in the United States, before the recession and after, has remained much the same.
The prototypical high-net-worth individual is coastal, educated, older, white and male, Mr. Friedman said. The investor and chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway, Warren E. Buffett, might not be coastal, but the other categories apply, and with cash on hand and an appetite for acquisitions during the recovery, his net worth has increased by about $10 billion over the last year.
Technology has minted hundreds of new top earners too, also generally men, but often much younger. David Duffield of Workday and Elon Musk of Tesla, among others, have benefited from the tech boom. Still, fields like finance, medicine and energy continue to be top moneymakers, with financiers and owners of their own or family businesses dominating the ultra-high-net-worth category.
Three big interconnected economic phenomena have driven the boomerang among the country's top earners, economists said: stocks, houses and loans. The rich took huge losses when the markets plummeted in 2008 and 2009. But those who held on or bought in after then have been richly rewarded, as every dollar invested in the Dow Jones in 2009 is worth about $1.40 now, after correcting for inflation.
The gains in the markets have bolstered the earnings and the net worth of the half of Americans who own stocks, including through vehicles like mutual funds. But the wealthy have benefited disproportionately. According to Edward Wolff, a New York University economist, the richest 10 percent of households own more than 80 percent of stocks, as measured by value, held directly or through vehicles like mutual funds. And on top of earnings from cashing out, shareholders have also benefited from surging dividends. Last year, many companies gave rich dividends -- about $260 billion worth -- before taxes on unearned income increased in January.
A second factor is housing. Wealthier Americans tend to have a smaller proportion of their net worth tied up in their homes; thus the nationwide collapse in prices did not hit them as hard. But after prices dropped and credit markets loosened, many of them were able to buy homes as investments.
"The combination of low mortgage rates and prices coming off the bottom meant that if you could buy a house, or multiple houses, you could have jumped into the market and then seen appreciation of a handful of markets up to 30 percent in a year," said Jed Kolko, the chief economist at Trulia, the real estate Web site.
Finally, higher-income Americans have been able to take advantage of the low cost of capital created by the Fed soaking up hundreds of billions of dollars of assets, by refinancing their homes, buying rental properties or expanding family businesses. Tight credit conditions have left out millions of lower-income Americans.
But looking closely at those drivers of earnings and wealth, economists say the years ahead may in some ways be rockier than the years just passed.
The Federal Reserve has started looking at ways to end its extraordinary support for the weak economy, meaning borrowing costs might start to creep up. Housing prices have risen in popular investment markets like Las Vegas and Detroit, meaning thinner profits. Of course, that hardly means that another bust waits around the corner for the boomerangers.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Be skeptical. Be very, very skeptical.
That was the reaction from nearly all corners to the talk of convening yet another round of bipartisan negotiations to reduce the nation's long-term debt. The idea has resurfaced as a way of resolving the standoff between President Obama and the Republican-controlled House over reopening the government and increasing its legal borrowing limit, perhaps for months or even just weeks.
But even if the current talks soon resolve the immediate impasse, which did not look likely on Saturday, any renewal of negotiations for a long-term fiscal plan will run into the same underlying problem that has doomed efforts for the past three years.
Republicans refuse to raise additional tax revenue, and until they do, Mr. Obama will not support even his own tentative proposals for reducing spending on fast-growing social benefit programs, chiefly Medicare. During a White House meeting with Senate Republicans on Friday, he reiterated that the two go hand in hand, according to people who were there.
"Revenue remains obviously the biggest stumbling block," said Ed Lorenzen, the executive director of the Moment of Truth Project, a fiscal advocacy group formed by the chairmen of Mr. Obama's failed 2010 fiscal commission, Erskine B. Bowles, a former chief of staff for President Bill Clinton, and Alan K. Simpson, a former Senate Republican leader from Wyoming.
Brian Gardner, a senior vice president in Washington of the investment firm Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, said: "We've been through this fight before. I'm very skeptical on the grand bargain."
Yet Speaker John A. Boehner, who only a week ago again ruled out raising taxes, is demanding as part of a short-term deal that he and Mr. Obama return to the bargaining table for a deficit-reduction blueprint covering many years and ultimately saving trillions of dollars.
While that prospect has cheered budget watchers in both parties, even they know the discouraging history of such negotiations. In the three years since Republicans won control of the House, there have been five bipartisan efforts to design a long-term debt-reduction plan, two of them between Mr. Obama and Mr. Boehner. All collapsed.
The most recent effort, between the White House and some Republican senators, died this summer.
Yet there is some broad common ground, which is why the idea of talks keeps surfacing. Both sides recognize that the United States must confront the rising costs of the benefit programs, especially Medicare and Medicaid but also Social Security. Those are driving projections that the mounting debt will become unsustainable after 2016, as more baby boomers begin drawing on benefits and health care costs rise.
Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the chairman of the House Budget Committee and the conservative Republicans' fiscal guru, has retreated -- for now -- from insisting that Medicare be transformed into a voucherlike program and Medicaid into a much-reduced state block grant.
In a recent shift, he has proposed embracing several of Mr. Obama's plans that would trim Medicare and Medicaid expenses by $400 billion over the first 10 years while otherwise leaving the programs unchanged. The savings would come in part by means-testing Medicare so that more affluent beneficiaries pay more for coverage and by ensuring that taxpayers are not subsidizing so-called Medigap policies that upper-income recipients buy for extra coverage.
Significantly, Mr. Ryan has been silent recently on the president's health care law -- a break from conservatives' unattainable demands to defund, delay or even repeal the Affordable Care Act, and the major issue that led to the Republicans' refusal to finance the government.
He has also noted that both sides want to overhaul the tax code, simplifying it by reducing tax breaks for corporations and individuals. The difference is that Republicans want to use new revenue from scouring the code to reduce Americans' tax rates. Mr. Obama and Democrats say some of that revenue must be used to pay down the debt.
"This isn't a grand bargain," Mr. Ryan wrote in The Wall Street Journal last week, acknowledging his more modest proposals. "For that we need a complete rethinking of the government's approach to health care. But right now we need to find common ground."
That suggests a less ambitious outcome for any deficit-reduction talks that would spring from the current impasse. In the past, the general goal was $4 trillion in savings in 10 years that would compound over time.
Democrats and many Republicans also want to apply some new savings not to reduce the deficit, but to replace roughly $100 billion a year in across-the-board cuts known as sequestration, which since March have been hitting nearly all federal programs, domestic and military. Those cuts do not touch the benefit programs that are the root of the long-term debt problem.
While Republicans initiated the call for renewed negotiations, party lawmakers and senior aides said in interviews that they could not say exactly what Mr. Boehner would take to the table. Some pointed to Mr. Ryan's recent suggestions. By contrast, Mr. Obama's plan is well known: over some Democrats' objections, he put it in his annual budget in April, hoping his concessions would entice Republicans to parlay.
The president proposed $1.8 trillion in deficit reductions over the next 10 years, including the $400 billion in Medicare and Medicaid savings. He also called for saving $230 billion by changing an inflation measure, the Consumer Price Index, which would have the effect of lowering the government's annual benefit adjustments, including for Social Security, and raising revenue as some taxpayers more quickly reach higher tax brackets.
An additional $200 billion would come from other domestic and military programs; $200 billion more from accounts covering farm subsidies, federal employee retirement programs, the Postal Service and the unemployment compensation system; and still another $200 billion, he estimated, from lower interest payments on the reduced federal debt.
But Mr. Obama called for $580 billion in new tax revenue over 10 years by closing loopholes and offering tax breaks. And he wants any budget deal to provide more spending, not less, for investments in infrastructure, technology and research, and for universal prekindergarten programs. That would be a hard sell, but still far from the biggest impediment to a bipartisan deal.
"If you talk about reforming entitlements and adding revenues, boy, then both sides just go ballistic," said Senator Saxby Chambliss, Republican of Georgia. "And right now the tension is so high, it's just not the right time for it." Mr. Chambliss knows the difficulties -- he is not seeking re-election partly because of his frustrations after more than two years of seeking a grand bargain as part of a bipartisan group of senators known as the Gang of Eight.
Even the prospective bargainers are skeptical.
In January, with the start of a new Congress and Mr. Obama's second term, Mr. Boehner declared that he would never again negotiate with the president, calling it "futile."
So when Mr. Boehner last week raised the idea of a third round of talks during an Oval Office meeting of the president, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Congressional leaders, Democrats rolled their eyes and laughed, according to people who were there.
"On the one hand, the speaker says he wants to have an open negotiation; on the other hand, he is shutting the door to eliminating a single tax break for the purpose of reducing the deficit," said Representative Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland.
On the Republican side, a senior Congressional aide who declined to be identified while the parties were trying to break the impasse, said flatly: "We're never going to have a grand bargain with this president, I think that is safe to say. Ever."

Full text:   LONDON -- Britain's central bank decided on Thursday to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged at a record low in the face of more evidence that the country's economic recovery was gaining speed.
The Bank of England voted, as expected, to leave its interest rate at 0.5 percent and to hold its program of economic stimulus at 375 billion pounds, or nearly $600 billion.
Britain's economic recovery has been gaining momentum as consumer confidence returns and disposable incomes have improve over recent months. A surprise drop in industrial production in August signaled on Wednesday, however, that some headwinds to the recovery persist.
Recent positive economic data raised some questions about whether Mark J. Carney, who took over as Bank of England governor in July, would stick to the plan he announced in August. To eliminate uncertainty among households and investors when interest rates would rise again, Mr. Carney said then that the rates would remain unchanged at least until unemployment declined to 7 percent, from the current 7.7 percent. Some investors said the positive data put pressure on Mr. Carney to raise interest rates earlier, but Mr. Carney has resisted.
Policy makers have said unemployment was unlikely to drop to 7 percent before the end of 2016, but some investors said the central bank might be forced to abandon the plan because of higher inflation. Economists at Nomura and Deutsche Bank were among those who predicted higher interest rates for 2015. The benchmark rate has been at 0.5 percent since March 2009. Economists don't anticipate a change in the bank's bond-buying stimulus program unless the economic recovery stalls.
With monetary policy on hold, some economists said that Mr. Carney's focus is shifting to his responsibility for maintaining stability in Britain's financial system. At the top of his list are possible responses to the debt ceiling and budget deadlock in the United States and Britain's Help to Buy plan, a government program to make mortgages more affordable.
"Short of external shocks, which might include the U.S. debt ceiling, there's not much that can shift monetary policy at the moment," David Tinsley, an economist at BNP Paribas in London, said. "The only thing that's a nagging thorn in the side is the housing market."
Some of Britain's largest banks have started offering residential mortgages this week for houses worth up to £600,000, or $965,000, with a deposit of as little as 5 percent. Under this part of the Help to Buy program, which was brought forward by three months by David Cameron's government, the government is guaranteeing the banks as much as 15 percent of the value of the home in exchange for a fee.
The program has raised concerns among some policy makers, economists and real estate market analysts, who argued that the program threatens to create a housing bubble by inflating house prices and making them less instead of more affordable in the long term. An index tracking house prices already rose to the highest level in more than a decade in September, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said.
Critics also warned that the program, which some said was political maneuvering ahead of a 2015 general election, would shift lending risk from banks to the government.
Mr. Carney has been deflecting such criticism for now, saying he and the Bank of England were keeping a close eye on Britain's housing market.
The European Central Bank decided last week to leave its benchmark interest rate unchanged at a record low of 0.5 percent. Mario Draghi, the head of the central bank, indicated that he was ready to take steps to protect the euro zone from political turmoil in the United States.

Full text:   President Obama was wise to nominate Janet Yellen, vice chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, to be the Fed's next leader. As a deeply respected economist, she will bring two vital attributes to that role as a steward of the economy.
First, she represents continuity with the Fed's current low-interest-rate policies to foster employment while controlling inflation. Those policies, which she has helped to create and sustain, have undeniably boosted the flagging economy.
Just as undeniably, they have generated controversy and consternation. Ms. Yellen has expertly addressed those concerns, including the risks inherent in a prolonged low-interest-rate policy, though the most feared effect, inflation, is as yet nowhere in sight.
She also has been realistic about the limits of the Fed's efforts. Her grasp of the issues in all their complexity has given her the credibility to lead the Fed in deciding how long to continue monetary stimulus policies and how eventually to ease up and end them.
Second, she also represents a break from Mr. Obama's circle of policy makers whose reputations were marred by their roles before or during the financial crisis. Her nomination comes after Lawrence Summers, an architect of Clinton-era policies to deregulate derivatives and an Obama adviser who underestimated the need for stimulus, withdrew his name from consideration. By choosing someone outside his usual circle, Mr. Obama sends a strong signal of moving forward.
In accepting the nomination, Ms. Yellen said that expertise, objectivity, debate and consensus are crucial to effective Fed policy-making. She is widely admired for all of these traits. Labels like dove versus hawk on monetary policy really do not apply to her.
Rather, her responses to economic problems have invariably been data driven, grounded in facts and analysis and subject to change as the facts change. For example, as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco from 2004 to 2010, she sounded the warning about housing bubbles, even as others praised the boom.
That display of sound judgment is not unusual in her record. In a tally by The Wall Street Journal of economic predictions on growth, inflation and unemployment made by 14 Fed members between 2009 and 2012, Ms. Yellen ranked at the top.
The Senate should move quickly to confirm Ms. Yellen. As leader of the world's most powerful central bank, the Fed chief is also the most important international economic policy maker. Congress's current fiscal recklessness is roiling international markets. Confirming Ms. Yellen promptly would help to quell that instability.
Her nomination is a bright spot in a week dominated by the threat of a default from failure to raise debt ceiling. The Fed would be in good hands under her leadership.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- President Obama on Wednesday announced what he called perhaps his most important economic decision, nominating Janet L. Yellen to lead the Federal Reserve system and be his independent co-steward of the economy, calling her "one of the nation's foremost economists and policy makers."
Ms. Yellen, 67, would be elevated from the Fed's vice chairwoman to become the first woman to lead the 100-year-old central bank. The Senate is generally expected to confirm her nomination for the four-year term.
For the announcement, she joined Mr. Obama in the State Dining Room of the White House, along with the retiring chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, whom the president hailed for helping guide the economy through the worst financial crisis since the Depression.
The president said Ms. Yellen was "renowned for her good judgment," and he credited her with sounding early alarms about the financial and housing bubbles that caused the economy's near-collapse in 2008.
"Given the urgent economic challenges facing our nation, I urge the Senate to confirm Janet without delay," Mr. Obama said. "I'm absolutely confident that she will be an exceptional chair of the Federal Reserve."
In a brief response, she said: "While I think we all agree, Mr. President, that more needs to be done to strengthen the recovery, particularly for those hardest hit by the Great Recession, we have made progress. The economy is stronger and the financial system sounder." Her comments are likely to be parsed by lawmakers and markets looking for signs of whether Ms. Yellen will continue the Fed's stimulative monetary policies.
Her nomination comes amid the rancorous partisan battle over the economy. The government has been partly shut down since Oct. 1, and next week the Treasury Department will hit the limit of its authority to borrow to pay the nation's bills. That is forcing emergency actions and contingency plans that could be financially destabilizing at best and provoke a global crisis at worst.
Ms. Yellen's nomination hearings will add another wild card to a complicated mix of year-end legislative business. Mr. Bernanke's term ends Jan. 31.
A few Senate Republicans, like Bob Corker of Tennessee, have spoken out against Ms. Yellen as too dovish on monetary policy; he and others made the same complaints in 2010 when the president named her as vice chairwoman. But no Senate Republicans have signaled any intention to try to block her appointment, said a leadership aide.
That suggests that Ms. Yellen could be confirmed with a majority vote, not a 60-vote supermajority, in a Senate where Democrats have 52 members and often count on support from the two independent senators. Ms. Yellen has nearly unanimous support among Democratic senators.
By contrast, had Mr. Obama nominated his first choice for Fed chief, Lawrence H. Summers, his former economic adviser, he would have alienated many Congressional Democrats when he needs a united party as he confronts the Republican-controlled House of Representatives over government financing and the debt ceiling. And it would have assured a confirmation fight when markets crave greater certainty in monetary policy.
Ms. Yellen would be the first Democrat to be Fed chief in a quarter-century -- President Bill Clinton and Mr. Obama previously named two Republicans, Alan Greenspan and Mr. Bernanke, to second terms. Progressive senators and outside groups had pressed for Ms. Yellen's nomination rather than Mr. Summers's, viewing her as more inclined to regulate big banks and more likely to stress the job-creation aspect of the Fed's dual mandate to fight unemployment and inflation.
Senator Michael D. Crapo of Idaho, the senior Republican on the Senate Banking Committee, which must clear the nomination before it moves to the full Senate, took a neutral tone in a statement reacting to the announcement.
"The next Fed chair faces a unique set of challenges," he said, "including winding down unconventional monetary policy."
He also said the Fed must carry out a long list of tightened financial regulations without "over-regulating the community banking sector" and effectively communicate policies to the markets and the public.
"I continue to strongly disagree with the Fed's use of quantitative easing," Mr. Crapo said, "and am eager to learn Ms. Yellen's vision for the direction of the Federal Reserve as we go through the nomination process."
The president's decision came weeks later than the markets and even some in the administration had hoped, delayed by Democratic infighting.
Financial markets have been anxious over who would take over from Mr. Bernanke and wind down the expansionary monetary policy that he engineered to help the recovering economy. The Bernanke-led Fed has maintained those policies partly to offset the fact that the White House and Congress were providing no fiscal stimulus, and instead have pursued contractionary spending cuts since Republicans took over the House.
Generally, market analysts favored Ms. Yellen's selection, seeing her as a welcome continuity after Mr. Bernanke, and more likely, perhaps, than Mr. Summers to continue the monetary expansion a bit longer.

Abstract: Michael Feroli, chief United States economist for JPMorgan Chase, wrote in a note to clients that he did not expect Ms. Yellen's nomination to affect the trajectory of the Fed's decision making, because her views already are represented in that process and because Fed officials seem determined to retreat as soon as it can be justified.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The decision by Federal Reserve officials last month to continue the stimulus campaign came down to this: their anxiety that the economy might falter outweighed their anxiety that waiting to pull back would surprise and confuse investors.
The mounting fiscal crisis in Washington suggests that some months will pass before the Fed will have cause to reconsider.
The Fed came close to sounding a retreat in September, according to an official account of its meeting published Wednesday.
Officials were united that the bond-buying campaign begun last year had produced the desired improvement in job growth. Most officials also agreed that the Fed should start pulling back by the end of 2013.
But during an unusually fractious meeting, some officials worried that the gains might not be sustainable and argued that it was "prudent" to postpone retreat, according to the account. A number of officials, "pointed to heightened uncertainty about the course of federal fiscal policy over coming months, including the potential for a government shutdown or strains related to the debt ceiling debate," the account said.
Any differences were papered over in a 9-to-1 vote to keep adding $85 billion a month to the Fed's holdings of Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities, with the goal of reducing borrowing costs for businesses and consumers.
Three weeks later, it seems even less likely that the Fed is on the verge of retreat. The government has shut down partly, depriving the Fed of fresh economic data, among other consequences, and the fight over the debt ceiling is intensifying.
The Fed's leadership also is in transition. President Obama announced the nomination Wednesday of Janet L. Yellen, the Fed's vice chairwoman and a leading proponent of the stimulus, to succeed Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman, when he departs in January.
Ms. Yellen on Wednesday made clear her commitment to the stimulus campaign. "Too many Americans still can't find a job, and worry how they'll pay their bills," she said. "The Federal Reserve can help."
Vincent R. Reinhart, chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley, wrote that the outcome of the September meeting already reflected Ms. Yellen's growing influence and focus on reducing unemployment, as well as Mr. Bernanke's impending departure.
"Bernanke had already left the building," he wrote, "in spirit if not in body."
The diversity of perspectives in the account of the September meeting, and in recent speeches by Fed officials, has produced a wide range of predictions from analysts about the most likely timing for the Fed to begin its retreat, from December to spring 2014.
Michael Feroli, chief United States economist for JPMorgan Chase, wrote in a note to clients that he did not expect Ms. Yellen's nomination to affect the trajectory of the Fed's decision making, because her views already are represented in that process and because Fed officials seem determined to retreat as soon as it can be justified.
He dismissed theories that Mr. Bernanke wants the retreat to begin before he leaves, or that Ms. Yellen would prefer to begin it on her watch to demonstrate her commitment to controlling inflation.
"The current fiscal morass was already increasing the odds that the decision is made sometime in early 2014," Mr. Feroli wrote. "Getting the macro right is hard enough without all these second-order considerations. If payrolls are humming along by then, the decision would likely be made in January, if not, then it would come later."
Other uncertainties were manifest at the meeting. The committee debated but did not resolve whether to retreat by reducing only purchases of Treasuries -- which may be less effective in stimulating the economy -- or also of mortgage bonds.
Officials also considered whether to strengthen the Fed's declaration of intent to hold down short-term interest rates.
The Fed said last December that it planned to keep rates near zero at least as long as the unemployment rate remained above 6.5 percent, provided that inflation did not climb too high. Mr. Bernanke and other officials have emphasized in recent months that rates could stay low well after that threshold is crossed.
At the September meeting, Fed officials discussed bolstering that statement. They considered adding that the central bank would keep rates near zero as long as inflation remained below an acceptable threshold, or providing additional information about the likely path of short-term rates after unemployment falls below 6.5 percent.
For the first time, Fed officials also acknowledged that the leadership transition was complicating these decisions because investors may doubt the Fed's declarations will hold in coming years. As many as four of the seven members of the Fed's board, and two presidents of regional reserve banks, may be replaced in the next year.

Full text:   There are no fast rules for running the Federal Reserve, but Janet L. Yellen has a few.
Rule No. 1: Be methodical and transparent.
Rule No. 2: See rule No. 1.
Even before President Obama nominated her to lead the Fed on Wednesday, Ms. Yellen advocated a rigorous, predictable approach to steering the nation's economy. In speeches in 2012, for instance, she talked about the virtues of using a mathematical formula to help determine when the central bank should raise or lower interest rates. Plug in economic growth, inflation and the like -- and you have a decent guidepost for what policy should look like.
At least in theory. In practice, setting monetary policy rarely comes down to one equation. And not even Ms. Yellen is advocating a policy-by-the-numbers approach just now, given the fragile state of the economy.
But in public speeches and academic work, she has suggested that the Fed should be more systematic, predictable and transparent -- in short, that it should lay down some rules and stick to them. It is a template that Wall Street likes, and one that underscores the Fed's departure from the days of Alan Greenspan, its chairman from 1987 to 2006, whose Delphic pronouncements were endlessly parsed by economists and investors.
Investors hope that a Yellen Fed will clearly telegraph its intentions to the financial markets, particularly as the central bank begins to taper its efforts to kindle growth. On Wednesday, that view was reflected in the stock market, which rebounded after two straight days of losses, in part on hopes that Ms. Yellen, if confirmed, would not rush to withdraw stimulus. The dollar also strengthened.
On Wall Street and in Washington, the view is that Ms. Yellen will generally maintain the policies of the current chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, while pressing for even greater transparency. In interviews, people who have known Ms. Yellen and her work frequently use the same word to describe her: "methodical."
"She thought of things through models that were very methodical and transparent," said someone who worked alongside her when she was at the president's Council of Economic Advisers from 1997 to 1999. "It wasn't like Alan Greenspan where you can't quite follow what he's saying, whether he has a superior model or is just confused. With Janet you could follow every step" and imagine all the assumptions and models she was working from in her head.
Even those who disagree with what the Fed has done under Mr. Bernanke praise Ms. Yellen, currently its vice chairwoman, for her stated commitment to having stricter, clearer guidelines.
"Janet is more interested and concerned with policy being more predictable, rules-based, that markets have some sense of where policy is headed over a long period of time, that you're transparent about your future behavior and you can actually stick to it," said John B. Taylor, an economics professor at Stanford who said the Fed's policy had been too accommodative.
"Bernanke is more ad hoc than Yellen, I'd say, more about putting rules on hold," Mr. Taylor said. He also said that Ms. Yellen appeared to focus more on a rules-based, less "discretionary" approach than Lawrence H. Summers, who was said to be Mr. Obama's first choice for before he withdrew in September.
Mr. Taylor is best known for "the Taylor rule," essentially a mathematical equation that guides how the central bank should set interest rates in response to changes in inflation, output and other economic measures. Ms. Yellen, in speeches in April 2012 and November 2012, spoke about variants on this rule, and the usefulness of such "simple rules" for guiding policy, though in the November speech she said she was not ready to enact such a rule now because these are not "normal times."
Despite Ms. Yellen's reluctance to follow strict rules in setting policy immediately, Mr. Taylor still is heartened by her stated desire to return to them eventually, and the specificity with which she has laid out what her preferred "rule" would look like.
"In that speech, she put on paper what she's talking about, what the rules are," said Mr. Taylor, who devotes a graduate course lecture to weighing his preferred interest-rate-setting rule against a variant Ms. Yellen has described. "Now people can understand them and have the opportunity to discuss the pros and cons. Without that framework, you're just talking about things in the abstract."
He said that the lack of rules-based policy has caused chaos and volatility in the markets -- particularly when it comes to scaling back its ongoing major asset purchases, known as quantitative easing (also called, in its latest incarnation, QE3).
"You can see it with this taper/no taper," he said. "September last year, they started QE3. Then in December they doubled it. Five months later they said they'd start the taper soon, then they have reversed themselves again. You can see it in the markets. Nobody knows what is actually going on."
Ms. Yellen voted alongside Mr. Bernanke and a majority of the Federal Open Market Committee for the actions related to starting, increasing and continuing quantitative easing. But Mr. Taylor still believes that a Fed under her leadership would shift back to more "normal" rules-based policy than it is inclined to do now.
Ms. Yellen's more deliberate approach to tackling economic questions may be a reason that her years at the Fed have been characterized as more successful than those at the Council of Economic Advisers.
Peter R. Orszag, then a special assistant to the president for economic policy and later Mr. Obama's budget director, said in a recent interview that Ms. Yellen did well at both the council and at the Fed. But he also said, "I could see why people believe she's particularly good at situations in which there are important decisions to be made that involve pulling facts and weighing consequences carefully without pulling the trigger right away."
Another former colleague made a similar observation in an interview about how her temperament and approach to policy making might be better suited to work at the Fed than at the White House. "The Fed meets every six weeks and makes usually one big decision after careful forethought and research," the colleague said. "The White House meets every day and has 18 million things to deal with."

Full text:   BERKELEY, Calif. -- When the economists Janet L. Yellen and George A. Akerlof hired a baby sitter for their son in the early 1980s, they decided to pay more than the going wage. They reasoned that a happier baby sitter would provide better care.
The decision not only attracted a series of excellent sitters, it also inspired the couple, both professors at the University of California at Berkeley, to develop a new theory of the labor market that remains an influential justification for the Federal Reserve's ability to stimulate job growth.
Employers, they asserted, often seek to improve morale by paying more than the minimum necessary wage, which has the effect of preventing some people from finding jobs. And during periods of high unemployment, they said, monetary stimulus can increase demand for labor -- a direct rebuttal to the classical view, which left little role for the Fed in combating unemployment.
Thirty years later, Ms. Yellen and the debate about the Fed's abilities have both moved from the theoretical world of academia to the Fed itself. As the central bank's vice chair since 2010, she has pressed for stronger measures to reduce unemployment, battling the doubts of other Fed officials about the value of continuing to expand the Fed's enormous stimulus campaign.
Ms. Yellen, 67, now finds herself as President Obama's nominee to succeed the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, at the end of January, largely because many Democrats view Ms. Yellen as the best person to press that stimulus campaign and to strengthen financial regulation. Senate Democrats prevented the nomination of President Obama's first choice, Lawrence H. Summers.
For Ms. Yellen, who was drawn to study economics as a path into public service and aspired as a college student to work at the Fed, the top job at the central bank would be a logical if -- until only recently -- unexpected culmination. Her confirmation also would reinforce the Fed's evolution from an institution run by market-wise bureaucrats focused on controlling inflation to an institution run by academics committed to a broader mission of steady growth and minimal unemployment.
Ms. Yellen's intellectual roots and leadership style both suggest that she would push somewhat more forcefully than Mr. Bernanke to extend the Fed's stimulus campaign, according to a careful review of her career and interviews with more than two dozen colleagues and acquaintances.
She has expressed greater concern about the economic consequences of unemployment, a stronger conviction in the Fed's ability to stimulate job growth and a greater willingness to tolerate a little more inflation in order to reduce unemployment more quickly. Until recently, her emphasis on unemployment would likely have disqualified her for the job, and it has already inspired opposition from some Senate Republicans and investors concerned that she would not be sufficiently vigilant in guarding against inflation.
Ms. Yellen is also a more assertive leader than Mr. Bernanke and appears less averse to conflict. While both encourage open debate and seek to make decisions by consensus, Ms. Yellen has been a more vocal and persistent advocate for her own views. Mr. Bernanke has allowed Fed officials to air their views freely, while Ms. Yellen has expressed concern that the cacophony undermines the Fed's effectiveness by sowing confusion about the direction of policy.
"I think she is fundamentally committed to continuity, that we still have a problem and we still need monetary policy to be doing a fair amount," said Christina D. Romer, a former chairwoman of Mr. Obama's Council of Economic Advisers and a close friend of Ms. Yellen. "There's a toughness there. And I think there's a toughness to her that there isn't in Bernanke."
Yet it is easy to overstate the changes Ms. Yellen likely would bring. She would be the first Democrat to lead the Fed in nearly three decades, but a liberal central banker is something different from -- and more conservative than -- a liberal politician. She was instrumental in the Fed's decision last year to declare a target of 2 percent annual inflation, and has shown only a very limited willingness to tolerate higher inflation.
On regulatory issues, too, Ms. Yellen's views are closer to those of the Obama administration than to those of the left-leaning Democrats most fervently seeking her nomination. She believes markets are imperfect and require significant regulation. But she favored the emergence in the 1990s of financial giants like Citigroup and has not supported calls for their breakup.
And Ms. Yellen may find her own instincts constrained by the increasingly restive minority of Fed officials who want to start pulling back from the stimulus campaign.
Richard W. Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas -- who will become a voting member of the Fed's policy-making committee next year as part of a regular rotation -- is among those officials. Of Ms. Yellen, he said last week, "She's wrong on policy, but she's a darn good, decent, wonderful person."
Ms. Yellen, like many economists of her generation, was drawn to the field by an interest in the Great Depression. Economics allowed her to combine a love for the rigor of mathematics with a desire to work on issues affecting people's lives.
Born in Brooklyn in 1946, she was raised in Bay Ridge, a middle-class neighborhood across the waterfront from Staten Island. Her mother, a teacher with an interest in finance, stayed home to raise Janet and her brother, John. Her father, a family doctor, saw patients in a home office he closed on Wednesday afternoons so the family could spend time together.
Some of Ms. Yellen's classmates at Fort Hamilton High School, from which she graduated in 1963, remember a smart and devoted student who seemed a little removed from their teenage world of music, parties and political ferment.
"She was a good friend and a good companion," said Charles Saydah, who was in many of Ms. Yellen's classes and hung out with the same group of friends, which he described as "the kids who were interested in folk songs." But "from where I was sitting," Mr. Saydah added, "it was clear that this was a way station to better things" for her.
Each year, the editor of the student newspaper interviewed the class valedictorian. Ms. Yellen was both, so she interviewed herself. She talked about her love of travel, her rock collection -- "I've been collecting rocks since I was eight and have over 200 different specimens" -- and her plans for college.
"I've decided to major in math or anthropology or economics or ..." she wrote. After enrolling at Brown University, it did not take long to narrow the list.
"She took her first economics course and came home and gave me the one-hour lecture on why economics was the greatest thing going," Susan Grosart, a childhood friend, said, recalling the Christmas vacation of their freshman year. "It was pretty obvious from then on that that was her passion."
Ms. Yellen decided to pursue a doctorate at Yale University after hearing a speech by James Tobin, the economist whom she still regards as her intellectual hero. Mr. Tobin was a staunch defender of the view that government policy could lift an economy from recession. She also admired the way he mixed academic work with public service.
"He encouraged his students to do work that was about something," Ms. Yellen told The Yale Daily News after Mr. Tobin's death in 2002. "Work that would not only meet a high intellectual standard, but would improve the well-being of mankind."
Ms. Yellen and Mr. Akerlof spent much of the 1980s trying to understand unemployment -- at the office, at the dinner table and on vacation in Hawaii, where they rarely entered the water, preferring to read economics books on the beach.
The couple met in 1977 in a cafeteria at the Fed, where both had taken research positions. Ms. Yellen had not secured tenure after six years as a junior professor at Harvard University; Mr. Akerlof had been denied a full professorship at Berkeley.
"We liked each other immediately and decided to get married," Mr. Akerlof wrote in a personal history after winning the Nobel Prize in 2001. "Not only did our personalities mesh perfectly, but we have also always been in all but perfect agreement about macroeconomics. Our lone disagreement is that she is a bit more supportive of free trade than I."
They were both Keynesians, believers in the view that people act irrationally, markets function imperfectly and the resulting problems are not self-correcting; the government must help.
"While admirers of capitalism, we also to a certain extent believe it has limitations that require government intervention in markets to make them work," Ms. Yellen said in a 2012 interview with Berkeley's business school magazine.
Friends describe Mr. Akerlof as a fountain of ideas, some brilliant, many indifferent. Ms. Yellen, they said, helped to frame a research agenda. She was a more rigorous thinker, and skilled at building and manipulating the theoretical models that are the primary tools of economic research.
"He would float an idea and she would say, 'Here are the nine reasons that's stupid,"' said the Berkeley economist David H. Romer, a longtime friend. "And if she could only think of four reasons," Mr. Romer said, then that was an idea worth discussing. He added, "It was an incredibly fruitful partnership."
In the summer of 1981, after returning to Berkeley, the couple were looking simultaneously for child care and for an explanation of an old riddle: The persistence of unemployment. As it happened, they would find both in the same place.
"Faculty couple seeks child care person," read the classified ad in the July 24, 1981, edition of The Daily Californian, Berkeley's student newspaper. "Good pay."
It may seem obvious that many people without jobs would rather be working, but it is not so easy to explain why they cannot find work simply by reducing the price of their labor until companies find it profitable to hire them. In other words, during periods of high unemployment, why don't companies cut wages rather than laying off workers?
The answer put forward by Ms. Yellen and Mr. Akerlof sprung from their observation that people often overpaid baby sitters. They argued in a series of papers that many employers chose to pay workers more than the cost of replacements because higher morale resulted in higher productivity. During recessions, when the market price of labor is falling, employers similarly refrain from cutting wages because lower morale would diminish productivity. Employers do not save money if output falls too.
"Firms don't just try to pay as little as possible to get the needed bodies on board; when there is unemployment, they ask themselves how wage cuts would affect the behavior of the employees," Ms. Yellen said in a 1995 interview. "Would they quit or feel dissatisfied and work less hard on the firm's behalf if they feel that wage policies are unfair?"
This reluctance to adjust wages, in turn, helps to explain why monetary policy works. When the Fed tries to stimulate the economy by increasing the availability of money, it is clear that spending increases. But economists have long debated whether the result is that people buy more goods and services or simply pay higher prices for the same things. In other words, does monetary stimulus just cause inflation, or can it also produce economic growth?
The argument hinged on whether prices adjusted quickly. Defenders of monetary stimulus argued that the price of labor, in particular, was "sticky" -- wages often did not adjust quickly. People were spending 10 percent more money, companies were earning 10 percent more, but wages remained the same. As a result, companies could afford more workers.
Ms. Yellen and Mr. Akerlof saw their theory as an explanation for the stickiness of wages. Perceptions of fairness, they said, might not be immediately affected by changes in the money supply. At least some employers would not adjust wages. And as a result, stimulus could increase growth.
Other economists advanced competing explanations for "sticky wages." The economist whose account most closely resembled Ms. Yellen's and Mr. Akerlof's, in their view, was none other than Mr. Summers, Ms. Yellen's rival to succeed Mr. Bernanke.
Ms. Yellen also collaborated with Mr. Akerlof, and sometimes other colleagues, on a string of other projects that used economic analysis to grapple with policy issues. They analyzed the profitability of East German companies and proposed policies to ease unemployment during unification; they evaluated crime prevention strategies and found evidence for the importance of encouraging community members to report crimes; they evaluated the causes of out-of-wedlock births and warned that proposed changes in welfare benefits were unlikely to make a difference.
Ms. Yellen also was a devoted teacher. She wrote lecture notes in longhand and Andrew K. Rose, a Berkeley colleague, recalled that she would begin by writing, "Hello. My name is Janet Yellen."
Students recall her patience and willingness to explain concepts repeatedly. Those who took her macroeconomics class in the years after she returned from her first tour of duty in Washington also remember her stories about life there.
"She would talk about the cafeteria at the Federal Reserve," said Kathy Poettcker, who took Ms. Yellen's class in 2003. "She'd tell you, 'You'd think it's some elaborate sort of setup, that there should be place mats and servers and white linen. Instead it was cottage cheese and canned fruit on a plastic plate.' She'd laugh and you're realize she's just a normal person doing normal things."
Ms. Yellen's first term on the Fed's board of governors, for three years beginning in 1994, foreshadowed the positions she has taken in recent years.
President Clinton nominated her alongside another liberal academic, the Princeton economist Alan S. Blinder, to temper the market-oriented conservatism of the Fed's chairman, Alan Greenspan. Appointing academics was an unusual step at the time. When Ms. Yellen met Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen at his home outside San Diego -- while Mr. Akerlof waited outside in a rental car -- she came armed with examples of the research insights she could bring to policy making.
Ms. Yellen was the rare Fed official to challenge Mr. Greenspan and succeed. In 1996, she marshaled academic research, including a paper she had encouraged Mr. Akerlof to write, to argue that the Fed should seek to moderate inflation rather than eliminate it. The research showed that a little inflation helped to minimize unemployment. Employers that were reluctant to impose wage cuts could instead allow inflation to erode the real value of wages, allowing them to reduce labor costs.
After she returned to the board in 2010, Ms. Yellen built internal support to formalize this view by establishing a 2 percent target for annual inflation.
In a related debate in 1995, Ms. Yellen argued that reducing high unemployment should sometimes be the Fed's highest priority, even above holding down inflation. The bitter aftertaste of the 1970s, when the Fed let inflation soar as it sought lower unemployment, had rendered such views all but sacrilegious for more than a generation, but Ms. Yellen argued that the Fed had allowed the pendulum to swing too far.
"To me, a wise and humane policy is occasionally to let inflation rise even when inflation is running above target," she said. She would make a similar argument last year as she built support for the Fed's December announcement that it would tolerate projected inflation as high as 2.5 percent in the service of reducing unemployment.
In the mid-1990s, however, both concerns -- that inflation would fall too low or that unemployment would rise too high -- were purely theoretical. Indeed, unemployment had fallen to such a low level that many Fed officials had begun to worry that a rise in inflation was inevitable.
But in a 1996 memo that Mr. Greenspan gratefully distributed to the policy-making committee, Ms. Yellen carefully articulated the case he had been trying to make: The Fed could afford to keep rates low because the economy was changing. Productivity was increasing even as global competition was suppressing the ability of workers to bargain for wage increases.
This record has led some critics to charge that Ms. Yellen is insufficiently committed to price stability.
"I think she's just entirely too easy money," Julian Robertson, the noted investor, said Monday on CNBC, arguing that her tolerance of inflation could lead to excesses like the run-up in house prices that led to the financial crisis. "I think we've got to remember that we're not very far from the last bubble bursting."
Ms. Yellen was less successful in influencing fiscal policy during a two-year stint as the head of Mr. Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers. A careful thinker who likes to consider issues from many sides, she was not well matched to the work of an internal think tank expected to offer quick commentary on a wide range of economic issues. She also found herself outside the circle of the president's closest advisers.
Peter R. Orszag, then a special assistant to the president for economic policy and later Mr. Obama's budget director, said in a recent interview that Ms. Yellen did well in both jobs. However, he said, "I could see why people believe she's particularly good at situations in which there are important decisions to be made that involve pulling facts and weighing consequences carefully without pulling the trigger right away."
Many of Mr. Obama's advisers worked with Ms. Yellen in the Clinton administration, and some argued that Mr. Summers was better suited to managing crises, including problems that might arise during the Fed's retreat from its stimulus campaign.
J. Bradford DeLong, a Berkeley economist and former Clinton administration official who gave public voice to these views, wrote in August that in "normal times" he would have favored Ms. Yellen, but given the weakness of the economy, he favored Mr. Summers because "a lot of outside-the-box thinking will be called for."
Ms. Yellen returned to the Fed in 2004 as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, one of the 12 branches that conduct research, supervise local banks and participate in setting monetary policy.
The staff economists assigned to give Ms. Yellen her first briefing on labor market conditions were already a bit nervous about their new boss, who was by far the most accomplished economist in the room. But they thought she might listen in silence, as the bank's previous president had done.
She waited only one sentence before interrupting.
"Well, wait a minute," Ms. Yellen said. "What about this?" And then her hands began to trace a graph in the air.
"The shock on the collective faces of us -- it was both freeing and suddenly you're in a different world," recalled Mary C. Daly, now the bank's associate director of research. "Where's Janet going to go? It just raised the game."
Ms. Yellen demonstrated considerable economic insight over the next several years. She was the first Fed official, in 2005, to describe the rise in housing prices as a bubble that might damage the economy. She was also the first, in 2008, to say that the economy had fallen into recession. And in early 2009, she warned of an "extended period of stagnation," dismissing concerns about imminent inflation.
Her warnings before the crisis, however, were tentative and inconsistent. "I never said for sure there was a bubble, but that it was a possibility," Ms. Yellen said in September 2006. "I guess I was inclined to think maybe there was. But I have seen what has happened in the last year or so, and now I'm more dubious." Moreover, she did not advocate for a change in Fed policy.
The San Francisco Fed also did little to constrain the excesses and abuses of banks under its supervision, including two of the nation's largest mortgage lenders, Wells Fargo and Countrywide Financial. Its performance was no worse than the other regional reserve banks, however. They were all taking orders from the Fed's board of governors, which had issued instructions not to scrutinize the subprime lending arms of banks like Wells Fargo.
Although Ms. Yellen had no formal role in financial supervision, she requested monthly briefings and sought to raise alarms in Washington. She did not, however, try to constrain lenders unilaterally. "I honestly don't know if we could have done that," she told the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission in 2010. "I don't think we felt empowered to do it."
She was still on the sidelines as the crisis began. Fed officials in Washington and New York, led by Mr. Bernanke and Timothy F. Geithner, managed efforts to arrest the collapse. But after Mr. Obama's election, Ms. Yellen knew she could be recalled to Washington. One friend recalled that at a certain point, when the subject came up, Ms. Yellen stopped saying "That's inconceivable" and started saying, "That's all I need now."
In April 2012, Ms. Yellen told a New York audience that the Fed had not done enough to stimulate the economy in the aftermath of the great recession. Ms. Yellen, like most of Fed officials, had underestimated the depth of the recession and overestimated the strength of the recovery. The speech was part of a campaign of many months, most of it waged behind the scenes, to convince her colleagues that the Fed could and should do more.
But some Fed officials were waxing skeptical about the Fed's capacity to provide additional help, or worrying about the potential cost. In the months after the April speech, Ms. Yellen's advocacy would be drawn into increasingly sharp contrast with the views of the newest professor on the Fed's board, the Harvard economist Jeremy C. Stein, who began to fret publicly that the central bank's efforts could destabilize financial markets.
Ms. Yellen's views have prevailed so far. She is not personally close with Mr. Bernanke, but they respect each other and have broadly agreed about monetary policy, according to people familiar with the relationship. Together with a number of allies, they forged a consensus in the fall of 2012 for the Fed to expand both of its principal campaigns to spur job creation: more asset purchases, and an extended commitment to low interest rates.
Last month, despite mounting internal pressure to scale back the bond purchases, Ms. Yellen and her allies prevailed again. The Fed surprised investors by announcing that it would postpone any retreat as a renewal of Washington's episodic fiscal crisis once again threatened the recovery.
The Fed's stance has been a disappointment to some observers who believe stronger action is required to reduce unemployment more quickly, even as it continues to worry those who fear the Fed has exhausted its abilities.
The inconsistent, sometimes contradictory pronouncements of Fed officials in recent months also have roused the ire of investors who find the Fed's new transparency more confusing at times than its former obfuscation.
Ms. Yellen has largely avoided public comment since June, seeking to avoid any impression that she is campaigning for Mr. Bernanke's job. It seems likely that she will next speak at a confirmation hearing later this year.
But her views have held remarkably steady over the last three decades: When unemployment is high, the Fed has an obligation to try.
Returning to Yale in 1999, Ms. Yellen summarized the lesson she had learned from Professor Tobin and carried with her into public service.
"Will capitalist economies operate at full employment in the absence of routine intervention? Certainly not," she said. "Do policy makers have the knowledge and ability to improve macroeconomic outcomes rather than make matters worse? Yes."

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- President Obama will nominate Janet L. Yellen as chairwoman of the Federal Reserve on Wednesday, White House officials said Tuesday night, ending an unusually prolonged and public search to fill one of the most important economic policy-making jobs in the world.
Ms. Yellen, 67, has been the Fed's vice chairwoman since 2010, when Mr. Obama nominated her to the post and she was easily confirmed on a voice vote by the Senate. She would be the first woman to run the central bank.
She is also expected to win bipartisan support for her new role in the Democratic-controlled Senate, said Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York. But some Republicans could throw up hurdles. Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee voted against her appointment as vice chairman because of what he called "her dovish views on monetary policy," and he was already expressing reservations on Tuesday night about her nomination for the top job.
"We will closely examine her record since that time," said Mr. Corker, who sits on the Banking Committee, which must clear her nomination before it moves to the full Senate. "But I am not aware of anything that demonstrates her views have changed."
Ms. Yellen's nomination was widely expected, but she was not thought to be Mr. Obama's first choice for the job. For months, the speculation was that the president would nominate Lawrence H. Summers, a former adviser of Mr. Obama's. But Mr. Summers dropped out of the running on Sept. 15 in the face of opposition from Democratic senators. Some in the administration blamed Yellen advocates for churning up the opposition to Mr. Summers.
A native of Brooklyn, she was previously president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, a White House adviser, a Fed governor during the Clinton administration and a longtime professor at the University of California, Berkeley.
The most important decisions awaiting Ms. Yellen involve how quickly to wind down the expansionary monetary policy engineered by the current chairman, Ben S. Bernanke. Ms. Yellen worked closely with Mr. Bernanke, whose term ends on Jan. 31, in shaping and building support for that approach in an effort to stimulate the economy and bring down unemployment.
If anything, Ms. Yellen has wanted the Fed to take even more aggressive measures to lift growth, believing the risks of inflation are modest. But her views and Mr. Bernanke's appear close enough that markets have considered her potential ascension a sign of continuity at the Fed.
Both Ms. Yellen and Mr. Bernanke will join the president at 3 p.m. Wednesday in the East Room of the White House for a formal announcement. Since 2009, Mr. Obama had anticipated that he might eventually nominate Mr. Summers, who for the first two years of his presidency was chief White House economic adviser as director of the National Economic Council. Mr. Obama came to admire Mr. Summers, a former Treasury secretary in the Clinton administration, for the advice he provided at the depths of the recession and financial crisis. In contrast, he does not know Ms. Yellen well.
Mr. Obama's loyalty to Mr. Summers pitted him this summer against many progressives in his party's base, as well as liberal Democratic senators, who wanted him to make history by nominating Ms. Yellen.
Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, whose letter endorsing Ms. Yellen and signed by a third of Democratic senators helped turn the tide against Mr. Summers, said in a statement late Tuesday, "Today is a historic moment for the Federal Reserve, for women everywhere and for all of us who care about job creation."
Administration officials and allies said the timing of the Yellen announcement had nothing to do with the fiscal impasse between the White House and the Republican-controlled House. Instead, they said, it was a coincidence caused by Mr. Obama's delay in deciding finally on Ms. Yellen, and getting her vetted, after Mr. Summers withdrew from contention.
Mr. Bernanke, the Fed's leader since 2006, announced last month that the central bank would postpone any retreat from its stimulus campaign for at least another month and possibly until next year, because of concerns about the economy. The move surprised economists and investors on Wall Street.
Mr. Bernanke -- who has underestimated the economy's weakness at several junctures during the last few years -- said that although conditions were improving, the Fed still feared a turn for the worse. He has expressed concern that Congress is damaging the economy through budget brinkmanship and could cause more damage in the weeks to come. Since then, several Fed officials have publicly questioned his decision in September, highlighting a growing divide over the course of policy that would number among Ms. Yellen's immediate challenges.
Ms. Yellen, described by one former colleague as "a small lady with a large I.Q.," forged an academic career at Berkeley as a member of the economics counterculture that attacked the dogma of efficient markets. She has long argued that markets benefit from regulation to prevent abuses and limit disruptions of economic growth.
The Fed's two main tasks are helping to regulate the financial system and altering interest rates in response to economic growth and inflation. Regulating the financial system has become a much more important part of the Fed's responsibilities in the wake of the financial crisis.
Many Democrats believe Ms. Yellen is likely to view Wall Street more skeptically than Mr. Summers, even though her views are closer to the centrist stance of the administration than to the positions of liberal Democrats on several regulatory issues. She is not, for example, a supporter of the push to break up large banks.
In the Senate, Republicans have frequently expressed concern that the Fed's policies may destabilize financial markets and eventually accelerate inflation.Republican senators have typically threatened to filibuster major bills and nominations in recent years, suggesting Ms. Yellen may need 60 votes -- including a handful of Republican votes -- to be confirmed. A decade ago, Ms. Yellen was one of the first public officials to describe rising housing prices as a bubble that might pop, with damaging consequences for the broader economy. Still, as president of the San Francisco Fed, she did not translate her concerns into actions that might have prevented some of the worst effects of the bubble.
But in the aftermath of the resulting recession, she accurately predicted that the recovery would be painfully slow and that there was little reason to worry about inflation, a view that led her to press for the Fed to expand its efforts to revive the economy. No Federal Reserve chairman has been as deeply steeped in both the theory and practice of central banking as she is.
Mr. Bernanke also brought a distinguished academic history of having studied the Fed, but he spent only a few years as a Fed governor before becoming chairman. Ms. Yellen has spent more than half of the last 20 years as a top Fed official.
Until recently, she was telling friends that she did not expect to be nominated because Mr. Obama had made it clear that he wanted Mr. Summers for the Fed job. But when Mr. Summers withdrew his name on Sept. 15, Ms. Yellen became the front-runner by elimination.
As speculation swirled about the appointment, much of the debate revolved not around economic policy but gender. Mr. Summers, while he was president of Harvard, once wondered aloud whether inherent differences between men and women helped explain a lack of female science professors, causing some women's groups to oppose his selection to lead the Fed. But within the White House, women were among his biggest supporters.
Some Democrats also argued that Mr. Obama should not pass up the chance to break a glass ceiling, given Ms. Yellen's qualifications and her position as the Fed's second-ranking official. No woman has held one of the very top jobs in economic policy-making -- Fed leader or Treasury secretary -- nor has a woman led any other major central bank in the world.
Mr. Summers's supporters, including many of the president's closest advisers, had raised some concerns about Ms. Yellen in recent months. Perhaps most potently, they said that institutions benefited from fresh leadership and argued that Ms. Yellen's central role in creating the Fed's current policies could inhibit her ability to make necessary changes.
Her supporters have praised her as self-effacing and keenly intelligent. "She makes an argument on the merits and she sticks with it," said Alan S. Blinder, an economics professor at Princeton and former Fed vice chairman, who argued for her nomination. "And she's good at articulating an argument in a way that doesn't leave people on the other side hopping mad at her."
President Bill Clinton nominated her to a seat on the Fed's board of governors in 1994 and then named her head of his Council of Economic Advisers in late 1996. She later returned to Berkeley, and in 2004 became president of the San Francisco Fed, where she remained during the worst of the financial crisis before returning to the Fed as vice chairman in 2010.
Ms. Yellen, slight and white-haired, has a personal style that more closely resembles Mr. Bernanke's soft-spoken manner than that of some previous Fed chairmen, like Paul Volcker. The force of her arguments can catch people by surprise.
She attended Fort Hamilton High School in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, and Brown University, and has said that she became interested in economics as a way of thinking logically about how to help people. As a graduate student at Yale, she studied under the Nobel laureate James Tobin, a leading proponent of the view that governments could mitigate recessions.
She built an academic career at Berkeley together with her husband, the economist George A. Akerlof, whom she met in a Fed cafeteria in the late 1970s when they were staff economists. Much of their work together highlighted flaws in the economic theory that markets operate efficiently, a theory that basically treats government policy as inherently costly. Ms. Yellen would be the first Democrat to run the Fed in almost 30 years. With Ms. Yellen's nomination, Mr. Obama will need to find a new vice chair for the seven-member board of governors. He also may need to fill three of the other seats. Elizabeth Duke resigned from the board in August; Sarah Bloom Raskin has been nominated to serve as deputy Treasury secretary; and Jerome Powell's term ends in January, although he can continue to serve in the absence of a replacement.

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDEDHOUSTON -- OVER the last few months, as an Egyptian government fell in a coup, the United States considered an attack on Syria and disgruntled Libyan terminal guards blocked oil exports, the only predictable news was the rise in oil prices to levels not seen in more than two years.
It all seemed distressingly similar to previous oil shocks. That is, until the higher prices suddenly retreated, along with President Obama's plans to retaliate for Syria's apparent use of chemical weapons.
What is the lesson of the summer minispike? Are we poised to return to $145-a-barrel oil and $4.50-a-gallon gasoline? The answer from most energy experts is probably not, because the fundamental global oil demand and supply equation has changed so drastically over the last three years.
Even before the collapse of plans to attack Syria and the new overtures of Iran to improve relations with the West, the financial company Raymond James published a report forecasting a lowering of oil prices from $109 in 2013 to $95 in 2014 and $90 in 2015. Some analysts are predicting even lower prices, and not only because of the frenzy of shale drilling in the United States and rapid oil sands development in Canada.
"Oil prices at about $100 a barrel is at a sweet spot," said Paul Bledsoe, senior fellow in the Climate and Energy Program at the German Marshall Fund. "It's high enough to incentivize remarkable investment in new production techniques and equally large investments in efficiency improvements. And the underlying factor of relatively modest economic growth seems to be with us for quite a while."
Predictions about oil and gasoline prices are precarious when there are so many political and security hazards. But it is likely that the world has already entered a period of relatively predictable crude prices. Even at their highest point in late summer, oil prices remained roughly 25 percent below levels of five years ago, not counting inflation, and gasoline prices on Labor Day weekend were at multiyear lows. And while oil slightly above $100 a barrel oil and nearly $3.50-a-gallon gasoline are high by historical measures, they are at a surprisingly benign level given the on-and-off disruptions in the Middle East and North Africa over the last three years.
No doubt there will still be bumps like this summer's. But there are reasons to believe the inevitable tensions in oil-producing countries will be manageable over at least the next few years, because the world now has sturdier shock absorbers than at any time over at least the last decade. The new oil equation combines multiple factors that span the globe, and most promise to be more permanent than the lackluster performance of the global economy, which no doubt has suppressed energy demand.
On the supply side, more oil production in the United States, Canada, Iraq and Saudi Arabia has compensated for the loss of exports from Iran, Libya and other trouble spots. The spread of American shale-drilling technology and skill to developing countries promises to raise oil production around the world, particularly in non-OPEC countries with large untapped shale fields like Mexico, Argentina, China, Australia and Russia.
That may not be good news for the environment, but it could soften pressure on corporate and consumer budgets, at least in the short term.
More friendly to the environment have been changes on the demand side of the energy equation. Auto fuel efficiency is improving by an average of 3 or 4 percent a year because of improved designs and tougher government regulation. New standards in the United States since 2007 have been followed by mandates in Europe, Japan and Canada. Most important, new standards will take effect in China in 2015, which is critical since its vehicle fleet continues to expand at a rapid rate.
"The greatest source of energy into the future is learning how to use it more efficiently," said William M. Colton, Exxon Mobil's vice president for corporate strategic planning. He projected that over the next 30 years, the world economy would roughly double in size while its energy needs would increase by a little more than a third.
Mr. Colton was nearly as sanguine about the future for oil supplies. "When we talk about stability, the key is to have a diversity of supplies to meet the global need for energy, and I would say the world is moving toward having more sources from more places and that tends to bring more stability."
Such price stability will bring with it winners and losers. Several producing countries like Venezuela, Nigeria and Saudi Arabia, which depend heavily on oil earnings to finance their governments and social programs, may be in for a shock. That could strengthen the position of the United States and even China, but more instability in places like the Middle East could have unpredictable consequences for the world at large.
Countries with large shale oil resources, like Argentina, Australia and Pakistan, stand to benefit. Mexico is particularly well positioned, now that the government is rewriting its oil laws to encourage foreign investment, potentially increasing its ability to pump 25 percent more oil out of the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico and onshore oil shale fields.
Michael Lynch, president of Strategic Energy and Economic Research, a consultancy, said stable oil prices could reduce future inflation rates and particularly curb transportation costs, helping to steady prices of food and construction materials that travel long distances. Lower inflation, he noted, can also help reduce interest rates. "By reducing uncertainty," Mr. Lynch said, "investor and consumer confidence should both be increased, boosting higher spending and investment, and thus economic growth."
Just as there have been several periods of extreme oil price turbulence since the 1960s, there have also been periods -- the last one being between 1987 and 2004 -- when drivers drove into their corner gas station with little to complain about.
It is easy to forget that low oil prices were once taken for granted, encouraging families to "see the U.S.A. in your Chevrolet." After World War II, the United States had an abundance of oil and little reason to conserve it, and if anybody supported its price at all it was the Texas Railroad Commission, which regulated the output of America's giant oil patch. But by the early 1970s, United States oil production had peaked and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries began to impose its will on global oil markets with boycotts and production quotas.
Of course, OPEC overreached, and the high oil prices and long lines at the pump spurred the United States and Europe to find more oil and conserve it. Global oil demand declined 10 percent from 1979 to 1983, and oil production among countries outside of OPEC expanded by more than 12 percent. Oil prices quickly came down to earth, and OPEC's command over global oil prices never totally recovered.
When global oil prices ramped up again between 2004 and 2008 from $30 to more than $140 a barrel, OPEC was no longer the primary cause. Rather, this time it was a chaotic gyration of supply interruptions. Nigerian rebels were damaging oil pipelines. President Hugo Chávez's revolution jolted Venezuela's state oil company into disarray. Oil production was in free fall in Mexico, the North Sea and the United States. On the demand side, a middle class with a taste for gas-guzzling cars was suddenly sprouting in China, India and other parts of the developing world at a rate that would have been unimaginable only a couple of decades before.
The financial crisis put a jolting brake to the trend, sending oil prices down to below $50 a barrel for a time in late 2008 before bouncing back to the $100 level the last few years -- and above that when strife in the Middle East and North Africa spooked traders.
But even as the Brent crude benchmark price leapt to $116 a barrel this August, American consumers felt little at the pump. In fact, gasoline prices in the United States actually declined by a few cents a gallon over the month, and they continue to fall.
Why?
"There is enough oil," said Miguel Galluccio, chief executive of YPF, the Argentine national oil company. "If tomorrow you have major military action in the Middle East, the speculators will panic and push the price to $130 a barrel, but then it will come back down again. The source of supply is there."
In fact, American oil supplies increased at the height of this summer's Middle East crisis and driving season, allowing many refineries to ramp up production to meet demand without a hitch. The United States continues to consume more than 20 percent of world oil supplies, but now, once again, it also produces an increasing share of world supplies even as Russia and Saudi Arabia pump more.
Just as the Arab boycotts of an earlier era spurred robust exploration in Alaska and the development of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, the recent oil price spike from 2004 to 2008 spurred an even more impressive expansion of domestic drilling across Texas, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Louisiana and in the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico.
American oil production alone has mushroomed by roughly three million barrels a day in the last six years to the highest levels in nearly a quarter of a century, and it should continue to grow from a current 7.6 million barrels a day to 9 million barrels a day by the end of the decade, Faisal Khan, managing director of Citi Research, told a Senate committee this summer.
Turner, Mason & Company, a Dallas-based engineering consulting firm, projects a low-case forecast of 9.5 million barrels produced domestically by 2022, which would be just short of the record of 9.6 million barrels produced in the United States in 1970. But its high forecast is 12 million barrels, potentially making the United States the world's biggest producer. Higher American production means Washington has greater flexibility to release strategic reserves should prices begin to rise in a way that threatens Western economies.
Canadian oil production is also rising fast because of the development of western oil sands, and experts say an increase in production of 200,000 barrels a year can be expected over the next decade, although an Obama administration decision to deny the proposed Keystone XL Pipeline could slow development.
"Strong production growth in the U.S. and Canada will serve to keep a lid on crude prices," a recent Turner, Mason study predicted. It also forecast that the benchmark price for Brent crude would average from $95 to $105 a barrel over the next decade, which is below current price levels.
And while the United States is producing more oil, it is consuming less year after year. The United States currently consumes a little more than 18 million barrels of oil a day -- more than 2 million barrels below peak consumption in 2005.
High unemployment is a major reason but far from the only one. Federal mandates for biofuel use have replaced nearly 10 percent of oil in gasoline production over the last five years, although corn ethanol production also burns fuel. Natural gas is chipping away at oil use for heating in the Northeast.
Energy experts note that more people are shopping online, more employees are telecommuting, and young adults are attracted to an urban lifestyle where work and play are closer to home. The American car fleet is gradually being replaced with autos that will be far more efficient under the new fuel mileage standards.
By 2018, the Paris-based International Energy Agency projects American oil demand could fall by more than a half million barrels a day, an additional decline of nearly 3 percent from current consumption.
And that could be conservative, especially if cheap natural gas replaces more oil as a transportation fuel. There are currently eight million heavy and medium-weight trucks on American roads consuming three million barrels of oil a day -- about 15 percent of total American oil consumption. With big transportation companies like United Parcel Service making the switch and natural gas stations spreading over the last few years, energy experts project that 30 percent of the fleet could shift from diesel to gas by the end of the decade.
With the United States producing more and importing less, the driver of global oil demand is quickly shifting to China, which has accounted for more than half of the global demand growth since 2008. The Energy Department predicts that China will surpass the United States as the world's largest importer of oil by late this year and it should remain that way for many years to come.
Millions of increasingly affluent Chinese, like the emerging middle class in India and other developing countries, are buying cars. But with the Chinese government beginning to put limits on car purchases in cities as a pollution control measure, the rate of growth in oil demand in China is already starting to ebb. Chinese oil demand declined slightly in the first half of 2013, although most experts say they believe demand will pick up again but at a slower rate.
"In a pattern similar to the abrupt slowdown in demand growth seen in the Asian Tigers in the 1990s," according to a recent Citigroup research report, "Chinese demand growth has slowed to a more tepid 3-5 percent (annual) rate as compared to the double-digit growth seen in the early 2000s."
The investment bank Canaccord Genuity projects a 3.5 to 4 percent annual growth rate in Chinese oil consumption for the next four years. But with demand expected to decline in Western Europe, several developed Asian countries and North America, the global demand growth should be just over 1 percent a year over the next several years. That is nowhere near the conditions that helped spur the price spike before the recession hit.
Countries around the world are getting on the efficiency bandwagon, not only improving auto efficiency standards but also gradually cutting fuel subsidies to ease government financial burdens. The growth in the liquefied natural gas export market is encouraging countries to substitute natural gas for oil in home heating and for industrial power generation.
The advent of American natural gas exports over the next decade, combined with growing supplies from shale drilling around the world, is likely to lower natural gas prices and speed up the replacement of petroleum products with gas for the petrochemical and other industries particularly in Asia. Just as the United States largely substituted natural gas for oil to generate power after the Arab oil boycotts of the 1960s and 1970s, China, India, Latin America and several Middle East countries are expected to follow suit over the next decade or so.
The swing from oil to natural gas as a transportation fuel is already spreading around the developing world from Argentina to Pakistan. China has been particularly proactive and already has more than 40,000 trucks fueled by liquefied natural gas.
"There is enough natural gas, and it is cheap enough and the technology is mature enough that for the first time we can talk seriously about fuel switching in transportation to natural gas," said Michael Webber, deputy director of the Energy Institute at the University of Texas at Austin. "And while oil is still dominant, we also have biofuels and electricity as options so the century-long monopoly that oil has enjoyed is starting to show some fissures."

Full text:   LONDON -- AS bad as things in Washington are -- the federal government shutdown since Tuesday, the slim but real potential for a debt default, a political system that seems increasingly ungovernable -- they are going to get much worse, for the United States and other advanced economies, in the years ahead.
From the end of World War II to the brief interlude of prosperity after the cold war, politicians could console themselves with the thought that rapid economic growth would eventually rescue them from short-term fiscal transgressions. The miracle of rising living standards encouraged rich countries increasingly to live beyond their means, happy in the belief that healthy returns on their real estate and investment portfolios would let them pay off debts, educate their children and pay for their medical care and retirement. This was, it seemed, the postwar generations' collective destiny.
But the numbers no longer add up. Even before the Great Recession, rich countries were seeing their tax revenues weaken, social expenditures rise, government debts accumulate and creditors fret thanks to lower economic growth rates.
We are reaching end times for Western affluence. Between 2000 and 2007, ahead of the Great Recession, the United States economy grew at a meager average of about 2.4 percent a year -- a full percentage point below the 3.4 percent average of the 1980s and 1990s. From 2007 to 2012, annual growth amounted to just 0.8 percent. In Europe, as is well known, the situation is even worse. Both sides of the North Atlantic have already succumbed to a Japan-style "lost decade."
Surely this is only an extended cyclical dip, some policy makers say. Champions of stimulus assert that another huge round of public spending or monetary easing -- maybe even a commitment to higher inflation and government borrowing -- will jump-start the engine. Proponents of austerity argue that only indiscriminate deficit reduction, accompanied by reforming entitlement programs and slashing regulations, will unleash the "animal spirits" necessary for a private-sector renaissance.
Both sides are wrong. It's now abundantly clear that forecasters have been too optimistic, boldly projecting rates of growth that have failed to transpire.
The White House and Congress, unable to reach agreement in the face of a fiscal black hole, have turned over the economic repair job to the Federal Reserve, which has bought trillions of dollars in securities to keep interest rates low. That has propped up the stock market but left many working Americans no better off. Growth remains lackluster.
The end of the golden age cannot be explained by some technological reversal. From iPad apps to shale gas, technology continues to advance. The underlying reason for the stagnation is that a half-century of remarkable one-off developments in the industrialized world will not be repeated.
First was the unleashing of global trade, after a period of protectionism and isolationism between the world wars, enabling manufacturing to take off across Western Europe, North America and East Asia. A boom that great is unlikely to be repeated in advanced economies.
Second, financial innovations that first appeared in the 1920s, notably consumer credit, spread in the postwar decades. Post-crisis, the pace of such borrowing is muted, and likely to stay that way.
Third, social safety nets became widespread, reducing the need for households to save for unforeseen emergencies. Those nets are fraying now, meaning that consumers will have to save more for ever longer periods of retirement.
Fourth, reduced discrimination flooded the labor market with the pent-up human capital of women. Women now make up a majority of the American labor force; that proportion can rise only a little bit more, if at all.
Finally, the quality of education improved: in 1950, only 15 percent of American men and 4 percent of American women between ages 20 and 24 were enrolled in college. The proportions for both sexes are now over 30 percent, but with graduates no longer guaranteed substantial wage increases, the costs of education may come to outweigh the benefits.
These five factors induced, if not complacency, an assumption that economies could expand forever.
Adam Smith discerned this back in 1776 in his "Wealth of Nations": "It is in the progressive state, while the society is advancing to the further acquisition, rather than when it has acquired its full complement of riches, that the condition of the labouring poor, of the great body of the people, seems to be the happiest and the most comfortable. It is hard in the stationary, and miserable in the declining state."
The decades before the French Revolution saw an extraordinary increase in living standards (alongside a huge increase in government debt). But in the late 1780s, bad weather led to failed harvests and much higher food prices. Rising expectations could no longer be met. We all know what happened next.
When the money runs out, a rising state, which Smith described as "cheerful," gives way to a declining, "melancholy" one: promises can no longer be met, mistrust spreads and markets malfunction. Today, that's particularly true for societies where income inequality is high and where the current generation has, in effect, borrowed from future ones.
In the face of stagnation, reform is essential. The euro zone is unlikely to survive without the creation of a legitimate fiscal and banking union to match the growing political union. But even if that happens, Southern Europe's sky-high debts will be largely indigestible. Will Angela Merkel's Germany accept a one-off debt restructuring that would impose losses on Northern European creditors and taxpayers but preserve the euro zone? The alternatives -- disorderly defaults, higher inflation, a breakup of the common currency, the dismantling of the postwar political project -- seem worse.
In the United States, which ostensibly has the right institutions (if not the political will) to deal with its economic problems, a potentially explosive fiscal situation could be resolved through scurrilous means, but only by threatening global financial and economic instability. Interest rates can be held lower than the inflation rate, as the Fed has done. Or the government could devalue the dollar, thereby hitting Asian and Arab creditors. Such "default by stealth," however, might threaten a crisis of confidence in the dollar, wiping away the purchasing-power benefits Americans get from the dollar's status as the world's reserve currency.
Not knowing who, ultimately, will lose as a consequence of our past excesses helps explain America's current strife. This is not an argument for immediate and painful austerity, which isn't working in Europe. It is, instead, a plea for economic honesty, to recognize that promises made during good times can no longer be easily kept.
That means a higher retirement age, more immigration to increase the working-age population, less borrowing from abroad, less reliance on monetary policy that creates unsustainable financial bubbles, a new social compact that doesn't cannibalize the young to feed the boomers, a tougher stance toward banks, a further opening of world trade and, over the medium term, a commitment to sustained deficit reduction.
In his "Future of an Illusion," Sigmund Freud argued that the faithful clung to God's existence in the absence of evidence because the alternative -- an empty void -- was so much worse. Modern beliefs about economic prospects are not so different. Policy makers simply pray for a strong recovery. They opt for the illusion because the reality is too bleak to bear. But as the current fiscal crisis demonstrates, facing the pain will not be easy. And the waking up from our collective illusions has barely begun.

Full text:   AFTER two difficult years, emerging-market stock funds posted solid gains in the third quarter, raising hope that this once-highflying asset class may be ready to rebound.
Yet many strategists and money managers caution investors not to get too excited.
For starters, the return of 5.2 percent. on average, for these funds still lagged behind the third-quarter gains of mutual and exchange-traded funds that focus on domestic, European or Japanese stocks. What's more, fundamental factors are likely to keep challenging developing economies like China, India and Indonesia, money managers said.
"I think we've entered a very difficult period for the emerging markets," said Lewis Kaufman, manager of the Thornburg Developing World fund, which has beaten 93 percent of its peers over the last year.
Mr. Kaufman noted that while economic activity in developing markets was still growing at a faster clip than in Europe and the United States, the gap was narrowing.
For instance, the difference between gross domestic product growth in China and the United States stood at about eight percentage points in 2010, according to IHS Global Insight. Today, that spread is down to around 5 points.
And one big tail wind that propelled the popularity of emerging-market equities and other risky assets -- the widespread availability of cheap credit globally -- has slackened.
Although the Federal Reserve announced last month that it was not yet ready to taper its aggressive bond-buying program, the central bank is still expected to eventually take its foot off the accelerator. And central banks throughout the emerging markets -- including Brazil, Indonesia and India -- have raised key rates in an effort to keep inflation in check and prop up their currencies.
"What has been driving some of the success in the emerging markets -- investment from developed countries to feed exports back into the developing world -- is starting to slow down," said Edward A. Gray, head of global and international value equities at Delaware Investments. "At the margin, things have gotten tougher to justify in the emerging markets."
Now there is heated debate about whether emerging-market stocks are good values, with bulls pointing out that these stocks are cheaper than average, based on certain measures.
Richard Titherington, head of J.P. Morgan Asset Management's emerging-markets equity team, notes that over the last 20 years, investors were smart to sell emerging-markets stocks when they traded at an average price-to-book value ratio of more than 2.5 and to buy when that ratio sank below 1.5.
In the summer, emerging-market stocks slipped below that threshold and rallied. Today, emerging-market equities trade at around 1.6 times their book value.
Yet Mark D. Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott, argues that the emerging-market stocks aren't necessarily cheap based on other measures.
For instance, the price-to-earnings ratio for the MSCI Emerging Markets index ended the third quarter at 11.2, based on projected profits; the figure is slightly higher than the comparable P/E of 11.0 for emerging-markets stocks when they peaked in May 2011. That's because emerging market earnings have actually contracted over the last two years.
So where does that leave investors? They must be much more selective than they were before.
"Let me be blunt: The universe of attractive opportunities is shrinking," said Mr. Kaufman at Thornburg. While pockets of strong growth can still be found in emerging markets, "the problem is the good stuff is increasingly carved out -- and expensive."
Corporate earnings among companies in the MSCI Emerging Markets index are expected to grow 12.8 percent a year for the next three to five years, according to estimates from Bloomberg. Some sectors in the index, like health care and consumer staples, are forecast to grow significantly faster. Yet the average P/E was already 23 at quarter's end for emerging-market health care stocks and more than 24 for consumer-staples companies, both based on expected earnings.
As a result, Mr. Kaufman said, "we're finding the need to be a little more creative." For example, a top holding of the Thornburg Developing World fund is Jerónimo Martins, a retailer. Because the company is headquartered in Portugal, the stock isn't on the radar of many emerging-market funds. Yet the company operates a large food store chain in Poland.
David J. Winters, manager of the Wintergreen Fund, which invests globally, said investors would do well to look past the macroeconomic "doom and gloom" and focus instead on individual emerging-market companies with strong balance sheets and growth.
"Ultimately, we like the consumer there," Mr. Winters said. "As people get wealthier in the emerging markets, there are certain things they want, need and just have to have."
Among companies that fall on this list, he said, are Wynn Macau, which operates a large casino and resort that caters to a wealthy Chinese customer base. "Whatever happens with Chinese growth in the short run or even in the long run, there are a lot of folks who want to go to Macau," he said, adding that the stock also pays a healthy dividend yield of more than 5 percent.
Arjun Jayaraman, co-manager of the Causeway Emerging Markets fund, said one strategy that makes sense is a barbell approach. In other words, he said, "have exposure to higher-growth parts of the emerging markets, but pair that with really beaten-down parts of the market where things are really cheap."
He notes that while many consumer-staples companies with attractive growth prospects trade at P/E ratios in the 20-to-25 range, there are numerous Chinese bank stocks, like Bank of China and the China Construction Bank Corporation, that trade at just 5 or 6 times earnings. Russian energy giants like Lukoil and Gazprom are even cheaper. "Valuation is still the most important thing," he said.
Mr. Jayaraman added that the emerging-market investment world "has become very heterogeneous."
No longer is this one big China play. Investors are weighing the fiscal health of individual markets. For example, with less cheap credit to drive investment dollars, countries with big current account deficits -- those that import more goods, services and investments than they export -- are more vulnerable. These are places like Indonesia, India, Turkey, South Africa and Brazil.
Even here, though, investors shouldn't simply flee these markets because of added worries over capital flows, said G. Rusty Johnson, co-manager of the Harding Loevner Emerging Markets Portfolio.
His fund hasn't sold out of fiscally strong companies in volatile positions in countries like Brazil and India. "Rather than selling the bad boys," he said, "we're nibbling."

Abstract: Programs that conservatives had tolerated at best were suddenly lavished with praise: nutrition assistance for women and children, federal medical research, national parks, the Smithsonian Institution, even the government of the District of Columbia, which was authorized to spend money to pick up Washington's trash, maintain its needle exchange program for intravenous drug users and even implement the health care law.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, a hard-core leader of House conservatives who helped force a government shutdown in a fight over the scope of federal health care spending, sent out a statement on Wednesday bragging that the House had voted to "fully fund the National Institutes of Health."
On Thursday, Representative Todd Rokita of Indiana, who was swept to power in the Tea Party wave of 2010, stepped up to a microphone in the basement of the Capitol to recount his son's struggles with a severe disability.
"Families, faith communities, associations and neighbors can take care of us better than government programs can," he said. "But government should be there to help."
"Science," he added, "is a gift."
Much of the federal government shut down on Tuesday because of a clash between Congressional Republicans and President Obama in which Republicans sought to tie further government financing to delaying or crippling his health care law. Beneath the mechanics lie deeper philosophical disagreements about spending, taxation and the size and scope of government.
But the week's events have blurred the divide. Republican leaders have offered mixed messages on the cause of the shutdown, and the House floor has played host to a parade of bills to restore government functions piece by piece, accompanied by rhetorical flourishes from ardent conservatives extolling the role of government in civic life and the selflessness of civil servants.
Representative Dennis A. Ross, a Florida Republican who was also elected in the 2010 Tea Party wave, said the party risked losing a fight over the scale of government while waging a quixotic war against the health care law. Though much of the government is shut down, he said, the Affordable Care Act, which is financed by its own appropriations, is moving forward unimpeded.
"Republicans have to realize how many significant gains we've made over the last three years -- and we have, not only in cutting spending but in really turning the tide on other things," Mr. Ross said. "We can't lose all that when there's no connection now between the shutdown and the funding of Obamacare."
"I think now it's a lot about pride," he said.
In one breath on Friday, Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio said the fiscal impasse was about bringing "fairness to the American people under Obamacare" and about doing "something about our spending problem."
And the central principle of Tea Party conservatism, an aggressive attack on government programs, has given way among a growing number of Republicans to a full-throated defense of federal functions as varied as national parks and nutrition programs for the impoverished.
On Friday evening, House Republicans voted unanimously to authorize $6.5 billion in new spending on the supplemental nutrition program for women, infants and children.
And in a rare weekend session, the House voted 407 to 0 on Saturday on a bill to guarantee that federal workers -- once denigrated by conservatives as overpaid and underworked -- will receive back pay once the government reopens.
At a hearing in 2011, Mr. Ross, the chairman of the House subcommittee on the federal work force, the Postal Service and labor policy, charged that "federal employees on average earned $101,628 in total compensation in 2010, nearly four times more than the average private-sector worker."
On Saturday, those workers were suddenly selfless civil servants: nurses and doctors saving lives, emergency workers braving natural disasters and NASA scientists exploring the frontiers of space.
"This has been an Orwellian week in which white is black and black is white," said Representative Gerald E. Connolly, Democrat of Virginia.
The budget deficit, in fact, has been one of the lowest priorities. Republicans first pressed to eliminate the health care law, a move that would actually have swelled the debt over time. (The Affordable Care Act's tax increases and spending cuts, mainly to Medicare, put it in the black.) When that failed, they scaled back their ambitions to eliminating a tax on medical devices that helps pay for the law, which would add $30 billion in red ink but do nothing to stop the law and what many conservatives see as government overreach.
After defending such actions by saying they were taking aim at a major new government program, House Republicans set about reassembling the government they had shut down, piece by piece. Programs that conservatives had tolerated at best were suddenly lavished with praise: nutrition assistance for women and children, federal medical research, national parks, the Smithsonian Institution, even the government of the District of Columbia, which was authorized to spend money to pick up Washington's trash, maintain its needle exchange program for intravenous drug users and even implement the health care law.
"We have bigger items to fight over now than needle exchange programs in D.C.," said Representative John Fleming, a Louisiana Republican who was once one of the fiercest supporters of taking a hard line on the shutdown. "I just think that is not as important as funding the N.I.H., funding the V.A., getting the government back open."
Asked how he could choose between enrolling children in federal cancer trials or returning them to Head Start classrooms, Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the majority leader, said, "That's coming as well."
"We ought to be working as hard as we can to open the parts of the government we all agree on," Mr. Cantor said -- which turns out to be quite a lot of the government.
A Head Start vote will come in the next week, along with bills to finance border security and enforcement, nuclear weapons security and development, Indian education and health services, education assistance for districts with large federal installations, and the Food and Drug Administration.
Mr. Obama and Democratic leaders in Congress oppose these piecemeal bills. Republicans cannot pick and choose what programs to finance and what programs to starve, they say, and reopening the most sensitive programs would relieve the political pressure on Republicans to reopen the government as a whole.
The House votes to restore financing to parts of the government followed efforts over two years to cut some of the very programs Republicans are now trying to rescue. The automatic spending cuts known as sequestration, which began in March and are now defended by most Republicans, cut $1.55 billion from the National Institutes of Health budget in the fiscal year that ended on Sept. 30. The spending bill for federal medical research in the 2014 fiscal year would have cut programs in the Labor Department and the Health and Human Services Department by 22 percent -- cuts so deep that Republican leaders did not even try to get them approved by the full House.
The House appropriations bill for the National Park Service would cut $343 million, or 13 percent, from the budget requested by the president, and $240 million from last year's level.
"It takes serious chutzpah for Republicans to portray themselves as the defenders of N.I.H., parks and other critical services they gutted through sequestration and proposed cutting further for 2014," said Representative Nita M. Lowey of New York, the ranking Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee.
The House's agriculture bill, which similarly did not get a vote in the full chamber, would have cut the president's request for the women, infants and children nutrition program by $488 million, even more than the $333 million sliced by sequestration.
Friday's debate over that financing bill brought Democrats practically to apoplexy.
"Are we meant to believe that today they have come to Jesus, or is this just politics?" Representative Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut sputtered on the House floor.
To moderate Republicans, the current debate might be a break from the relentless cutting that followed the Republican return to power in the House. Conservatives have been winning the argument on spending: the last fiscal year was the first time since 1996 that spending at the discretion of Congress fell in non-inflation-adjusted terms.
But the piece-by-piece examination of programs seems to be yielding a new appreciation for the federal government's role.
"There's a difference," said Representative Patrick Meehan, Republican of Pennsylvania, "between wanting to have a smaller government and wanting to have no government."

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- With his troops anxious for a way forward, Speaker John A. Boehner began a closed-door meeting of House Republicans on Friday morning with a recitation of letters from local schoolchildren on how they deal with stress.
A shower helps, one child counseled. So does a nap.
But on the matter causing all the Congressional stress, the speaker offered no clue as to how he expected Congress to get out of the dead end it has found itself in, with the government shut for a fourth day and no clear path to raise the federal debt limit to avoid the nation's first default. "We are locked in an epic battle," the speaker told his rank and file, those who attended the meeting said, urging them to "hang tough."
The overarching problem for the man at the center of the budget fight, say allies and opponents, is that he and his leadership team have no real idea how to resolve the fiscal showdown.
They are only trying to survive another day, Republican strategists say, hoping to maintain unity as long as possible so that when the Republican position collapses, they can capitulate on two issues at once -- financing the government and raising the debt ceiling -- and head off any internal party backlash. Republican lawmakers say Mr. Boehner has assured them privately that he will not permit a default.
Backers of the speaker say he does not have to fear a coup. His obvious successor, the majority leader, Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, is so caught up in the current legislative battle that he would probably be washed away with Mr. Boehner in a Tea Party putsch, and with no other obvious candidates in waiting, no such uprising is likely.
"I do not believe he's primarily concerned with saving his speakership. He's concerned with saving the House Republican Conference," said Vin Weber, a former Republican House member who advises the current House leadership.
If the speaker were to move on a stopgap spending bill now, without conservative policy priorities attached, it would most likely pass with Republican and Democratic votes. But the ensuing Republican uproar -- on and off Capitol Hill -- would ensure that there would be no Republican votes to raise the debt ceiling. "It's common-sense strategy," one Republican strategist said. "If you're going to take a bullet, you want to take just one."
It has been a long time since a House speaker has faced the many challenges confronting Mr. Boehner. On paper, he is the perfect man for the moment, a veteran Congressional institutionalist with a history of working with Democrats on big problems, and someone bruised by the memory of the last government shutdown and the harm it did to his party.
That John Boehner has faded, carried away by the Tea Party current that swept him to power and is now pulling him from the moorings of his past. His troops are badly fractured, with conservatives advocating one strategy and a growing band of pragmatists demanding the opposite.
Aides to Mr. Boehner, however, say the speaker has a clear vision of where he wants to end up in the current crisis, but is unwilling to lay out his goals until he has a Democratic partner with whom to negotiate. Democrats are openly disrespecting his leadership and disregarding his demands. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, suggested again on Friday that Mr. Boehner was putting his speakership over his country.
Even Republican allies say whatever strategy exists seems to be dictated not by the speaker, but by Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, the hard-line Republican who helped start the "Defund Obamacare" movement.
Asked what the House was doing, Representative Devin Nunes, Republican of California and a Boehner loyalist, said: "You really have to call Cruz, I'm not even joking about that. That's really what you have to do, because he's the one that set up the strategy, he's the one that got us into this mess, and so we've got to know what the next move is."
Democrats say they simply cannot trust the speaker to deliver. Mr. Reid said in an interview in his office on Friday that Mr. Boehner came to him at the end of July with a proposition: If Senate Democratic leaders could accept a stopgap spending measure in the fall at levels that reflected across-the-board spending cuts, the speaker would refrain from adding extraneous measures that could precipitate a clash.
Mr. Reid was leery, since that level -- $988 billion in discretionary spending for the 2014 fiscal year -- would be $70 billion less than the Senate-passed budget. "I didn't like it. I've got a couple of tough women to deal with," he said, referring to Senators Patty Murray of Washington, the chairwoman of the Budget Committee, and Barbara A. Mikulski of Maryland, chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee.
On Sept. 12, in a meeting of the top four Congressional leaders, Mr. Boehner said he was running into problems with a conservative groundswell demanding that a gutting of the health law accompany any spending measure. Mr. Reid and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, suggested a procedural step that would allow the House to vote on a stopgap spending bill with a side provision removing funds from the health care law that the Senate could strip out before sending the spending measure to the president.
Again, the speaker agreed. And again, he could not carry through, Mr. Reid said. "If I told him I would do something, I would do that," the Senate leader said.
At a White House meeting with the president this week, Mr. Boehner twice brought up quiet talks between Ms. Murray and Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the House Budget Committee chairman, as a way to end the impasse with a broad budget deal. The third time, Mr. Reid laughed out loud.
"I couldn't take it any longer. I said: 'Stop it. They've met a few times and talked about nothing. The meetings were only for you, for show,' " Mr. Reid said.
If Mr. Boehner is feeling pressure, he is not showing it, sticking to his longstanding routines. He began most mornings this week as he always does, with a long walk and breakfast at the counter of Pete's Diner a few blocks from the Capitol.
He has spent his days largely hunkered down inside his speaker's suite, shuttling between his office and his conference room, meeting with small groups of lawmakers. He talks, he listens, and he tries to buck them up: Hang in there and stick with the team has become something of mantra.
Representative Tom Cole, an Oklahoma Republican close to Mr. Boehner, said he believed that the speaker would like to see a deal that included a new way of calculating inflation that would slow the growth of federal benefits; a means testing for Medicare, as well as some other Medicare savings; and at least some slight changes to the Affordable Care Act, like a repeal of a medical device tax unpopular with some Democrats.
Mr. Cole said that Mr. Boehner wanted a broader negotiation that would involve current federal spending and the debt limit, one that "would move us towards some sort of -- if not grand bargain -- then big down payment on our fiscal problems," Mr. Cole said.
As for Mr. Boehner, on Friday he played down any personal animosity between him and his Democratic adversaries, but did show a flash of temper when he referred to suggestions from the White House that Democrats had the advantage. "This isn't some damn game," he said, his voice rising. "The American people don't want their government shut down, and neither do I."

Abstract: [...]the partial shutdown of the American government, depending on how long it continues, could undercut demand from the United States, the euro zone's most important trading partner. [...]the political impasse in Washington raises the risk that the United States will hit the debt ceiling and begin defaulting on its debt.

Full text:   PARIS -- The European Central Bank left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at a record low on Wednesday, but indicated it was ready to take steps if needed to protect the euro zone from political turmoil in the United States.
"The U.S. budget shutdown is a risk if protracted," Mario Draghi, the central bank president, said at a news conference. But he added that he did not expect the two-day-old shutdown to last long.
Mr. Draghi deflected a question about what would happen if the United States defaulted on its debt because of the deadlock in Washington. He emphasized, though, that the bank was poised to intervene if needed.
"We have a vast array of instruments," Mr. Draghi said. "And we exclude no option."
But no immediate moves were announced. Meeting in Paris, the central bank's governing council kept its main interest rate at 0.5 percent, where it has been since May.
In his news conference, Mr. Draghi repeated his assurance that the central bank would continue holding rates down, citing continued low inflation. He said the governing council had discussed a rate cut but remained divided on whether one was warranted.
Although the euro common currency is no longer under siege, tension in the euro zone has risen in recent weeks. There had been questions about the survival of the Italian government before Wednesday, when the opposition leader, Silvio Berlusconi, said he would support the government of Prime Minister Enrico Letta in a vote of confidence.
But the partial shutdown of the American government, depending on how long it continues, could undercut demand from the United States, the euro zone's most important trading partner. Moreover, the political impasse in Washington raises the risk that the United States will hit the debt ceiling and begin defaulting on its debt. Analysts agree a default would be catastrophic for the world economy.
The euro zone has emerged from a recession that lasted a year and a half, but it is a feeble recovery that could easily be derailed by an external shock. "We view this recovery as weak, as fragile, as uneven," Mr. Draghi said.
Europe has also been affected in recent months by expectations that the Federal Reserve in Washington would soon begin reducing its economic stimulus program -- a move that, when it comes, is likely to push up market interest rates at a time when many European countries are experiencing severe shortages of credit.
Last week, Mr. Draghi said the European Central Bank would consider a fresh installment of unlimited three-year loans to banks at the rock-bottom official interest rate. The low-cost loans are the closest thing that the European Central Bank has to the "quantitative easing" employed by the Fed, and it helps make sure that banks have plenty of cash. On Wednesday, though, Mr. Draghi declined to be specific about when such a move might be coming.
A government shutdown in the United States affects Europe because it unsettles financial markets, and because it reduces demand in the American market that is crucial for European exports -- everything from Italian Ferraris to French cosmetics.
"While the direct economic damage will probably be limited if government offices will be allowed to resume business after a couple of days, the political standoff will take its toll on sentiment," Asoka Wöhrmann, co-chief investment officer of Deutsche Asset and Wealth Management in Frankfurt, said in an e-mail. "It is a bad harbinger for the upcoming -- and potentially more serious -- debt ceiling decision" in Washington.
In addition, the shutdown could weaken the dollar. That tends to hurt European exporters because their products become more expensive in dollar terms and have a more difficult time competing in the United States or other foreign markets. On Wednesday, prompted in part by Mr. Draghi's resolve to keep rates low, the euro rallied to its highest level against the dollar since February, reaching a peak of $1.3606.
The European Central Bank has plenty of room to maneuver on monetary policy. Annual inflation in the euro zone fell to 1.1 percent in September, its lowest level in three and a half years and well below the bank's target of about 2 percent.
The central bank is sworn to defend price stability above all else, and in theory it should be considering ways to increase inflation slightly. There remains a risk, however slight, that the euro zone could experience deflation, a broad decline in prices that undercuts corporate profits and investment and is associated with economic depression. Deflation can be more destructive than inflation, because it is very hard to reverse.
Mr. Draghi said inflation was in line with expectations and gave no indication the central bank was pondering measures to push inflation higher. "Inflation expectations for the euro area remain firmly anchored," he said.

Full text:   CARACAS, Venezuela -- The start of the season for two premier teams in this baseball-loving nation was thrown into doubt after thieves stripped vast amounts of copper wire from the lights in this city's main stadium. Basic items are often so hard to find that when a truck driver slumped dead at the wheel after a highway accident last week, motorcycle-riding looters swarmed in to grab the cargo: tons of red meat.
Prices are soaring, the country is plagued by electrical blackouts, some neighborhoods go days without water, and protests tangle the already stifling traffic. To top it all off, the cheap beer that helps people let off steam at many a weekend party has suddenly become scarce, too.
Nearly seven months after the death of Hugo Chávez, the country's longtime leftist president and father figure, there is a growing sense that things are falling apart.
The new president, Nicolás Maduro, has revived a longtime scapegoat for the country's woes, accusing Washington of conspiring with other enemies of the government in waging an "economic war" that has subjected the populace to blackouts, chronic shortages and other ills. Borrowing from Mr. Chávez's script, Mr. Maduro on Monday expelled the top American diplomat here and two other embassy officials, contending that they were plotting to destabilize the country.
But while Mr. Chávez skillfully portrayed the United States as an imperialist bully and cast himself in the role of underdog hero, many Chávez supporters are finding Mr. Maduro's attempts to imitate his mentor unconvincing.
"This is the biggest mistake Chávez ever made," said Axel Ortiz, 20, a student, referring to Mr. Chávez's choice of Mr. Maduro as his successor. Mr. Ortiz still defines himself as a Chavista -- a loyal Chávez supporter -- but he questioned Mr. Maduro's ability to solve the nation's problems. "Chávez was the only one who was qualified, the only one who could keep things here under control."
The country's economic problems have become acute. Inflation in the first eight months of this year was more than triple the rate in the same period last year. When measured over the 12 months that ended in August, it exceeded 45 percent. A government indicator that measures the scarcity of basic goods is close to its highest level in more than five years.
Many stores allow customers to buy only a limited number of scarce items like corn flour and cooking oil. People complain of having to stand in line for hours, often in vain, and many are losing patience with the government's explanation that unsavory conspirators are to blame for the nation's problems.
"The government is resorting to more and more outrageous and extravagant actions and statements to control the agenda," said Andrés Cañizalez, a communications professor at Andrés Bello Catholic University.
All of this would be a lot to handle for any neophyte president, but the gaffe-prone Mr. Maduro has come under withering criticism for regularly tripping over his words, eliciting cringes from supporters and jeers from opponents. When he fell off his bicycle on live television recently, the event threatened to become a metaphor for a struggling presidency.
"People laugh at him," said María López, 32, a mother of two on a recent morning in the Terrazas del Alba slum in the center of Caracas. She voted for Mr. Maduro, and said she still supported him. But she fought back a smirk when asked about Mr. Maduro's bicycle accident, which occurred during a ride to promote his party's youth movement. "We don't want a president who's a joke," she said.
The blunders have piled up, much like the entourage of politicians and bodyguards who screeched to a halt in a tangle behind the president's fallen bicycle.
In one of his most infamous verbal flubs, in August, Mr. Maduro sought to make a reference to the biblical story of Jesus' multiplying the loaves and fishes -- only to have it come out of his mouth as "the multiplication of the penises." Mr. Maduro apparently conflated "peces" (fish) and "panes" (loaves) to produce "penes" (penises). He quickly apologized and corrected himself, but the damage was done.
"A person who doesn't know how to speak will never know how to run a country," said Jorge Flores, 30, a messenger at a government-run hospital, who voted for Mr. Maduro but now bitterly regrets doing so.
"This is the worst government I've ever seen," Mr. Flores said. "The best government we've ever had here was with Chávez."
Mr. Maduro calls his critics elitists and once said he had misspoken on purpose to bait his detractors.
Mr. Chávez, a fiery socialist, had a connection with ordinary Venezuelans that was so strong they often refused to blame him for many of the same problems that continue to bedevil the country. Mr. Maduro does not have the same charisma, and at least some of Mr. Chávez's followers seem to be tuning him out.
"The government does these things to distract us from our real problems," said Cristian Nivela, 24, a Chávez loyalist who voted for Mr. Maduro, referring to the expulsion of the American diplomats.
On Tuesday, Mr. Maduro used a special national television broadcast to present what he said was evidence that the diplomats had been conspiring with the extreme right in Venezuela to destabilize the country.
He showed a video, accompanied by ominous music, contending that the top diplomat at the United States Embassy, Kelly Keiderling, and the other two expelled diplomats had met in recent weeks with elected officials -- including a state governor and a mayor -- who belong to the Venezuelan opposition. The video also showed them leaving a meeting at the office of a pro-democracy group.
"These officials are meeting, well, in a shameless manner, and talking about strikes, sabotage, talking about the internal affairs of Venezuela, offering money," Mr. Maduro said.
Such accusations resonate here because of the United States' history of intervention in Latin America, including its tacit support of a 2002 coup that briefly ousted Mr. Chávez.
But a State Department official called the accusations absurd.
"Our diplomats were doing what they do all over the world," said the official, Roberta S. Jacobson, assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs. "They were visiting parts of the country and talking to all kinds of different people. They were doing nothing covert or out of the ordinary for diplomats."
She said that in response, the United States was expelling the top Venezuelan diplomat in Washington and two other Venezuelan Embassy officials. The United States and Venezuela do not maintain an ambassador in each other's capital.
On Tuesday night the State Department identified the Venenezuelan diplomats, who were given 48 hours to leave the country, as the charge d'affaires, Calixto Ortega Rios, and Second Secretary Monica Alejandra Sanchez Morales, both of whom are assigned to the country's embassy in Washington, and Marisol Gutierrez de Almeida, the consul in Houston,
"It is regrettable that the Venezuelan government has again decided to expel U.S. diplomatic officials based on groundless allegations, which require reciprocal action. the State Department said in a statement. "It is counterproductive to the interests of both our countries."
With the diplomatic tussle in the background, officials said the burglarized stadium -- home to the Caracas Lions and the La Guaira Sharks, roughly equivalent to the Yankees and Mets in Venezuelan baseball -- would be ready for the start of the season on Oct. 10.
They said workers had finally finished repairs to the lighting system after thieves stripped out much of the wiring, in a very public example of the crime, corruption and disarray in this country.
But the looting of the meat truck on Friday was shocking even to many who have become inured to the high levels of violence here. The truck became stuck under a barrier meant to block oversize vehicles. Part of the cargo crushed the top of the cab.
Denny Medina, 44, the owner of a fleet of trucks, said that he had tried to rescue the driver, but that he could not open the door. Instead of helping, he said, looters clambered over the vehicle.
"What made me feel powerless was to see the people carrying off the boxes of meat, and no one was showing any concern for the driver right below them," Mr. Medina said. "It was terrible. I hope that we don't get used to this."

Full text:   CARACAS, Venezuela -- Stepping up hostilities with the United States, President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela expelled the top American diplomat and two other embassy officials from the country on Monday, accusing them of supporting plots to sabotage the country's electrical grid and the economy.
"Get out of Venezuela! Yankee go home!" Mr. Maduro shouted as he announced the expulsions at a military event to commemorate the bicentennial of a battle in Venezuela's war of independence.
"We have detected a group of officials of the United States Embassy in Caracas, in Venezuela, and we have been tracking them for several months," Mr. Maduro said during a live television broadcast. "These officials spend their time meeting with the Venezuelan extreme right wing, financing them and encouraging them to take actions to sabotage the electrical system, to sabotage the Venezuelan economy."
The expulsions were the latest diplomatic swipe at Washington by Mr. Maduro since he took over for the country's longtime president, Hugo Chávez, who died in March. Late last year, as Mr. Chávez grew increasingly ill, the two nations held informal talks aimed at improving the long-strained relations between them, and there was some optimism on the American side that Mr. Maduro, a former foreign minister sometimes described as pragmatic, would be amenable to a thaw.
But it quickly became clear that Mr. Maduro intended to stick closely to Mr. Chávez's example, painting the United States as an imperialist aggressor out to undermine his government. Early on, he accused the Obama administration of plotting against him, and hours before he announced the death of Mr. Chávez on March 5, he kicked out two American military attachés, saying they had tried to recruit Venezuelan military personnel to conspire against the government.
The diplomats expelled on Monday included Kelly Keiderling, the chargé d'affaires, who runs the embassy in the absence of an ambassador here. The United States has not had an ambassador in Caracas since 2010, when Mr. Chávez refused to accept the new one proposed by Washington because of remarks that Mr. Chávez said were disrespectful.
Mr. Chávez had already expelled the American ambassador, Patrick Duddy, in 2008, saying that his government had discovered an American-supported plot by military officers to topple him. Mr. Duddy was later allowed to return to Caracas.
Another one of the diplomats expelled on Monday was Elizabeth Hoffman, an official in the embassy's political section, whom Mr. Maduro had publicly accused at least as early as April of meeting with opposition figures to plot sabotage of the electrical system. He said at the time that he had proof but took no action until Monday. The third official being expelled is David Moo, the vice consul.
Foreign Minister Elías Jaua later said on television that the evidence against the American diplomats included meetings held in recent weeks with democracy advocates, union members and elected officials belonging to the political opposition, whom he accused of planning to destabilize the country.
Mr. Maduro said the officials had 48 hours to leave the country.
"We completely reject the Venezuelan government's allegations of U.S. government involvement in any type of conspiracy to destabilize the Venezuelan government," the American Embassy said in a statement. It called the meetings held by the officials "normal diplomatic engagements," adding, "We maintain regular contacts across the Venezuelan political spectrum."
Ever since he was elected by a narrow margin in April in a special election to replace Mr. Chávez, Mr. Maduro has struggled with intense economic woes and a deeply divided populace. He has often accused plotters and saboteurs of being responsible for a variety of the nation's ills, including electrical blackouts and the deadly explosion at the national oil company's enormous Amuay refinery.
"He needs diversions and distractions," said Michael Shifter, president of the Inter-American Dialogue, a policy group in Washington. "The situation is so dire in Venezuela that he needs to find a scapegoat, and it's convenient and politically so tempting to kick out U.S. diplomats."
But Mr. Shifter said that describing the United States as the source of the country's problems might not have the same effect it did for Mr. Chávez, who was beloved by many of his supporters. Mr. Maduro does not inspire nearly the same devotion, and the country's economic woes are getting worse, with inflation over 45 percent a year and shortages of many basic foods and goods, including toilet paper.
"I doubt that it has the resonance it used to have," Mr. Shifter said of the diplomatic expulsions.

Full text:   THE Federal Reserve confounded the bond markets last month by clinging to its easy-money policies. The federal government is poised to shut down today because of an impasse over the budget. And in two weeks, the nation is set to hit its borrowing limit.
These are the headlines, and they're dire, but they're in fact a sideshow compared with the real problems afflicting our economy. We are in an age of global oversupply: an oversupply of global labor (hence high underemployment); an oversupply of global productive capacity (hence ultra-low inflation); and an oversupply of global capital (hence low interest rates).
This explains why, around the middle of each of the past three years, activity petered out after predictions earlier in the year that the economy would finally achieve escape velocity.
The jobs created have been mainly low wage and part time. Growth in domestic manufacturing is still slow, and business spending has fallen, though corporations are flush with profits. Debt-saddled households continue to see real incomes deteriorate (even with very low inflation). Sales of new homes have suddenly reversed course. Rents are falling in several markets where home prices have recently increased. Even the seemingly unflappable stock market has been seesawing because of the uncertain economic signals.
Why do we seem unable to get out of this rut? In short, our policy makers are still fighting the last war. We are no longer faced with a world in which supply-side economic remedies -- easy money, reduced taxation, fiscal belt-tightening and deregulation -- can spur new capacity and the creation of well-paying private sector jobs.
A "reverse supply shock" that resulted from the sudden emergence, especially in the 1990s, of the productive potential of enormous, previously walled-off populations from Eastern Europe to Latin America to East and South Asia, helped fuel successive bubbles.
Hundreds of millions of people who once lived in sleepy or sclerotic statist and socialist economies now compete directly or indirectly with workers in the United States, Europe and Japan, in a world bound by lightning-fast communications and transportation. Countries that were recently poor (and still are, on a per-capita basis) find themselves with huge surpluses and sovereign wealth funds. The rich countries of the world, while still rich, struggle with monumental levels of debt, both private and public, and unsettling questions about whether they can compete globally.
Beginning in the late 1990s, a wave of capital, much of it the result of trade surpluses and big piles of savings in Asia, flooded the world's capital markets. But consideration of global imbalances has taken a back seat in domestic policy circles. The causes of the crisis, it is often said in New York and Washington, lay mainly in too much risk-taking by the lords of finance, along with too big an appetite for debt among ordinary people.
But one can't properly understand the financial crisis without appreciating how the rise of the emerging nations distorted the economies of rich countries. And you can't chart a course to more growth and stability in the developed world without recognizing that many of these distorting forces are still at work. Cheaper credit through monetary easing, for example, doesn't yield much in an era when cheap capital already exists in abundance.
Can we get out of this mess? We can, but we need a fresh playbook.
Developed nations need to put the huge surplus of underemployed workers back to work by any means, including big public sector investments to improve infrastructure and competitiveness. We need a new economic multilateralism with the developing world, to encourage them to rebalance their economics away from savings and toward consumption, while we in the West must curb our addiction to credit and consumption (and in doing so reverse the trends of income and wealth polarization).
Financial institutions that engage in speculation instead of capital formation create waste that we can no longer afford. Health care and higher education, fields known for both excellence and waste, and giant discrepancies in quality, must yield to more cost-effective approaches (and become more accessible).
Above all, we must end the ideological gridlock that stands in the way of renewed prosperity. Frenzied, supply-side insistence on allowing markets to work matters out, and diatribes against government-led economic activities may please right-wing political constituencies. But simply ignoring the earnest fortitude of billions of new global workers is no way for this nation to stay rich and competitive.

Full text:   MINNEAPOLIS -- It was past quitting time at a new textile factory here, but that was not the only reason the work floor looked so desolate. Under the high ceilings, the fluorescent lights still bright, there were just 15 or so industrial sewing machines in a sprawling space meant for triple that amount.
The issue wasn't poor demand for the curtains, pillows and other textiles being produced at the factory. Quite the opposite. The owner, the Airtex Design Group, had shifted an increasing amount of its production here from China because customers had been asking for more American-made goods.
The issue was finding workers.
"The sad truth is, we put ads in the paper and not many people show up," said Mike Miller, Airtex's chief executive.
The American textile and apparel industries, like manufacturing as a whole, are experiencing a nascent turnaround as apparel and textile companies demand higher quality, more reliable scheduling and fewer safety problems than they encounter overseas. Accidents like the factory collapse in Bangladesh earlier this year, which killed more than 1,000 workers, have reinforced the push for domestic production.
But because the industries were decimated over the last two decades -- 77 percent of the American work force has been lost since 1990 as companies moved jobs abroad -- manufacturers are now scrambling to find workers to fill the specialized jobs that have not been taken over by machines.
Wages for cut-and-sew jobs, the core of the apparel industry's remaining work force, have been rising fast -- increasing 13.2 percent on an inflation-adjusted basis from 2007 to 2012, while overall private sector pay rose just 1.4 percent. Companies here in Minnesota are so hungry for workers that they posted five job openings for every student in a new training program in industrial sewing, a full month before the training was even completed.
"It withered away and nobody noticed," Jen Guarino, a former chief executive of the leather-goods maker J. W. Hulme, said of the skilled sewing work force. "Businesses stopped investing in training; they stopped investing in equipment."
Like manufacturers in many parts of the country, those in Minnesota are wrestling with how to attract a new generation of factory workers while also protecting their bottom lines in an industry where pennies per garment can make or break a business. The backbone of the new wave of manufacturing in the United States has been automation, but some tasks still require human hands.
Nationally, manufacturers have created recruitment centers that use touch screens and other interactive technology to promote the benefits of textile and apparel work.
Here, they are recruiting at high schools, papering churches and community centers with job postings, and running ads in Hmong, Somali and Spanish-language newspapers. And in a moment of near desperation last year -- after several companies worried about turning down orders because they did not have the manpower to handle them -- Minnesota manufacturers hatched their grandest rescue effort of all: a program to create a skilled work force from scratch.
Run by a coalition of manufacturers, a nonprofit organization and a technical college, the program runs for six months, two or three nights a week, and teaches novices how to be industrial sewers, from handling a sewing machine to working with vinyl and canvas.
Eighteen students, ranging from a 22-year-old taking a break from college to a 60-year-old former janitor who had been out of work for three months, enrolled in the inaugural session that ended in June. The $3,695 tuition was covered by charities and the city of Minneapolis, though students will largely be expected to pay for future courses themselves.
After the course, the companies, which pay to belong to the coalition, sponsored students for a three-week rotation on their factory floors and a two-week internship at minimum wage. Then the free-for-all began as the members competed to hire those graduates who decide to pursue a career in industrial sewing.
"We need to think practically about getting skilled labor," said Ms. Guarino, a founder of the training effort, known as the Makers Coalition. "The growth is there but we're going to be in trouble if we don't have a pool to draw from."
Last year, there were about 142,000 people employed as sewing machine operators in the United States, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In the Minneapolis-St. Paul metro area, which had almost 1.75 million workers last year -- and where the unemployment rate as of July was 4.9 percent -- only 860 were employed in 2012 as machine sewers..
Airtex had room for 50 of them. "We are looking for new sewers every day," said Mr. Miller, the Airtex executive.
Wooing Immigrant Workers
Airtex's roots in Minneapolis date to 1918, when Mr. Miller's grandfather started the Sam Miller Bag Company, specializing in potato and feed bags. In the 1980s, Susan Shields founded a baggage company, and the two combined in 2000 as the Airtex Design Group, producing home textiles for companies like Pottery Barn and Restoration Hardware.
Soon after the merger, the company began producing in China, first in the Dongguan area, then Wuxi and Shanghai. Today, it still employs about 100 Chinese workers through a partner factory in Dongguan, but production there is no longer the bargain it once was, said Ms. Shields, Airtex's president.
Initially Airtex paid $3 an hour on average for its Chinese workers; now, it pays about $11.80 an hour, including benefits and housing.
Its American factory-floor workers make about $9 to $17 an hour, though Airtex estimates benefits add another 30 percent to those figures.
As costs were rising in China, Airtex was also getting a new message from some of its clients: They wanted more American-made products.
Health care clients wanted medical slings and other sensitive medical products made domestically to ensure quality. Retailers did not want to pay overseas freight costs to import bulky items like pillows, and they wanted more flexibility in turning around designs quickly. As Airtex considered production in Vietnam and elsewhere, it became concerned about safety and quality issues -- and increasingly interested in the American alternative.
"The opportunity for domestic business right now is unbelievable," Ms. Shields said. "Either we start to bring it back here, more of it, or we start going to places that are marginally unsafe."
But the lack of workers here in Minnesota made shifting business back home frustrating.
It had gotten to the point where new business sometimes felt like a headache, not an opportunity. As Mr. Miller was headed to Chicago for a sales pitch in February, for instance, he was more worried than excited about landing a new contract.
"What concerns me is, if I get it," he said, "where are we going to find the people?"
In the various waves of American textile production, dating to the 1800s, the problem of an available and willing work force solved itself.
Little capital was required -- the boss just needed sewing equipment and people willing to work. That made it an attractive business for newly arrived immigrants with a few dollars to their name and, often, some background in garment work. Typically, the mostly male factory owners would recruit female workers from their old countries for the grunt work.
From the 1840s until the Civil War, it was new arrivals from Ireland and Germany. From the 1880s through the 1920s, it was Russian Jews and Italians, who would buy newly mass-produced Singer sewing machines and often set up shops in their tenement apartments with wives, daughters and tenants making up the initial work force, said Daniel Katz, provost of the National Labor College and author of a book about the garment industry.
Puerto Ricans, who were given citizenship on the eve of American entry into World War I, and black migrants from the South rounded out the work force until the 1960s, when Chinese and Dominican laborers took over, Mr. Katz said.
In San Francisco and New York, a small number of Chinese women came to the United States despite the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882 barring Chinese laborers, making up a base of garment workers. After 1965, when immigration restrictions eased and Chinese were allowed to join family members, greater numbers of women came and that pool of workers grew.
"It was pretty well known that basically the day after you landed, you'd be taken to a factory by a relative to learn how to use an industrial sewing machine," said Katie Quan, associate chair of the Labor Center at the University of California, Berkeley. In Los Angeles, Latinos made up much of the work force. And in the Carolinas, Hmong immigrants filled textile manufacturing jobs well into the 1990s, halting -- or at least delaying -- the migration of jobs overseas, said Rachel Willis, an American studies professor at the University of North Carolina.
Now, here in Minnesota, immigrants are once again being seen as the new hope.
Wanted: English and Math
Last fall, Lifetrack, a nonprofit group in St. Paul that helps immigrants, people on welfare and those with disabilities, began screening clients for possible admission to the sewing training program. Inside a gray-green room in a building on the edge of a four-lane road, people gathered around three tables: Burmese women at one of them, Ethiopian men at another, and at the back of the room an African-American woman, then 61, and a white man, 60, both born in America.
The first task was for students to test their English and math proficiency. Language skills are essential so workers can communicate with their bosses, but math skills are just as important in textile work because sewing requires precise measurements. As the students worked on the proficiency tests, Tatjana Hutnyak, Lifetrack's director of business development, went over the basics.
Starting wages: $12 and $16 an hour. Transportation: The college, Dunwoody College of Technology, is on a bus line, but if students interview with a company not on a bus line, Lifetrack will help them get there. After passing career-readiness tests, students could qualify for the course, which would give them a certificate in industrial sewing -- and, ideally, a job.
"They want to have a career rather than packaging, assembling, cleaning jobs," said a Lifetrack manager, Dagim Gemeda, explaining why clients were interested in the sewing certification.
The Burmese women had come to Minnesota after spending time in refugee camps in Thailand. Paw Done had done piece work, sewing at home while she watched her children. The others had little sewing experience.
The Ethiopian men, who ranged in age from 21 to 42, had been in this country several years. A couple were students, one was a former custodian who had moved from another state to be close to his college-bound son, and a fourth, Abdulhakim Tahiro, had been laid off from his job at an airport car rental kiosk.
"It's good, for my level it's good," Mr. Tahiro said of the starting wages.
Mr. Tahiro and Ms. Done enrolled in the course that started last January, when about half of the class were immigrants. Another student in the course, Patricia Ramon, 56, was an entrepreneur in Mexico with sewing experience. Ms. Ramon already had a job as a sewer at J. W. Hulme, but quit to take the course with the goal of obtaining certification. She wanted proof, she said, that she had technical skills.
"I am not like an old-time seamstress," Ms. Ramon said. She expects to sew as a career, and said that making $16 an hour with health insurance would be enough to live on.
The students who were not immigrants often had difficult work histories or other problems. One of them was Lawrence Corbesia, the man sitting at the back table during the screening session. He was a former machine operator and custodial worker who had been looking for work for three months.
Another was Edward Johnson, 44, who was homeless when the course started. After food service and call-center jobs, he went to prison for felony assault, and had a tough time finding a job when he got out in 2009. He moved to Wisconsin to pick fruit, moved back to Minneapolis because he hated picking fruit, and was living on the streets and selling watercolor paintings when a homeless-center counselor hooked him up with the sewing program.
Until now, the only sewing experience Mr. Johnson had was sewing on buttons -- a punishment meted out by his mother when he misbehaved. To save money, Mr. Johnson walked the 45 minutes to and from the college.
The program was overwhelming at first, he said, "so frustrating that sometimes I'd go home crying." But he spent days at the library, watching YouTube videos on sewing techniques and studying terms used by the industry. By the end, it had gotten easier, he said, making pajamas, tote bags and aprons.
So many people are on government assistance, he said. "I'd rather learn a trade and go to work -- and work," he said.
A Long-Term Solution
Manufacturers elsewhere are also trying to build a new labor pool.
In a former glove factory in Conover, N.C., the Manufacturing Solutions Center has touch screens showing the technologies that textile manufacturers use today, while new machines spool out printed fabric. In Pennsylvania, a work force investment board has started a program with plant tours, YouTube videos of workers and a Web site promising that "contrary to popular opinion, many good jobs in manufacturing are still available."
Other industry groups have created a curriculum for high schools on manufacturing, including Manufacturing Day, with factory tours for school groups.
Still the difficulty attracting young people frustrates Debra Kerrigan, a dean at Dunwoody overseeing the Minnesota program.
"I think it's just the idea of, 'Oh, I'm a sewer,' that doesn't thrill the average young individual today," she said. "Skills for a lot of different industries are coming back now, machinists and automotive workers and sewers. I think if you have a skill when the economy gets bad, you're more likely to succeed than someone who doesn't."
Compared with the other courses Dunwoody offers -- graphic design, Web programming, robotics -- sewing can seem a little old school, students say. But Elizabeth Huber, 22, who took a break from the University of Minnesota to take the sewing course, said that can also be a selling point.
"I like getting back to making things, to touching and manipulating materials rather than just pushing buttons or tweeting all day," she said.
As the sewing course drew to a close, members of the Makers Coalition were jostling for the 18 graduates. Don Boothroyd at Kellé, a firm that makes dance costumes, hoped to snag 10 of them. J. W. Hulme wanted five, and was considering covering a student's tuition for another course exchange for a contract promising that the student would work at Hulme for one year. Airtex hoped for five to 10 students.
But only nine students completed the course -- many dropped out for personal reasons, or decided they just weren't interested in the work -- and eight got jobs. The coalition is now revamping the curriculum to focus more on hands-on work and machine maintenance.
Airtex decided it could not afford to wait for the coalition's training program to work out its kinks. So, as the course proceeded, Airtex redoubled its efforts to find people who had some background in sewing. Mr. Miller and Ms. Shields offered a bonus to existing employees who brought in friends. They hosted an open house for prospective workers, and tried to think of groups they had not approached before -- like a nonprofit that works with people with disabilities.
"I had a guy driving me to the airport the other day," Mr. Miller said, "and he mentioned he knows a lot of people in the Cambodian community and I should call his pastor."
Finally, Airtex decided it had to pay for training itself, even if that meant the company was less profitable for a while. It trains workers for a few hours a week, with a technical-college instructor and existing employees instructing new ones on topics like ergonomics and handling tricky materials. Airtex has since made 10 new hires for floor jobs, none of whom were highly experienced.
"The reality is, if we want good workers we know we have to train them and bring them in ourselves," Ms. Shields said.
The factory floor now seems less barren because there are 25 sewing stations (there is still room for another 25). And most significantly, the additional workers mean the company can take on new work: Airtex has tripled its capacity, and is now making about 70 percent of its products in the United States.

Full text:   HOME prices have been rising rapidly, so much so that there is talk that we are entering another national bubble.
In fact, according to the S.& P./Case-Shiller Composite-10 Home Price Index, which Karl Case of Wellesley College and I developed, home prices in the United States were up 18.4 percent in real, inflation-corrected terms in the 16 months that ended in July. During the housing bubble that preceded the 2008 financial crisis, the largest 16-month increase wasn't much bigger: 22.7 percent, for the period ended in July 2004.
Is it possible that we are lapsing into what I call a bubble mentality -- a self-reinforcing cycle of popular belief that prices can only go higher?
Some answers arise from a study that Professor Case and I have been conducting since 2003. Under the auspices of the Yale School of Management, we've been sending out annual questionnaires to random samples of recent home buyers in four United States cities: Boston, Milwaukee, Los Angeles and San Francisco. Last year, we reported on our project at the Brookings Institution in a paper we wrote with Anne Thompson of McGraw-Hill Construction.
We updated the survey in May and June. The results suggest that though we are not in a bubble now, there are troubling signs that we may be heading toward one.
Out of 2,000 questionnaires sent to home buyers, we received 368 responses. We asked the respondents how much they thought home prices would rise both in the next year and in the longer term -- each of the next 10 years.
The short-term expectations were somewhat high, with respondents saying they anticipated a 5.7 percent increase, on average, in the next year. (That's close to the implied home price appreciation of 5.6 percent in the home price futures market at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.)
These projections were much higher than those in 2011, when respondents anticipated only a 1.6 percent increase, and somewhat above those of 2012, when the expectation was 4.0 percent. Still, in 2004, just before the peak in home prices, short-term expectations were far loftier, at 8.7 percent.
What's more, long-term expectations in the current survey remained relatively modest, at 4.2 percent a year for the next 10 years. At that rate, if consumer inflation is modest, at, say, 2 percent a year, real prices would rise only about 2.2 percent annually, and we wouldn't return to the December 2005 peak in real home prices until 2031.
We also posed this question in the survey: "Do you agree with the following statement: Real estate is the best investment for long-term holders, who can just buy and hold through the ups and downs of the market." In 2004, some 84.2 percent of respondents agreed. But the percentage has been generally declining ever since, bottoming last year at 66.5 percent. While that level may still seem high, we should remember that these are people who have just bought a home. (The level was up a little in 2013, to 70.4 percent.)
Here's another indication that we are not now in bubble territory: Some 10.6 percent of respondents said they bought a home "only to rent out to others." That proportion has been rising irregularly since 2004, when it was just 2.7 percent. The change likely reflects the recent tilt in demand toward rental housing, which isn't likely to sustain high prices in scattered suburban housing.
The questionnaire invited readers to respond in their own words to questions like these:
"Was there any event or events in the last two years that you think changed the trend in home prices?"
"What do you think explains recent changes in housing prices in [name of respondent's city]? What ultimately is behind what is going on?"
When we asked these questions near the height of the bubble in 2004, especially in the booming markets like Los Angeles and San Francisco, home buyers tended to use terms that suggested bubble thinking -- phrases like "limited land," "high demand for housing," "population growth," "everyone wants to be here" and "buyers willing to pay any asking price." There was also much talk about low interest rates, and how they might soon rise, even though the 30-year mortgage rate, then at just over 6 percent, was much higher than the current level of about 4.5 percent.
In this year's survey, the answers didn't suggest a bubble mentality, though the theme of temporarily low interest rates remained. In summary, Americans are still relatively sober about housing. They aren't showing "irrational exuberance" about home investing to the degree they did in the past, at least not yet.
But neither are they being completely realistic. In reading the most recent answers, I see no signs that home buyers have learned the lesson I tried to convey in the second edition of my book "Irrational Exuberance" in 2005. That message was that existing-home prices have shown virtually no tendency to trend upward in real, inflation-corrected terms over the last century. While land is limited, it's only a small component of home value in most places. New construction often brings down the value of older homes, which wear out and go out of fashion, dragging down prices.
IT'S as if people are applying to housing an idea described by Frederick Lewis Allen in his 1931 book, "Only Yesterday." Before the stock market collapsed in 1929, he said, people thought that "every crash of the past few years had been followed by a recovery, and that every recovery had ultimately brought prices to a new high point. Two steps up, one step down, two steps up again -- that was how the market went."
Well, people have certainly been right that there will always be steps up and down. Unfortunately, there is no certainty that the ups will outnumber the downs.
People who are now inclined to buy a home are most often just thinking that we are gradually recovering from a recession and that this is a good time to buy. The mental framing still seems to be about economic recovery and the likelihood that interest rates will rise. People mostly don't seem to be prompted by the anticipation of another housing boom.
That's the thinking at the moment. But whether these attitudes mutate into a national epidemic of bubble thinking -- one big enough to outweigh higher mortgage rates, fiscal austerity in Congress and other factors -- remains to be seen.

Full text:   CINCINNATI -- Although the new federal health care law is designed to help people buying individual policies, even people with employer-provided policies are beginning to see changes in their coverage as companies rethink health care for their workers, discontinuing it in a few cases and redesigning it in many others.
They are motivated by a need to rein in health care costs, which continue to rise faster than overall inflation, but the federal health care law is also changing how some view their obligations to their employees.
Some major firms, like Walgreen, the drugstore chain, are giving those who qualify money to buy insurance on a private health exchange. Aon Hewitt, a benefits consultant that will oversee health plans on Walgreen's behalf, said 18 large employers had signed up so far, including Sears and Darden Restaurants.
But here in Cincinnati, General Electric is taking the opposite approach.
One of the largest employers in the nation, it spends more than $2 billion a year offering coverage to 500,000 employees and retirees and their families. And it is using its considerable clout in places like this -- where its giant aviation business gives it a major presence -- to work directly with doctors and hospitals to improve care and reduce costs.
"I don't know anybody who isn't trying almost everything," said Helen Darling, president of the National Business Group on Health, which represents employers providing benefits. "We're going to see a lot of activity in the next couple of years."
Over the last few years, G.E. has pushed for the creation of so-called medical homes, in which an individual medical practice closely coordinates a patient's care by having access to all of the patient's medical records.
In Cincinnati, about 118 doctors' practices have converted to medical homes, and all five of the major health systems are making their primary care practices move in that direction. G.E. has also pushed for greater transparency of results.
"If we don't take accountability ourselves for figuring this out, we're part of the problem," said Sue Siegel, a senior executive at G.E., who sees transformation of health care both as a business opportunity and a business necessity.
"We have to be involved in the solution," she said. "We can't just wait for someone to tell us that it is going to be fixed."
What distinguishes the effort by G.E. is its direct focus on hospitals and doctors. Companies looking to the private exchanges are largely hoping to save money and want to be freed from the headache of administering health benefits.
In Walgreen's case, the company says it doesn't plan to lower its share of its workers' health care costs but hopes to foster more competition among insurers, leading to better prices and more choice for employees.
In Cincinnati, G.E. took on both a cheerleading and coordinating role. In early 2010, Jeffrey R. Immelt, its chief executive, addressed local business leaders and urged them to think strategically and align their efforts to make more of a difference. There were already significant efforts under way to foster medical homes, for example, and G.E. pushed to find more financing to expand the concept to more medical practices and keep the focus on that initiative.
"The ever-present vigilance of the employers help nudge things along," said Craig Brammer, chief executive of three area health care coalitions, including the Greater Cincinnati Health Council, which is made up of the area's hospitals, health plans and employers.
The city's health systems say they recognize that insurers and employers are increasingly going to reward them for better tracking their patients in and out of the hospital. "We are clearly gearing up to change directions from fee for service for what I'll call payment for value," said Will Groneman, an executive vice president for TriHealth, one of the systems.
The medical home also appears to resonate with employees. When Mary Farris, a 44-year-old marketing executive for G.E., found herself going to a local urgent care center because she could never get an appointment with her physician, she switched to a practice that had become a medical home.
What strikes Ms. Farris was how much time the doctor and medical assistant spent gathering her medical history and making sure there weren't additional medical issues. While she came in for a spider bite, the focus was on her well-being as a working mother whose father was seriously ill at the time. "The picture was more on all of me as opposed to one isolated incident," she said. "Somebody was trying to connect the dots."
In Cincinnati, there are beginning to be grudging signs of success. Early results are promising: patients enrolled in medical homes had 3.5 percent fewer visits to the emergency room and 14 percent fewer hospital admissions over the four years from 2008 through 2012. G.E. plans to ask an outside firm to do a more detailed analysis.
But employers looking to adapt a similar strategy will find "it's hard to do," said David Lansky, the chief executive of the Pacific Business Group on Health, which represents West Coast employers. While "the opportunity is significant," he said, companies may not have the time or resources to work in too many of their locations, with different hospitals and health plans in each market.
Some companies -- Trader Joe's for example -- decided to send at least some employees to the new public exchanges. Trader Joe's has left coverage for three-quarters of its work force untouched but is giving part-time workers a contribution of $500 to buy policies in the newly created state marketplaces. Because of the employees' low incomes, the company says it believes many will be eligible for federal subsidies to help them afford coverage.
But a few major employers are taking even more aggressive stances and are trying to reshape how health care is delivered in this country.
They are increasingly looking to make direct connections with health systems, particularly well-regarded institutions that can deliver good care for what can be very expensive back or heart problems. G.E. recently signed an agreement with Hospital for Special Surgery in New York, a high-volume orthopedic hospital, to oversee the care of some employees getting hip and knee replacements. Last year, Walmart contracted with health systems like the Cleveland Clinic, Mayo and Geisinger, among others, to take care of employees who need transplants, heart and spine care. The company says it will soon expand the program to other centers of excellence.
The decision doesn't always sit well with the home team. In Cincinnati, the UC Health System, which includes an academic medical center that also serves the area's major source of care for the uninsured, says it would welcome a similar opportunity to provide joint replacements for G.E., but executives say they simply cannot afford to offer significant discounts. "We don't have the resources to cut deals," said Dr. Myles Pensak, an executive for UC Health.
G.E. is unapologetic. The company says it will continue to try a variety of approaches until it finds a way to tame health care costs even more than the annual growth rate achieved so far of under 3 percent. "You'll see many, many experiments across the board," Ms. Seigel said.

Abstract: "There was still an ability within each institute to make adjustments, but, as N.I.H. director, I could not decide to emphasize cancer research and down modulate something else," Collins explained. Because of the sequester and the fact that the N.I.H. budget has been losing ground to inflation for 10 years, "we will not be able to fund 640 research grants that were scored in the top 17 percent of the proposals we received," said Collins.

Full text:   Countries that don't plan for the future tend not to do well there. When you watch the reckless behavior of the Tea Party-driven Republicans in Congress today, you can't help but fear that we'll be one of those. What makes it all the more frustrating is that in so many ways we have the wind at our back, if only we'd pull together to take advantage of it.
In a world that rewards imagination, we have an incredible melting pot of immigrants that constantly blends together new ideas from technology to commerce to the arts. In a world where secure, clean energy is a huge asset, our investments in efficiency and discoveries of natural gas, if properly exploited, have the potential to pull manufacturing back to America from all corners of the globe. In a world where the big divide is no longer between developed and developing countries but rather between high-imagination-enabling countries and low-imagination-enabling countries, we remain the highest-imagination-enabling country in the world -- and we have the innovative companies, start-ups and venture capitalists to prove it. In a world where so many countries are struggling with diversity, we do so as well, but at least we've reached a point where we could twice elect a black man for president, whose middle name is Hussein, who defeated a woman in his own party and then four years later a Mormon from the other. No one else does that.
A country with this many natural assets should be celebrating, and instead we're inflicting wounds on ourselves. The gerrymandered hyperpartisanship that has infected both parties since the end of the cold war is debilitating enough, but the latest iteration is a new low. The Republican Party is being taken over by a Tea Party faction that is not interested in governing on any of the big issues -- immigration, gun control, health care, debt and taxes -- where, with just minimal compromises between the two parties, we'd amplify our strengths so much that we'd separate ourselves from the rest of the world. Instead, this group is threatening to shut down the government and undermine America's vital credit rating if it doesn't get its way.
This kind of madness helped to produce the idiotic sequester -- the $1.2 trillion in automatic, arbitrary and across-the-board budget cuts from 2013 to 2021 -- that is already undermining one of our strongest assets.
Ask Dr. Francis Collins, the director of the National Institutes of Health, the crown jewel of American biotech innovation. In fiscal 2013, the sequester required the N.I.H. to cut $1.55 billion across the board: 5 percent at each of its 27 institutes and centers, irrespective of whether one was on the cusp of a medical breakthrough and another was not. "There was still an ability within each institute to make adjustments, but, as N.I.H. director, I could not decide to emphasize cancer research and down modulate something else," Collins explained.
Because of the sequester and the fact that the N.I.H. budget has been losing ground to inflation for 10 years, "we will not be able to fund 640 research grants that were scored in the top 17 percent of the proposals we received," said Collins. "They would have been funded without the sequester, but now they won't. They include new ideas on cancer, diabetes, autism and heart disease -- all the things that we as a country say are a high priority. I can't say which of those grants would have led to the next breakthrough, or which investigator would be a Nobel Prize winner 20 years from now."
Of those 640 top research proposals, 150 were from scientists financed in a previous budget cycle who had returned to the N.I.H. to secure another three to five years of funding -- because they thought they were really onto something and a peer review board agreed. "Now we are cutting them off," said Collins, "so you damage the previous investment as well as the future one."
In 2014, the N.I.H. was planning to offer new money to stimulate research proposals in a dozen areas, including how to speed up the use of stem cells to cure Parkinson's and other diseases, how to better manage pain in sickle-cell disease and how to improve early diagnosis of autism. All were shelved because of the sequester, said Collins: "Why ask people to submit applications we would just have to turn down?"
In addition, in 2013, the N.I.H. had to turn away from its research hospital 750 patients who wanted to be part of clinical trials for disorders for which medicine currently has no answers. America's biomedical ecosystem depends heavily on the N.I.H. doing basic research the private sector won't do. So we're cutting the medical research that has the potential to prevent and cure the very diseases that are driving health care costs upward.
In short, we're cutting without a plan -- the worst thing a country or company can do -- and we're doing it because one of our two parties has been taken over by angry radicals and barking fools and the old leadership is running scared. I have plenty of issues with Democrats. They are not blameless for our paralysis. But when the Republican Party goes this far off the rails, it isn't even remotely challenging President Obama to challenge his base on taxes and entitlements.
And thus does a great country, with so much potential, slowly become ungreat.

Full text:   Global financing to fight AIDS has remained essentially flat since the 2008 financial crisis, according to a report by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the United Nations AIDS-fighting agency. About $7.9 billion from donors went to poor and middle-income countries last year. The amount has grown slowly after inflation for the past four years. Spending soared from 2002 to 2008 with the creation of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Malaria and Tuberculosis and the Bush administration's President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. The United States contributes almost 64 percent of the money. Britain gives 10 percent, France 5 percent, Germany 4 percent and Japan 3 percent. Measured as a percentage of gross national product, Denmark is the largest donor. Speeding up the disbursement of previously approved money increased the American contribution in 2012 to $5 billion from $4.5 billion. The report was released as world leaders met at the United Nations to review progress on fighting poverty and disease.

Full text:   The word "freedom" looms large in modern conservative rhetoric. Lobbying groups are given names like FreedomWorks; health reform is denounced not just for its cost but as an assault on, yes, freedom. Oh, and remember when we were supposed to refer to pommes frites as "freedom fries"?
The right's definition of freedom, however, isn't one that, say, F.D.R. would recognize. In particular, the third of his famous Four Freedoms -- freedom from want -- seems to have been turned on its head. Conservatives seem, in particular, to believe that freedom's just another word for not enough to eat.
Hence the war on food stamps, which House Republicans have just voted to cut sharply even while voting to increase farm subsidies.
In a way, you can see why the food stamp program -- or, to use its proper name, the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP) -- has become a target. Conservatives are deeply committed to the view that the size of government has exploded under President Obama but face the awkward fact that public employment is down sharply, while overall spending has been falling fast as a share of G.D.P. SNAP, however, really has grown a lot, with enrollment rising from 26 million Americans in 2007 to almost 48 million now.
Conservatives look at this and see what, to their great disappointment, they can't find elsewhere in the data: runaway, explosive growth in a government program. The rest of us, however, see a safety-net program doing exactly what it's supposed to do: help more people in a time of widespread economic distress.
The recent growth of SNAP has indeed been unusual, but then so have the times, in the worst possible way. The Great Recession of 2007-9 was the worst slump since the Great Depression, and the recovery that followed has been very weak. Multiple careful economic studies have shown that the economic downturn explains the great bulk of the increase in food stamp use. And while the economic news has been generally bad, one piece of good news is that food stamps have at least mitigated the hardship, keeping millions of Americans out of poverty.
Nor is that the program's only benefit. The evidence is now overwhelming that spending cuts in a depressed economy deepen the slump, yet government spending has been falling anyway. SNAP, however, is one program that has been expanding, and as such it has indirectly helped save hundreds of thousands of jobs.
But, say the usual suspects, the recession ended in 2009. Why hasn't recovery brought the SNAP rolls down? The answer is, while the recession did indeed officially end in 2009, what we've had since then is a recovery of, by and for a small number of people at the top of the income distribution, with none of the gains trickling down to the less fortunate. Adjusted for inflation, the income of the top 1 percent rose 31 percent from 2009 to 2012, but the real income of the bottom 40 percent actually fell 6 percent. Why should food stamp usage have gone down?
Still, is SNAP in general a good idea? Or is it, as Paul Ryan, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, puts it, an example of turning the safety net into "a hammock that lulls able-bodied people to lives of dependency and complacency."
One answer is, some hammock: last year, average food stamp benefits were $4.45 a day. Also, about those "able-bodied people": almost two-thirds of SNAP beneficiaries are children, the elderly or the disabled, and most of the rest are adults with children.
Beyond that, however, you might think that ensuring adequate nutrition for children, which is a large part of what SNAP does, actually makes it less, not more likely that those children will be poor and need public assistance when they grow up. And that's what the evidence shows. The economists Hilary Hoynes and Diane Whitmore Schanzenbach have studied the impact of the food stamp program in the 1960s and 1970s, when it was gradually rolled out across the country. They found that children who received early assistance grew up, on average, to be healthier and more productive adults than those who didn't -- and they were also, it turns out, less likely to turn to the safety net for help.
SNAP, in short, is public policy at its best. It not only helps those in need; it helps them help themselves. And it has done yeoman work in the economic crisis, mitigating suffering and protecting jobs at a time when all too many policy makers seem determined to do the opposite. So it tells you something that conservatives have singled out this of all programs for special ire.
Even some conservative pundits worry that the war on food stamps, especially combined with the vote to increase farm subsidies, is bad for the G.O.P., because it makes Republicans look like meanspirited class warriors. Indeed it does. And that's because they are.

Abstract: Reversing part of that increase now "will provide a boost to growth, reduce the financing distortions that are emerging in the market, and reduce the strain on corporate and bank balance sheets," Raghuram Rajan, the new governor, said Friday at his first news conference on monetary policy.

Full text:   JAKARTA -- Indonesia and India, the two emerging markets hardest hit in recent weeks by falling currencies and other financial troubles, took opposite tracks on Friday as both countries struggled to balance growth with the threat of inflation.
In an interview here, the vice president of Indonesia characterized higher interest rates and a weakened currency as the "new normal." Boediono, the country's vice president, who uses only one name, said that Indonesia would face a tougher international financial environment in the coming months and should give greater emphasis to a stable currency, stable prices and a stable trade balance and not just pursue economic growth.
"We have been addicted, so to speak, with an easy-money environment for four years," said Mr. Boediono, the main architect of Indonesian economic policy since the Asian financial crisis in 1997 and 1998. "We know that we have to make some adjustments, and maybe by next year, we have to really, fully adjust to a new normal, so to speak, where easy money is no longer" available.
But in Mumbai, the new governor of the Reserve Bank of India suggested that India faced less of an international threat after the Federal Reserve decided on Wednesday to continue its economic stimulus, at least temporarily. The governor, Raghuram Rajan, lowered a key interest rate on Friday by three-quarters of a percent, although he raised another less important rate by a quarter of a percent.
India pushed interest rates up sharply over the summer to make financial investments there more attractive and slow the fall of the rupee. Reversing part of that increase now "will provide a boost to growth, reduce the financing distortions that are emerging in the market, and reduce the strain on corporate and bank balance sheets," Raghuram Rajan, the new governor, said Friday at his first news conference on monetary policy.
In monetary terms, India is zigging while Indonesia is zagging, despite the many common challenges that have pummeled their currencies and stock markets in recent weeks. Both must balance a need to preserve economic growth for large, heavily poor populations, while at the same time preventing a buildup of inflation that might discourage longer-term investments -- a tricky balancing act that has bedeviled policy makers in the United States and other affluent countries over the years.
India, with a population of about 1.2 billion, and Indonesia, population 250 million, are both struggling to modernize their infrastructure while stuck with complex land ownership laws that make it hard to redevelop cities rapidly. Both are wrestling with costly but politically popular fuel subsidies that are driving up government budget deficits, and both have indignant publics demanding an end to endemic corruption.
Economically, both have sizable current-account deficits compared to their economic output, together with nearly double-digit inflation in consumer prices.
Perhaps most important, both face national elections next year that limit their ability to make politically unappetizing economic decisions: India will elect a new Parliament by the end of May, while Indonesia will elect a new legislature in April and a new president in July.
The different policies outlined on Friday in Jakarta and Mumbai reflect differences in the seriousness of their predicaments, however, with India appearing to be in considerably worse shape.
While Indonesia's ports and highways still have shortcomings, as does the country's bureaucracy, they are good enough that the country has emerged as one destination for the many companies shifting operations away from China in response to surging blue-collar wages there. India's bureaucracy remains stifling, and the potholes and traffic on the country's roads are so bad that vehicles scarcely move faster than walking speed in some areas; in other areas, sometime gruesome crashes are a regular occurrence.
Above all, India's is the more fractious democracy. Indonesia gave political independence to its central bank in 1999, right after the Asian financial crisis. The Bank of Indonesia raised short-term interest rates last week, but the country's business community remains supportive -- Sofjan Wanandi, the influential tycoon who is the chairman of the Employers' Association of Indonesia, said in an interview this week that business leaders were ready to pay even higher interest rates as needed to control inflation.
By contrast, the Reserve Bank of India is subject to the dictates of the government. The Confederation of Indian Industry, the country's most powerful business group, representing the large companies that tend to receive most of Indian bank loans, has been lobbying heavily in recent weeks for a full cut of one percentage point in lending rates.
Emerging markets around the world have seen an exodus of investment, falling currencies and tumbling stock markets since May. That was when the Fed began signaling that it was preparing to start cutting back its purchases of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities -- purchases that had helped keep long-term interest rates low.
Vice President Boediono of Indonesia, a former finance minister and governor of the central bank, said Friday that the Fed's decision on Wednesday to defer a reduction in economic stimulus offers Indonesia a breathing space but does not remove the necessity for prompt action by policy makers here.
While avoiding specifics, Mr. Boediono appeared to hint that he did not expect recent market shifts to be reversed quickly. He said that Indonesia had to adjust "interest rates, even our exchange rate, to a new normal."
He called for a series of supply-side measures to address bottlenecks in the economy that could fuel inflation. These measures included easier land acquisition and permits for infrastructure projects as well as a new system of online education that would span Indonesia's huge archipelago, which stretches a similar distance as Seattle to Tampa.
"Work hard on the supply side, then you can achieve a safe level of inflation without having to really tighten your monetary policy with the costs to growth and so on," he said.
President Xi Jinping of China is scheduled to come to Jakarta next week. President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono of Indonesia will hold discussions with him on some issues, including the South China Sea, Mr. Boediono said, declining to elaborate.
Mr. Boediono said that he would discuss with President Xi the possibility of expanding the bilateral swap agreement between the two countries, but said that the amount of the expansion had not yet been decided. An expanded agreement would allow Indonesia to borrow more dollars from China if needed to buy rupiah in currency markets someday during another period of exchange rate volatility.
Mr. Boediono was elected vice president in the summer of 2009 when President Yudhoyono won a second term. Legislative elections are scheduled for next April and presidential elections for next July; President Yudhoyono is not running for a third five-year term because of term limits.
As a technocrat with a limited political base, Mr. Boediono has not been expected to run for president. He said on Friday that he had no desire for public office after his term ends in October next year and hoped to focus on online education thereafter.

Full text:   Stocks fell on Friday as investors puzzled over the Federal Reserve's decision to maintain its stimulus measures as they heard opposing viewpoints from top Fed officials.
Despite lower closes in the last two sessions, the major stock indexes ended higher for the week. The Dow rose 0.6 percent. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 1.3 percent. The Nasdaq advanced 1.4 percent.
On Wednesday, the Fed surprised economists and investors with its decision to delay scaling back its stimulus.
James B. Bullard, president of the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank, who was interviewed on Bloomberg TV, said a reduction of the Fed's $85 billion monthly bond purchase program beginning in October was possible. Mr. Bullard later said in New York that low inflation meant the Fed could be patient in deciding when to scale back the pace of asset purchases.
But the president of the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank, Esther L. George, sharply criticized her colleagues' decision this week not to reduce the bond-buying program, warning that it sowed confusion and risked the central bank's credibility given the markets' conviction that the policy would be adjusted.
"The market will view this as a bad move on their part," said Stephen Massocca, managing director at Wedbush Equity Management in San Francisco, referring to the Fed, "and we are already seeing that today." He added, "It is also a reflection on what the Fed didn't do and some disappointment with that." During the Fed discussion, two companies made their first stock market appearances with stellar results. New offerings by the Internet security company FireEye opened 101.5 percent above the initial offer price at $40.30, and closed up 80 percent at $36. The ad technology company Rocket Fuel also soared, more than doubling at its opening and ending the session up 93.4 percent at $56.10.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 185.46 points, or 1.19 percent, to 15,451.09, the S.& P. 500 lost 12.42 points, or 0.72 percent, to 1,709.91 and the Nasdaq composite dropped 14.66 points, or 0.39 percent, to 3,774.73.
Caterpillar was one of the biggest drags on the Dow, down 3.4 percent, to $84.75. The company, a maker of heavy machinery, reported disappointing sales for the three-month rolling period ending in August.
Shares of BlackBerry listed in the United States plunged 17.1 percent to $8.73 after the struggling smartphone maker said it would cut 4,500 jobs and that it would badly miss Wall Street's second-quarter expectations.
The benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 4/32, to 97 31/32, with the yield at 2.74 percent, down from 2.75 percent on Thursday.

Full text:   For investors, it's back to the drawing board.
Wall Street is now furiously revising expectations about the role the Federal Reserve will play in the economy in the months ahead.
The bout of introspection comes after the Fed dashed the widespread assumption that it would begin slowing down, or "tapering," its $85 billion-a-month bond buying program -- a stimulus effort that has become a driving force in financial markets.
Over the summer, a number of speeches by the leaders of regional Fed banks were watched carefully and interpreted as supporting a slowing of bond purchases. Many on Wall Street said that in the future, they would pay less attention to flurries of public statements and reconsider the barometers they were using to predict Fed decisions.
"From May forward, the body English suggested that they were ready to taper," said Ken Taubes, the chief investment officer at Pioneer Investments. "Now the moral of the story is, 'Don't look at what we're saying.' "
Until the Fed's surprise announcement on Wednesday, investors had spent months preparing for a slowdown in the Fed's bond purchases by selling off, buying dollars and getting out of countries that relied on low interest rates. On Thursday, investors were buying some of those same assets back, sending up stock indexes 4.6 percent in Indonesia, 3.5 percent in India and 2.3 percent in Pakistan.
In the United States, the signals were more mixed, pointing to uncertainty created by the Fed's decision. The stock market reversed some of the big gains it made in the final hours of trading on Wednesday.
After climbing 1 percent on Wednesday afternoon, the Dow Jones industrial average slipped Thursday by 40.39 points, or 0.3 percent, to close at 15,636.55. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dipped 3.18 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,722.34. The Nasdaq composite index, however, edged up 5.74 points, or 0.2 percent, to 3,789.38.
The yield on Treasury bonds, which dropped sharply on Wednesday, rebounded somewhat, with the rate on the benchmark 10-year bond rising to 2.75 percent from 2.69 percent late Wednesday, pushing the price down 16/32, to 97 27/32.
Many investors realized on Thursday morning that the Fed would not give up on slowing its bond purchases, but instead was only pushing the date out.
Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, said on Wednesday that if measures of inflation and unemployment improved, "we'll take the first step at some point, possibly later this year, and then continue so long as the data are consistent with that continuing progress."
Julia Coronado, an economist at BNP Paribas who correctly predicted the Fed's move on Wednesday, said she still expected the taper to begin as soon as December, given the numerous signs that the recovery is slowly picking up speed.
"The decision wasn't made in fear -- they just want to make sure we get more momentum under our belts," Ms. Coronado said.
But even pushing the next steps out just a few months adds a good dose of uncertainty to the process. Some strategists said that if Mr. Bernanke steps down as Fed chairman at the end of the year, as is widely expected, his successor could have more room to reconsider any slowdown in stimulus.
Moreover, some believe that Mr. Bernanke would be hesitant to make such a big change in policy just a month before leaving the job.
"Frankly, it's set off an awful lot of questions about what's going on, who's in charge and what's happening," said Robert F. Baur, the chief global economist at Principal Global Investors. "I'm not sure the market really knows what to think."
Mr. Bernanke emphasized that part of the reason for the pessimism within the Fed was the return of political fighting in Washington over the federal budget. That is likely to have Wall Street carefully watching the debate in the coming weeks about whether to raise the debt ceiling. But that factor was already on the radar of most economists and accounted for in their forecasts.
The most significant shift in investor thinking is likely to focus on economic data, which Mr. Bernanke said was the primary factor driving the Fed's decision-making.
In the past, many investors focused on Mr. Bernanke's comments in June, when he suggested that the Fed would closely watch for unemployment to fall to 7 percent. This week, Mr. Bernanke played down the importance of the headline unemployment figure, saying it was often an imprecise measure of the job market.
Ms. Coronado, for her part, said she would now pay more attention to the total number of jobs the economy added each month rather than the unemployment rate hitting the 7 percent mark. She noted that the Fed had appeared to be optimistic about the labor market earlier this year when more than 200,000 new jobs were being created each month. More recently, the monthly jobs figure has fallen below that threshold.
Many strategists also took note of Mr. Bernanke's particular emphasis on the low level of inflation, which he said he would like to see increase.
Another major concern for the Fed was the recent jump in interest rates, and with it the rise in mortgage rates, which put a damper on the previously buoyant housing market.
Strategists at Bank of America, who predicted Wednesday's action, said on Thursday that they did not think the Fed would slow down its bond buying until the housing market could sustain a rise in interest rates. Specifically, Bank of America's experts said they were waiting for a time when new mortgage applications would continue to rise even with higher mortgage rates.
"The summer reversal in housing activity was a likely signal to the Fed that the macro is still too fragile to withstand even a small tapering," the Bank of America team wrote in a note to clients.
The latest economic data suggested that the recovery may be staging the sort of acceleration that the Fed wants to see. The number of homes sold in August rose to the highest level in six years, despite predictions that the number would fall, according to figures from the National Association of Realtors.
And an index of manufacturing activity released by the Philadelphia Federal Reserve experienced a sharp jump this month, showing that the pace of growth had more than doubled.
The data was enough to revive speculation about the Fed beginning its tapering sometime this year. But most strategists said that the recent difficulty in predicting the Fed's actions would probably stop many on Wall Street from quickly jumping to any conclusions.
"There's going to be a little more uncertainty about what the Fed's intentions are and what the future holds," said Mr. Baur. "That uncertainty is going to keep people nervous."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text:   MOSCOW -- The Russian government on Thursday approved across-the-board budget cuts over the next two years in the clearest sign yet that officials do not expect its economy, the world's eighth-largest, to revive soon, and that the Kremlin is ready to try a new policy to spur growth.
Making the move more unusual, the cuts come midway through a previously approved spending plan, and they reflect a shift in strategy away from reliance on consumer spending. In Russia, budgets are approved for three years in advance rather than year by year.
The Finance Ministry now projects that revenue will be 3.5 percent lower in 2014 and 7 percent lower in 2015 than it predicted a year ago, when the government of President Vladimir V. Putin approved the three-year spending plan.
Under the revised budget, military salaries will be frozen next year and the government will put less money into a pension fund for future retirees. It will use the money to meet current pension obligations instead.
"The budget turned out really tough," Dmitri A. Medvedev, the prime minister and a former president, said in comments carried by Russian news agencies on Thursday when he presented the new plan. "We had to work off the real situation in the economy in our country, and in the world."
The problems for Russia's economy run deeper than its overwhelming dependence on oil and gas revenue, which account for more than half the federal budget.
Wages that for years rose faster than labor productivity under economic policies that made Mr. Putin widely popular have now priced Russians out of the market for many goods and services globally.
Russia's economy is now growing more slowly than that of the United States. In the second quarter, the gross domestic product rose 1.2 percent in Russia, compared with 2.5 percent in the United States.
Officials spent the summer debating how to reverse the slowing of economic growth here.
In a speech in June, Mr. Putin suggested the Kremlin would try to prime the economy with government spending by dipping into about $171 billion in reserves in sovereign wealth funds to finance infrastructure projects like modernizing the trans-Siberian railway. Those spending plans were never carried out.
Since then, the economic policy team has changed direction, economists say, and the new approach became clear with the release of the plan for cutting the three-year budget rather than running higher deficits.
"They want to change the model of growth in Russia's economy" away from dependence on consumer spending, Vladimir I. Tikhomirov, chief economist at the Otkritie brokerage house, said of the new policy. "The government and central bank have decided their top priority is to bring inflation down."
This shift, Mr. Tikhomirov said, reflects a deep-seated aversion by Mr. Putin to foreign borrowing of the type that made the Soviet Union beholden to Western banks in its later years. In light of the worsening slowdown here, further stimulus would require foreign borrowing.
"It goes against normal economic policy" to cut spending in the face of an economic slowdown, Mr. Tikhomirov said.
The new Russian policy instead retraces a growth strategy followed successfully in the late 1990s by Eastern European nations like Poland, which focused intensely on controlling inflation and borrowing costs for businesses. Though this brought a temporary slowdown, and even recession in some countries, business activity picked up as rates came down.
The Russian government predicted several years of slow growth of about 3 percent, down from the 4.5 percent previously forecast.
But inflation, the bane of post-Soviet Russia for many years, is projected to drop to 4.5 to 5.5 percent next year and below 5 percent in subsequent years, from around 6 percent this year.
Without new growth produced by low interest rates in the later part of this decade, the government will struggle to meet demands for increased spending on pensions for the country's aging population.
In the short term, as inflation is brought under control and before growth picks up, Mr. Putin could find his political support eroding. Mr. Tikhomirov, the Otkritie economist, said the policy should start showing results in 2016 or so, before Mr. Putin is up for re-election in 2018.
The government must submit the plan to the Parliament for approval by Oct. 1, though major changes are unlikely.

Full text:   As the favorite to succeed Ben S. Bernanke to lead the Federal Reserve, Janet L. Yellen faces no shortage of hurdles.
The first would be to win confirmation from the Senate -- an obstacle that doomed the previous front-runner for the job, Lawrence H. Summers.
While Ms. Yellen faces much less potential opposition than Mr. Summers did, the White House is not taking Senate approval for granted. Even as the administration informed legislators on Capitol Hill on Thursday that Ms. Yellen probably would be President Obama's nominee, one official said the point of the calls was not so much to gauge support but to tell Democratic senators they should defend Ms. Yellen if she comes under attack before a formal nomination.
The second, even bigger, challenge would be to manage the central bank's retreat from its unprecedented efforts to stimulate the economy, even as the nation's job market remains frustratingly weak more than four years after the Great Recession.
With the collapse of Mr. Summers's candidacy, White House officials began calling Senate Democrats about the Fed choice; a senior Congressional aide said the only name they mentioned was Ms. Yellen's. Since she has become the focus of public discussion, the president's staff is worried that she could become a target for criticism, just as Mr. Summers was, before the White House actually nominates her and can defend her.
Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat who serves on the Senate Banking Committee, said in an interview Thursday that the White House had accelerated the vetting process for Ms. Yellen.
"Certainly my impression is the White House is taking a very serious and fast-track examination of her as a potential nominee," Mr. Merkley said.
While Ms. Yellen enjoys strong support from Senate Democrats -- a third of the caucus took the unusual step of signing a letter urging the president to nominate her, even before the White House indicated it was leaning toward Mr. Summers -- Senate Republicans will be more difficult to persuade.
Some, like Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, an influential member of the Banking Committee, have expressed reservations about her leadership in the past. Mr. Shelby voted against confirming her as vice chairwoman of the Fed in 2010.
Despite the opposition, Ms. Yellen, if nominated, is expected to win Senate confirmation and assume the leadership of the Fed early next year.
Mr. Bernanke handed his successor a gift this week when the central bank surprised Wall Street and many economists by not easing the stimulus effort.
On Wednesday, Mr. Bernanke walked back his earlier suggestion that the Fed's huge bond-buying effort would cease when the unemployment rate fell to 7 percent, instead leaving the door open for that form of stimulus to continue well into 2014 and perhaps beyond, even if that jobless threshold is breached.
That flexibility is something that Ms. Yellen might well take advantage of. As the most prominent member of the Fed's dovish flank, other than Mr. Bernanke himself, Ms. Yellen has focused more on the dismal state of the labor market and the pressures facing poor and middle-class families than on the potential threat of financial instability and inflation down the road.
In a major speech in February, Ms. Yellen highlighted not only the elevated unemployment rate, but also long-term joblessness, the high poverty rate, sluggish wage growth, labor force dropouts and homelessness as major reasons for the Fed to continue the stimulus. "The effects of the recession and the subsequent slow recovery have been harshest on some of the most vulnerable Americans," Ms. Yellen said.
While the unemployment rate has fallen steadily, hitting a five-year low of 7.3 percent in August, much of that improvement has come from workers dropping out of the labor force rather than vigorous job creation. The monthly pace of new jobs has slowed, falling from well over 200,000 new jobs being added each month at the end of 2012 to 169,000 in August 2013.
A more telling indicator of the continuing weakness of the economy, analysts say, is the proportion of Americans who are part of the labor force, which in August hit 63.2 percent, a 35-year low. While some of that decline is because of structural factors like the retirement of baby boomers and the continuing shift from industrial jobs, the trend has accelerated significantly since 2007, prompting many economists to conclude it is primarily a cyclical phenomenon that can be cured only by faster economic growth.
Mr. Bernanke, in fact, highlighted the falling participation rate in a news conference after the Fed's decision on Wednesday.
"I think there is a cyclical component to participation, and in that respect, the unemployment rate understates the amount of sort of true unemployment, if you will, in the economy," he said.
By stepping back from a threshold that he now says is misleading, Mr. Bernanke indirectly acknowledged just how weak the job market remained, many economists said.
"It's not just about one number reaching a tipping point," said Doug Handler, chief United States economist at IHS. "The unemployment rate is a key indicator but it is not indicative of the overall health of the labor market. By looking at the participation rate, the Fed is using a more holistic assessment."
The drop in labor participation has affected broad swaths of the job market, but men in particular have been hard-hit. For example, the participation rate among men over the age of 16 fell from 73.5 percent in early 2007 to 69.5 percent in August 2013. That is the lowest participation rate for men since the Bureau of Labor Statistics began compiling the data in 1948. The participation rate for women has also fallen, but not as sharply, hitting 57.3 in August 2013, down from 59.4 percent in early 2007.
That disparity was heightened because the sectors that were among the hardest-hit in the recession, like construction and manufacturing, tend to be major employers of men. Other, more robust sectors in the recovery, like health care, tend to employ more women.
For Ms. Yellen, or whoever takes over the Fed, reversing this trend will be difficult, even with the option of keeping the additional stimulus going into 2014 and perhaps beyond. While the Fed's huge bond purchases have helped revive the housing market by keeping interest rates low, the millions of construction jobs that vanished with the housing bust have not returned. The infusion of money into the economy has helped push the stock market to record highs, but companies remain reluctant to hire.
In the end, the key to reviving the labor market is for overall economic growth to increase, said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, who suggested that plenty of Americans were eager for a chance to work again. "To think they won't come back," he said, "is a profoundly depressing view of the American work force."

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- It turns out that the Federal Reserve is not quite ready to let go of its extra efforts to help the economy grow.
All summer, Federal Reserve officials said flattering things about the economy's performance: how strong it looked, how well it was recovering, how eager they were to step back and watch it walk on its own.
But, in a reversal that stunned economists and investors on Wall Street, the Fed said on Wednesday that it would postpone any retreat from its monetary stimulus campaign for at least another month and quite possibly until next year. The Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, emphasized that economic conditions were improving. But he said that the Fed still feared a turn for the worse.
He noted that Congressional Republicans and the White House were hurtling toward an impasse over government spending. That was reinforced on Wednesday, when House leaders said they would seek to pass a federal budget stripping all financing for President Obama's signature health care law, increasing the chances of a government shutdown.
And the Fed undermined its own efforts when it declared in June that it intended to begin a retreat by the end of the year, causing investors to immediately begin to demand higher interest rates on mortgage loans and other financial products, a trend that the Fed said Wednesday was threatening to slow the economy.
"We have been overoptimistic," Mr. Bernanke said at a news conference Wednesday. The Fed, he said, is "avoiding a tightening until we can be comfortable that the economy is in fact growing the way that we want it to be growing."
Investors cheered the Fed's hesitation. The Standard & Poor's 500 stock-index rose 1.22 percent, to close at a record high, in nominal terms. Interest rates also fell; the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury reversed some of its recent rise.
Some analysts, however, warned that the unexpected announcement was likely to worsen confusion about the Fed's plans, increasing the volatility of the markets in the coming months as investors sort through the Fed's mixed messages about how much longer it plans to continue its bond-buying campaign. The delay also means that the decision to retreat may ultimately be made by the next Fed chairman, after Mr. Bernanke steps down at the end of January. President Obama has said that he plans to nominate a replacement as soon as next week. Janet L. Yellen, the Fed's vice chairman, is the leading candidate.
"The cost of not setting out on a default gradual glide path for completing QE3 today is that this issue is now likely to be front and center in the nomination and confirmation process for the new Fed chair," wrote Krishna Guha, head of central bank strategy at the financial services firm International Strategy & Investment, referring to the Fed's asset purchases of quantitative easing.
The Fed unrolled an aggressive combination of new policies last year in an effort to encourage a housing recovery and increase the pace of job creation. It started adding $85 billion a month to its holdings of Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities, to help keep long-term borrowing costs down and said it planned to keep buying until the outlook for the labor market improved substantially. The Fed also said it would keep short-term rates near zero for even longer -- at least as long as the unemployment rate remained above 6.5 percent.
Half a year later, in June, Mr. Bernanke surprised many investors by announcing that the Fed intended to start cutting back on those asset purchases by the end of 2013. Fed officials reiterated that intention in July, and several officials had since suggested that the Fed might begin to pull back at the September meeting. It is also scheduled to meet next month and in mid-December.
Some critics question the Fed's assessment of the economy, in particular its claim that a declining unemployment rate is a sign of progress. They note that unemployment is falling in part because fewer people are looking for work, and therefore are no longer officially counted as unemployed.
The Fed now appears to be giving that argument greater credence, and on Wednesday Mr. Bernanke played down the Fed's earlier use of unemployment rate thresholds to describe the goals for its policies. He refused to repeat a comment he had made in June that the Fed planned to keep buying bonds until the unemployment rate reached roughly 7 percent. He also emphasized that the Fed was likely to keep short-term rates near zero well after unemployment fell below 6.5 percent, the threshold the Fed had established last year.
The Fed's concern, he suggested, is that things could get worse, either because of new cuts in federal spending, a political impasse in Washington over fiscal matters that threatened to undermine the economy, or because the Fed pulled back prematurely.
Fiscal policy "is restraining economic growth," the Fed said in a statement after a regular two-day meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee. It added, "The tightening of financial conditions observed in recent months, if sustained, could slow the pace of improvement in the economy and the labor market."
Mr. Bernanke sought to explain the Fed's hesitation in more detail. He said the Fed wanted to see three things: Evidence that the drag from fiscal policy is diminishing, that inflation is returning to a healthy level, and that job growth is sustainable.
"If it does," he said, "we'll take the first step at some point, possibly later this year."
The decision was supported by nine of the 10 voting members of the Federal Open Market Committee. Esther George, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, dissented as she has at each previous meeting this year, citing concerns about inflation and financial stability. The committee was short two members, because of the retirement of former governor Elizabeth A. Duke and the recusal of governor Sarah Bloom Raskin, nominated to be deputy Treasury secretary.
In their economic forecasts, also published Wednesday, Fed officials retreated from overly optimistic predictions about the pace of growth over the next several years, as they have done repeatedly since the end of the recession. The aggregation of forecasts showed that Fed officials now expect growth to remain sluggish for years to come, with persistent unemployment and little inflation.
The middle of the forecast range for economic growth this year was 2 to 2.3 percent, down from June predictions of growth of 2.3 to 2.6 percent. For 2013, Fed officials forecast growth of 2.9 to 3.1 percent, down from a range of 3 to 3.5 percent.
While the Fed postponed its retreat, interest rates remained higher than before it started talking about tapering, in the United States, Europe and emerging markets. The Fed statements then "effectively brought monetary tightening forward in time," the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland, a clearinghouse for central banks worldwide, said in its quarterly report this week.
Investors who put their money into countries like China or Brazil in search of higher returns have been withdrawing it as investment opportunities improve in the United States. That outflow of wealth is also bad for export-driven economies like Germany. Foreign orders for German machinery fell 9 percent in July from a year earlier, according to the German Engineering Federation, an industry group.
In an attempt to soften the market reaction, the European Central Bank has promised to keep its benchmark interest rate at a record low indefinitely. But analysts say it is unlikely that words alone will be enough to keep rates low.
"The world has become more interdependent," Norbert Reithofer, chief executive of the German automaker BMW, told reporters at the Frankfurt motor show last week. "When Ben Bernanke makes a statement, it has an effect on the Indian rupee, it has an effect on the Turkish lira, it has an effect on the South African rand."
"We are going to be confronted with this situation more and more often," Mr. Reithofer said.

Abstract: The economy's problems -- a weak labor market, stagnant wages, insufficient consumer demand, widening income inequality, intractable poverty -- are not primarily the Fed's to solve.

Full text:   The Federal Reserve did the right thing when it decided on Wednesday not to begin reducing the monthly, multibillion-dollar bond purchases that are a pillar of its efforts to spur the economy. To do otherwise would have violated the Fed's own criteria for gradually withdrawing the support measures.
The Fed has said that any easing would be premised on "substantial improvement" in the labor market. But job growth has been slowing of late, and what little there has been has tended to be in low-paying jobs. The Fed has also been looking for a sizable increase in economic growth, but that has not materialized and is unlikely to, given various headwinds, including the prospect of another round of damaging budget fights in Washington.
The decision to stay the course is also important because it indicates that the Fed is giving due consideration to both sides of its dual mandate to foster both price stability and full employment. The bond-buying program, which is intended to bolster the economy by keeping long-term borrowing rates low, is not without peril. But its biggest danger -- rising inflation -- is nowhere in evidence. That means that the potential stimulative benefits of the bond purchases still outweigh the potential downsides.
That does not mean that the program is an ideal or even particularly effective way to combat persistent economic weakness. The economy's problems -- a weak labor market, stagnant wages, insufficient consumer demand, widening income inequality, intractable poverty -- are not primarily the Fed's to solve. Rather, they require direct government policies to create jobs, raise wages, spur demand, increase taxes on the wealthy and expand the safety net.
These, however, are Congress's responsibilities, thwarted largely by Republicans, who have opposed policies that would help the economy (and thus reflect well on President Obama) while promoting automatic budget cuts and other policies that can only slow the recovery. Without naming names, the Fed said as much in its statement when it singled out "the extent of federal fiscal retrenchment" as a particular drag on the economy.
The Fed should do whatever it can. But only Congress can provide what most needs to be done.

Full text:   JAKARTA, Indonesia -- When the Asian financial crisis hit in 1997, sales plummeted 95 percent and stayed down for six months at the IGP Group, Indonesia's dominant manufacturer of car and truck axles. Four-fifths of the company's workers lost their jobs.
When the global financial crisis began in 2008, IGP's sales briefly dropped nearly one-third, and a quarter of the employees were put out of work.
The latest downturn, which began in early August, has been much more modest. IGP's axle shipments are down 10 percent in the last month from a year ago. The company's work force has barely shrunk, to 2,000 from 2,077 at the end of July, though IGP plans to reach 1,900 by the end of this year.
"These are challenging times, but I don't think they will be the same as in 2008 or 1998," Kusharijono, IGP's operations director, who uses only one name, yelled over a clanking, cream-colored assembly line here for minivan rear axles.
From Indonesia and India to Turkey and Brazil, capital flight from developing economies to the United States is already causing hardship for millions of businesses and workers. More was expected if the Federal Reserve decided to retreat from its economic stimulus campaign of buying billions of dollars in bonds each month.
That it decided on Wednesday not to stop may relieve some companies, government leaders and economists who worried that rising interest rates in the United States would draw tens of billions of dollars out of emerging markets and cause local currencies to fall further against the dollar.
Investors have been moving money into dollar-based investments that offer higher yields.
But the Fed's announcement Wednesday afternoon took currency traders by surprise, and the dollar plunged against major currencies. The dollar fell a little more than 1 percent against the euro and the yen after the announcement, giving companies in the developing economies a little more breathing room. On Thursday, currencies in Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines and Malaysia, which have fallen sharply in recent months, headed higher, with the Indonesian rupiah gaining about 1.5 percent against the dollar by late morning in Asia.
The economic slowdowns in the developing economies seem less severe so far than in other recent downturns. While previous exoduses by investors from volatile emerging markets have caused waves of bank failures, corporate bankruptcies and mass layoffs, the latest retrenchment has been much milder so far. That partly reflects the belief that when the Fed does move, it will scale back its bond purchases very gradually, business leaders and economists around the world said in interviews this week. The effects have also been limited partly because banks, companies and their regulators in many emerging markets have become much more careful about borrowing in dollars over the last two decades, except when they expect dollar revenue with which to repay these debts.
In 1997 and 1998, "the whole problem began with the banking sector. Now I think the banking sector is much better," said Sofjan Wanandi, a tycoon who is the chairman of the Indonesian Employers' Association and part owner of IGP.
Trading in currency and stock markets seems to suggest that some of the worst fears over the summer are starting to recede. The Brazilian real has recovered about 8 percent of its value against the dollar since Aug. 21 and a little over a third of its losses since the start of May, when worries began to spread about the vulnerability of emerging markets to a tightening of monetary policy. Stock markets from India to South Africa have rallied from lows in late August, with Johannesburg's market up 14.7 percent since late June after a swoon earlier than most emerging markets.
"While the Fed hasn't started the tapering process as yet, there has been a considerable withdrawal of money in the emerging markets and especially in India since May. In my opinion, the major effect has already taken place," said Sujan Hajra, the chief economist at AnandRathi, an investment bank based in Mumbai.
One lingering question is how much inflation will accelerate in emerging markets. Many of their industries depend heavily on commodities like oil that are priced in dollars.
Weakening exchange rates this year for almost every emerging market's currency have made these dollar-denominated commodities more expensive. That is starting to drive up inflation in a few countries that do not subsidize fuel prices, and it is adding to government deficits in many countries, like India and Indonesia, that do.
In Brazil, an increase in transportation fares set off street protests in June, leading to broad demonstrations over corruption and lamentable public services. Salomão Quadros, an economist at Fundação Getulio Vargas, a top Brazilian university, said inflation was expected to reach about 6 percent this year as imported goods become more expensive.
While that level exceeds the central bank's inflation target of 4.5 percent, inflation in Brazil still remains much lower than it has been in other stretches of market turbulence, as in 2003, when inflation rose to about 15 percent. "Brazil is facing some difficulties, but we're not in crisis territory," Mr. Quadros said.
The most vulnerable companies are those that mostly sell domestically in their local currency but have debts or costs denominated heavily in dollars. One example is the plastics industry, which often relies on imported resins made to a large extent from high-priced oil.
Ahmet Nalincioglu, the managing director of Elektroplasmin, a plastic packaging company based in Istanbul, said many plastics producers would have to try to raise prices. Yet Elektroplasmin has yearlong contracts with clients that are hard to change.
"Our price hikes will automatically have a negative impact on their profit margins, which means they will be reluctant to negotiate," Mr. Nalincioglu said. "If I can't agree on a price, I get stuck with the stock for a year and suffer huge losses."
The most vulnerable countries are those running large trade deficits they have been financing with dollars from overseas investors' purchases of local assets like real estate, stocks and bonds. India is conspicuous on that list, as its poor roads and stifling bureaucracy have discouraged exports and resulted in its luring few of the factories now moving out of China in response to surging wages there.
A few emerging markets, still traumatized by the extent of their economic downturns during previous periods of capital flight, are taking drastic action to stabilize their currencies. Indonesia had one of the few emerging market currencies that was still falling through last week, but the central bank stopped the drop last Thursday when it unexpectedly raised its two benchmark interest rates by a quarter percent.
The interest rate increase made it more attractive for international investors to lend money to Indonesia, but at the risk of further weakening a domestic economy that is already decelerating.
Didik Rachbini, one of the 21 members of the presidential National Economic Council here, said the Indonesian government was also discussing delays in big investment projects by state-owned enterprises, to conserve foreign exchange. Work like road construction that requires few imports of equipment is likely to proceed, while capital-intensive projects that rely on foreign technology should face extra scrutiny and are starting to be reviewed, he said.
Most affected by the economic slowdown are workers in developing countries who were already scrimping. Hasan Qodri, a 22-year-old axle quality inspector at Indonesia's IGP, said he regretted the disappearance of overtime -- and the extra pay that went with it.
"Of course I would like more overtime," he said, "so I'd have more money for my daily life."

Abstract: Mr. Rouhani, preparing for a trip to New York next week for the annual gathering of the United Nations, kept up the dizzying pace on Wednesday in an interview with NBC News in which he declared that Iran would never "seek weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons" and that he had "full power and complete authority" to make a nuclear deal with the West.

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDEDTEHRAN -- A series of good-will gestures and hints of new diplomatic flexibility from Iran's ruling establishment was capped on Wednesday by the highest-level statement yet that the country's new leaders are pushing for a compromise in negotiations over their disputed nuclear program.
In a near staccato burst of pronouncements, statements and speeches by the new president, Hassan Rouhani; his foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif; and even the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the leadership has sent Rosh Hashana greetings to Jews worldwide via Twitter, released political prisoners, exchanged letters with President Obama, praised "flexibility" in negotiations and transferred responsibility for nuclear negotiations from the conservatives in the military to the Foreign Ministry.
"They're putting stuff out faster than the naysayers can keep up," said Gary Sick, an Iran expert with Columbia University. "They dominate the airwaves."
Mr. Rouhani, preparing for a trip to New York next week for the annual gathering of the United Nations, kept up the dizzying pace on Wednesday in an interview with NBC News in which he declared that Iran would never "seek weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons" and that he had "full power and complete authority" to make a nuclear deal with the West.
There is plenty of skepticism in the West over the new tone emanating from Tehran, and Iran veterans have seen previous thaws in the diplomatic climate disappear seemingly overnight. Mr. Obama has spoken of testing Mr. Rouhani's seriousness.
But Iran experts, citing the apparent end to Iran's ideological taboo against direct talks with the United States as well as the apparent concurrence of the supreme leader, say that this new moderation seems different.
Tehran's turnaround is all the more startling in view of the eight, often bizarre, years of Mr. Rouhani's Holocaust-denying predecessor, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who relished every opportunity to ruffle the feathers of Western leaders. But Mr. Ahmadinejad's bellicose nationalism drove Iran into a diplomatic isolation that left it with Venezuela and Syria for allies and saddled it with debilitating economic sanctions over its nuclear program, analysts said.
Those sanctions have more than halved Iran's oil sales, from 2.4 million barrels a day in 2011 to less than 1 million now, and inflation has spiked; the currency, the rial, has fallen by half. It was the danger of falling even deeper into this economic abyss, possibly threatening their hold on power, that prompted Iran's leaders to mend ties not only with the West but with their own people, who desperately want more personal freedoms, analysts say.
"We are now at a unique moment in the Islamic republic's history," said Farshad Ghorbanpour, a political analyst close to Mr. Rouhani. "Economic reasons are now justifying political reasons to talk to the U.S."
The current moment differs significantly from an earlier reform period under President Mohammad Khatami, when the rules on public behavior and freedom of expression were relaxed. But in contrast to the current situation, Mr. Khatami never had the serious backing of the Iranian political establishment. "Our supreme leader, Mr. Khamenei, has given the green light; that means there will be no groups trying to sabotage potential talks like in the past," Mr. Ghorbanpour said.
When he arrives in New York next week, one expert said, Mr. Rouhani will be bringing along a package of proposals on Iran's nuclear program, which Tehran says is for peaceful purposes but the West believes is a cover for developing weapons.
"I think he will be able to discuss Iran putting a cap on the number of uranium enrichment centrifuges, the conversion of the stockpile of uranium enriched up to 20 percent into harmless fuel plates or dilute it down to 3, 5 percent," said Mohammad Ali Shabani, a political analyst based in Tehran who holds moderate views. There could also be talks of Iran accepting more inspections by at some point ratifying an additional protocol to the United Nations' nuclear nonproliferation treaty, Mr. Shabani said.
The German newsmagazine Der Spiegel reported that Mr. Rouhani might also be ready to close down Fordo, Iran's highly secure mountain bunker, which is believed to be safe from any Israeli attack. But Mr. Shabani said this would not happen. "This site is Iran's insurance card in case of a military attack," he said. "I highly doubt Iran would close that down."
Mr. Rouhani has also indicated that he prefers to negotiate over the nuclear case with the West on the highest political levels possible, and there was even talk of a meeting next week with Mr. Obama, an event that would have been all but inconceivable only weeks ago.
Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, said Wednesday that there were no plans for Mr. Obama to meet with Mr. Rouhani when both leaders are at the United Nations early next week. But he said the president was eager to see whether the issue of Iran's nuclear program could be resolved.
"As we have long said, the window of opportunity for resolving this diplomatically is open, but it will not remain open indefinitely," Mr. Carney said.
Mr. Obama, in an interview this week with Noticias Telemundo, mentioned "indications" that Mr. Rouhani "is looking to open dialogue with the West and with the United States in a way that we haven't seen in the past. And so we should test it."
Mr. Rouhani, asked in the NBC News interview if he thought Mr. Obama looked weak when he backed off from a threat to conduct a missile strike against Syria over a deadly chemical weapons attack outside Damascus on Aug. 21, replied: "We consider war a weakness. Any government or administration that decides to wage a war, we consider a weakness. And any government that decides on peace, we look on it with respect to peace."
The diplomatic offensive by Mr. Rouhani and his foreign minister, Mr. Zarif, seems to have been planned months ago. Even as a presidential candidate he was emphasizing that détente with the West was the key to solving Iran's domestic problems. "You must know that this key can solve the nuclear problem and the sanctions. It will lead to economic growth," he said in one televised debate in May.
He has long made clear that Iran needs to show more transparency in its nuclear activities, to build trust with the West. "After that we will prevent new sanctions against our country, and gradually they will be lifted so we will be free of all of them," Mr. Rouhani said.
The recent publicity campaign was probably carefully planned, too, experts said. "Actually it's kind of a blitz attack that Iran is doing. Their intent is very clear, that is to distinguish themselves -- this is the anti-Ahmadinejad," said Mr. Sick, who was a national security adviser during the Iranian hostage crisis. "I'd say they're succeeding. They're also aware there's a huge degree of skepticism in the West, particularly the United States, and there's a standard body of opinion that nothing has changed in Iran."
In the coming weeks and months Iran will be looking for reciprocal steps from the West, analysts say, so that Mr. Rouhani can point to some tangible rewards for his conciliation. Otherwise, nationalist voices in Iran will begin to attack his credibility.
"There has to be some sort of gesture by the U.S.," Mr. Shabani said. "Iran's hard-liners will want to see results within six months or so. If not, expect a lot more inflexibility from Iran."
Correction: September 21, 2013, Saturday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Because of an editing error, an article on Thursday about a series of good-will gestures and hints of new diplomatic flexibility from Iran's ruling establishment referred incorrectly to Rosh Hashana greetings sent by the country's leadership via Twitter. The greetings were addressed to Jews worldwide, not just to those in Israel.

Full text:   In some respects, 1988 has the feel of an alien, distant era. There was no such thing as the World Wide Web then. The Soviet Union was still around; the Berlin Wall still standing. Americans elected a Republican president who would raise taxes to help tame the budget deficit.
On Tuesday, however, the Census Bureau reminded me how for most Americans 1988 still looks a lot like yesterday: last year, the typical household made $51,017, roughly the same as the typical household made a quarter of a century ago.
The statistic is staggering -- hardly what one would expect from one of the richest and most technologically advanced nations on the planet.
I have written several times before about how measures of social and economic well-being in the United States have slipped compared to other advanced countries. But it is even more poignant to recognize that, in many ways, America has been standing still for a full generation.
It made me wonder what happened to progress.
Consider: 36 years ago this month, when NASA launched the Voyager 1 probe into space, 11.6 percent of Americans were officially considered poor. The other day Voyager sailed clear out of the solar system into interstellar space -- the first man-made object to do so -- recording its environment on an 8-track deck.
Using the same official metric -- which actually undercounts the poor compared to new methods used by the Census today -- the poverty rate is 15 percent.
To be sure, we have made progress over the last 25 years. The nation's gross domestic product per person has increased 40 percent since 1988. We've gained four years' worth of life expectancy at birth. The infant mortality rate has plummeted by 50 percent. More women and more men are entering and graduating from college.
We also have access to far more sophisticated consumer goods, from the iPhone to cars packed with digital devices. And the cost of many basic staples, notably food, has fallen significantly.
Carl Shapiro, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley and an expert on technology and innovation who stepped down from President Obama's Council on Economic Advisors last year, calls the progress in information technology and biotechnology over the last 25 years "breathtaking."
"Most Americans partake in the benefits offered by these new technologies, from smartphones to better dental care," Professor Shapiro said. Still, he acknowledged, "somehow this impressive progress has not translated into greater economic security for the American middle class."
In key respects, in fact, the standard of living of most Americans has fallen decidedly behind. Just take the cost of medical services. Health care spending per person, adjusted for inflation, has roughly doubled since 1988, to about $8,500 -- pushing up health insurance premiums and eating into workers' wages.
The cost of going to college has been rising faster than inflation as well. About two-thirds of people with bachelor's degrees relied on loans to get through college, up from 45 percent two decades ago. Average student debt in 2011 was $23,300.
In contrast to people in other developed nations, who have devoted more time to leisure as they have gotten richer, Americans work about as much as they did a quarter-century ago. Despite all this toil, the net worth of the typical American family in the middle of the income distribution fell to $66,000 in 2010 -- 6 percent less than in 1989 after inflation.
Though the bursting of the housing bubble and ensuing great recession takes a big share of the blame for families' weakening finances, it is nonetheless startling that a single financial event -- only a hiccup on the road to prosperity of Americans on the top of the pile -- could erase a generation worth of progress for those in the middle.
Though the statistics may be startling, the story they tell is, unfortunately, not surprising. It is the story of America's new normal. In the new normal the share of the nation's income channeled to corporate profits is higher than at any time since the 1920s, while workers' share languishes at its lowest since 1965.
In the new normal, the real wages of workers on the factory floor are lower than they were in the early '70s. And the richest 10 percent of Americans get over half of the income America produces.
"Almost all of the benefits of growth since the trough of the Great Recession have been going to those in the upper classes," said Timothy Smeeding, who heads the Institute for Research on Poverty at the University of Madison-Wisconsin. "Middle- and lower-income families are getting a smaller slice of a smaller economic pie as labor markets have changed drastically during our recovery."
This story is about three decades old.
In 2010, the Department of Commerce published a study about what it would take for different types of families to achieve the aspirations of the middle class -- which it defined as a house, a car or two in the garage, a vacation now and then, decent health care and enough savings to retire and contribute to the children's college education.
It concluded that the middle class has become a much more exclusive club. Even two-earner families making almost $81,000 in 2008 -- substantially more than the family median of about $60,000 reported by the Census -- would have a much tougher time acquiring the attributes of the middle class than in 1990.
The incomes of these types of families actually rose by a fifth between 1990 and 2008, according to the report. They were more educated and worked more hours, on average, and had children at a later age. Still, that was no match for the 56 percent jump in the cost of housing, the 155 percent leap in out-of-pocket spending on health care and the double-digit increase in the cost of college.
So either we define the middle class down a couple of notches or we acknowledge that the middle class isn't in the middle anymore.

Abstract: Food stamps, if counted as income, would have kept out four million. Since the recession ended in 2009, income gains have accrued almost entirely to the top earners, the Census Bureau found. [...]those in the bottom 80 percent of the income distribution are generally making considerably less than they had been, hit by high rates of unemployment and nonexistent wage growth. [...]economists believe that the report understates the degree of income inequality in the United States, by not including, among other things, earnings from capital gains made on rising stock prices.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Despite the addition of more than two million jobs last year, soaring corporate profits and continuing economic growth, income for the typical American household did not rise in 2012 and poverty failed to fall, new data from the Census Bureau show.
"The poverty and income numbers are a metaphor for the entire economy," said Ron Haskins of the Brookings Institution. "Everything's on hold, but at a bad level."
Over a longer perspective, the figures reveal that the income of the median American household today, adjusted for inflation, is no higher than it was for the equivalent household in the late 1980s.
For all but the most highly educated and affluent Americans, incomes have stagnated, or worse, for more than a decade. The census report found that median household income, adjusted for inflation, was $51,017 in 2012, down about 9 percent from an inflation-adjusted peak of $56,080 in 1999, mostly as a result of the longest and most damaging recession since the Depression. Most people have had no gains since the economy hit bottom in 2009.
The government's authoritative annual report on incomes, poverty and health insurance, released Tuesday, underscores that the economic recovery has largely failed to reach the poor and the middle class, even as the unemployment rate continues to sink and growth has returned.
Government programs remain a lifeline for millions. Unemployment insurance, whose eligibility the federal government expanded in response to the downturn, kept 1.7 million people out of poverty last year. Food stamps, if counted as income, would have kept out four million.
Since the recession ended in 2009, income gains have accrued almost entirely to the top earners, the Census Bureau found. The top 5 percent of earners -- households making more than about $191,000 a year -- have recovered their losses and earned about as much in 2012 as they did before the recession. But those in the bottom 80 percent of the income distribution are generally making considerably less than they had been, hit by high rates of unemployment and nonexistent wage growth.
Moreover, economists believe that the report understates the degree of income inequality in the United States, by not including, among other things, earnings from capital gains made on rising stock prices.
In one glimmer of improvement, the number of men working full time year-round with earnings increased by one million from 2011 to 2012, to a total of 59 million. Still, the labor market continues to look weak, in particular for less-educated and lower-income men. The labor force participation rate of men has fallen steadily for the past 60 years. In no small part, that is because the median earnings of men working full time have not increased in real terms since the early 1970s.
For women, the earnings stall started about a decade ago, when the gender pay gap stopped closing. "The wage gap hasn't budged a penny," said Fatima Goss Graves of the National Women's Law Center. "After 11 years of no progress on equal pay, policy makers need to get moving to improve the country's pay discrimination laws, raise the minimum wage and remove the barriers women face in higher-wage jobs."
The West was the only region that experienced a statistically significant increase in median income, the Census Bureau said, while all other regions were flat. That most likely reflects the relatively strong growth in Washington, Oregon, California and Utah last year. North Dakota, experiencing an oil and gas boom, is the fastest-growing state, though its population is so small that it barely affects the national statistics.
No racial or ethnic group experienced significant changes in income, but that left the gap between Asians, at the top, and blacks, at the bottom, as wide as before. The median income for Asian households was $68,600. For non-Hispanic whites, it was about $57,000, while the typical Hispanic household had an income of $39,000, and blacks were at $33,300.
The poverty rate held steady at about 15 percent in 2012, about 2.5 percentage points higher than before the recession began. Neither the number nor the proportion of people living in poverty changed from 2011 to 2012, the Census Bureau found.
"The continued high rate of poverty is no surprise, given ongoing high unemployment, stagnant wages and government spending cuts," Sheldon Danziger, the president of the Russell Sage Foundation, a nonprofit organization that studies poverty, said in a statement. "Unless we find ways to strengthen job opportunities and enhance the social safety net, we'll continue to get disappointing news about the poverty rate from the Census Bureau each September."
The proportion of Americans living in poverty has either increased or held steady for 11 of the last 12 years.
The share of Americans without health insurance dropped to 15.4 percent in 2012, from 15.7 percent in 2011. Much of the change over the past two years has come from early provisions of the Affordable Care Act that are expanding coverage, especially a policy letting young adults up to age 26 remain on their parents' health care plans.
The health insurance figures in the report will help form a baseline for a much sharper transformation coming next year, when at least 20 states will expand their Medicaid programs to cover millions of low-income Americans, with the federal government picking up most of the tab.
While things have stopped getting worse, officials acknowledged that the economic recovery had failed to translate into improvements for most families. "We are not where we want to be yet," Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew said at the Economic Club of Washington before the report came out. "Too many Americans cannot find work, growth is not fast enough, and the very definition of what it means to be middle class is being undercut by trends in our economy that must be addressed."
The census report looks only at money income, not income measured after taxes are taken out or tax credits are added in. It also does not measure the effects of many government transfer programs that help lift families' spending, like public housing subsidies, food stamps or Medicaid.
Since the recession hit, the government has increased tax levies on the wealthiest Americans and has expanded many programs that aid the poor and the working class.
Still, reversing the tidal economic trends that have squeezed millions of families would take significant policy changes that are unlikely to occur because of the sharp partisan divide in Washington.
"The good news from today's 2012 income and poverty results is that for the first year since the Great Recession hit, things aren't getting worse," Jared Bernstein of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a former Obama economics official and a contributor to The New York Times's Economix blog, wrote in his analysis of the numbers. "The bad news is that three years into an economic recovery, they're not getting better either."

Abstract: In normal times, the Fed tries to guide the economy by buying and selling short-term U.S. debt, which effectively lets it control short-term interest rates. Since 2008, however, short-term rates have been near zero, which means that they can't go lower (since people would just hoard cash instead).

Full text:   This week the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee -- the group of men and women who set U.S. monetary policy -- will be holding its sixth meeting of 2013. At the meeting's end, the committee is widely expected to announce the so-called "taper" -- a slowing of the pace at which it buys long-term assets.
Memo to the Fed: Please don't do it. True, the arguments for a taper are neither crazy nor stupid, which makes them unusual for current U.S. policy debate. But if you think about the balance of risks, this is a bad time to be doing anything that looks like a tightening of monetary policy.
O.K., what are we talking about here? In normal times, the Fed tries to guide the economy by buying and selling short-term U.S. debt, which effectively lets it control short-term interest rates. Since 2008, however, short-term rates have been near zero, which means that they can't go lower (since people would just hoard cash instead). Yet the economy has remained weak, so the Fed has tried to gain traction through unconventional measures -- mainly by buying longer-term bonds, both U.S. government debt and bonds issued by federally sponsored home-lending agencies.
Now the Fed is talking about slowing the pace of these purchases, bringing them to a complete halt by sometime next year. Why?
One answer is the belief that these purchases -- especially purchases of government debt -- are, in the end, not very effective. There's a fair bit of evidence in support of that belief, and for the view that the most effective thing the Fed can do is signal that it plans to keep short-term rates, which it really does control, low for a very long time.
Unfortunately, financial markets have clearly decided that the taper signals a general turn away from boosting the economy: expectations of future short-term rates have risen sharply since taper talk began, and so have crucial long-term rates, notably mortgage rates. In effect, by talking about tapering, the Fed has already tightened monetary policy quite a lot.
But is that such a bad thing? That's where the second argument comes in: the suggestions that there really isn't that much slack in the U.S. economy, that we aren't that far from full employment. After all, the unemployment rate, which peaked at 10 percent in late 2009, is now down to 7.3 percent, and there are economists who believe that the U.S. economy might begin to "overheat," to show signs of accelerating inflation, at an unemployment rate as high as 6.5 percent. Time for the Fed to take its foot off the gas pedal?
I'd say no, for a couple of reasons.
First, there's less to that decline in unemployment than meets the eye. Unemployment hasn't come down because a higher percentage of adults is employed; it's come down almost entirely because a declining percentage of adults is participating in the labor force, either by working or by actively seeking work. And at least some of the Americans who dropped out of the labor force after 2007 will come back in as the economy improves, which means that we have more ground to make up than that unemployment number suggests.
How misleading is the unemployment number? That's a hard one, on which reasonable people disagree. The question the Fed should be asking is, what is the balance of risks?
Suppose, on one side, that the Fed were to hold off on tightening, then learn that the economy was closer to full employment than it thought. What would happen? Well, inflation would rise, although probably only modestly. Would that be such a bad thing? Right now inflation is running below the Fed's target of 2 percent, and many serious economists -- including, for example, the chief economist of the International Monetary Fund -- have argued for a higher target, say 4 percent. So the cost of tightening too late doesn't look very high.
Suppose, on the other side, that the Fed were to tighten early, then learn that it had moved too soon. This could damage an already weak recovery, causing hundreds of billions if not trillions of dollars in economic damage, leaving hundreds of thousands if not millions of additional workers without jobs and inflicting long-term damage as more and more of the unemployed are perceived as unemployable.
The point is that while there is legitimate uncertainty about what the Fed should be doing, the costs of being too harsh vastly exceed the costs of being too lenient. To err is human; to err on the side of growth is wise.
I'd add that one of the prevailing economic policy sins of our time has been allowing hypothetical risks, like the fiscal crisis that never came, to trump concerns over economic damage happening in the here and now. I'd hate to see the Fed fall into that trap.
So my message is, don't do it. Don't taper, don't tighten, until you can see the whites of inflation's eyes. Give jobs a chance.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Five years ago, the investment bank Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy. The credit markets seized. The unemployment rate soared. Small and large financial institutions shook, and some fell, as the economy plunged into the deepest recession since the Great Depression.
On Sunday, the Obama administration celebrated its successes in combating the recession, while acknowledging the difficulties that remain: while the corporate economy has rebounded strongly, the middle class and its aspirants continue to feel the squeeze of high unemployment and sluggish wage growth.
The White House warned this weekend that Congressional recalcitrance on raising the federal debt ceiling might hurt the economy at a still-fragile time, with Gene B. Sperling, the director of the National Economic Council, warning in a call with reporters about the "unnecessary threatening of default" this fall.
"Thanks to the grit and resilience of the American people, we've cleared away the rubble from the financial crisis and begun to lay a new foundation for stronger, more durable economic growth," a White House report said.
"The last thing we can afford right now is a decision from Congress to throw our economy back into crisis by refusing to pay our country's bills or shutting down the government," it said.
Mr. Sperling, the chief White House economic adviser, said that the negotiations over the debt ceiling in 2011 proved harmful to the economy -- with some business leaders ranking them "with Pearl Harbor or 9/11" in terms of their hit to consumer confidence.
The economy remains weak as the Obama administration and Congressional Republicans prepare themselves for another round of bruising budget talks.
The unemployment rate has fallen to 7.3 percent. But a smaller proportion of Americans are working or looking for work than at any time in the last 35 years. And millions of wage-earning families have become poorer over the past decade, judging by wage growth and inflation.
The short-term measure financing the government will run out at the end of September, raising the risk of a government shutdown. The Obama administration anticipates running out of room under its statutory debt ceiling around mid-October, meaning that Congress might have to authorize the printing of new debt or deal with the unprecedented consequences of a default.

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDEDU.S. News & World Report released its eagerly anticipated annual rankings of universities and colleges this week, and two of the usual suspects -- Princeton University and Williams College -- came out on top. Prospective students and their parents can evaluate these institutions on a variety of measures deemed important by U.S. News.
What they won't find is any way to assess what some consider the most important issue in this still-tough economy: How much can graduates of these schools expect to earn?
For those answers, long a taboo within the hallowed walls of academia, they can turn to PayScale.com. Like U.S. News, PayScale this week released its latest rankings of colleges and universities. But its rankings are all about incomes and jobs. It ranks over a thousand institutions by the average earnings of their graduates. It also calculates and ranks the average return on investment for a college and the percentage of graduates holding jobs with "high meaning." Some of those results may come as a shock, especially to graduates of some prestigious colleges.
There's a fairly high correlation between the reputation and selectivity-weighted rankings of U.S. News and the future earnings measures of PayScale. Ivy League graduates do quite well by both measures, with Princeton ranked sixth and Harvard eighth in PayScale's rankings based on "midcareer median salary."
But many liberal arts colleges suffer in the comparison, including some prestigious ones. Oberlin, 25th on the U.S. News list of national liberal arts colleges, is 218th on the PayScale ranking; Colorado College, 31 on the U.S. News list, is 291; and Grinnell, at 17 on U.S. News, is 366.
Elon University, ranked by U.S. News as the No. 1 regional university in the South, is a distant 587 on PayScale's list.
And there's a notable gender gap. Women's colleges rank especially low: Wellesley (U.S. News, 7) is 304; Barnard (U.S. News, 32) is 221; Smith (U.S. News, 20) is 455; and Bryn Mawr (U.S. News, 30) is 562. (A PayScale spokeswoman said that's because the women's colleges still don't produce enough graduates in engineering, science and technology, the fields that draw the highest salaries.)
The top of the list is dominated by engineering schools, including Harvey Mudd College (16 on the U.S. News ranking of liberal arts colleges, first on PayScale's); the California Institute of Technology (U.S. News, 10; PayScale, 3); Stevens Institute of Technology (U.S. News, 82; tied for third place on PayScale); and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (U.S. News, 7; PayScale, 11). The Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology in Terre Haute, Ind., isn't even ranked by U.S. News but ties for 20 on PayScale -- ahead of the University of Notre Dame (24). The national military academies, as well as the Virginia Military Institute, also rank high on PayScale's list.
PayScale's rankings are just one manifestation of a growing nationwide movement toward quantifying the outcomes of college education based on economic factors like income and employment. The Obama administration wants to rank colleges by tuition, graduation rates, debt and earnings of graduates, and use the rankings to influence federal financial aid to students.
But this can lead to some absurd and potentially alarming conclusions.
In Virginia, the top-ranked college based on graduates' first-year income isn't the nationally known Washington and Lee University, the University of Richmond, the College of William and Mary or even Thomas Jefferson's University of Virginia. It's the Jefferson College of Health Sciences.
"People are desperate to measure something, so they seize on the wrong things," Mark Edmundson, a professor of English at the University of Virginia (PayScale, 76), told me this week. "I'm not against people making a living or prospering. But if the objective of an education is to 'know yourself,' it's going to be hard to measure that."
Professor Edmundson is author of the recent book "Why Teach? In Defense of a Real Education," which argues that education should transform students by challenging and expanding their conceptions of themselves. "Self-realization doesn't just mean sitting around discussing Plato and Socrates," he said. "It means figuring out what job or profession would I be best at and what I would enjoy. Too many people are just aiming for a high salary. They struggle through college, they don't like their classes, they don't like their job and they end up failing. If they had taken the time to discover themselves, they might have ended up happy and prosperous."
Andrew Delbanco, director of American studies at Columbia University (PayScale, 54) and author of "College, What Was, Is, and Should Be," said: "It's understandable and entirely legitimate that students and families are worrying about the 'return' on their investment in college -- especially as tuition continues to rise too high and too fast. But there are lots of troubling questions that follow. Should returns in dollars be the only measure of educational value? What does that say about the traditional mission of college to educate young people for engaged citizenship, and to provide opportunities for self-fulfillment in ways that do not necessarily line up with income and status?"
Professor Delbanco added that a focus on prospective income to the exclusion of other values "runs a high risk of distorting the college itself and pushing it to become a referral or employment agency even more than it already is."
Even the president of top-ranked Harvey Mudd, Maria Klawe, sounded a cautionary note. "We're proud we're getting the recognition, but it has very little to do with what we do." She noted that Mudd students were required to take 30 percent of their course in the humanities, social sciences or arts, which she said was the highest for any engineering and technology school in the country. Mudd's demanding curriculum and tough grading standards mean "our students aren't picking us for the salaries. They could study at a much less rigorous place and earn the same salaries."
Still, she acknowledged that "parents are relieved their offspring will earn something." She said the median starting salary for last year's graduates who took jobs was $77,500, and 23 graduates, or more than 10 percent of the graduating class, had six-figure starting salaries. Dr. Klawe said that a few years ago, a student landed a $280,000 starting salary after designing a high-speed trading algorithm during his summer internship.
Robert Morse, the director of data research for U.S. News, who is in charge of compiling the college rankings, said it currently did not include income data because it did not consider the data adequately comprehensive or reliable. (PayScale says its rankings are based on data from 1.4 million college graduates.) Should that change -- if, for example, the Obama administration requires comprehensive nationwide reporting -- U.S. News would use it in the rankings, Mr. Morse said.
"People are investing a lot of money in a four-year degree, in some cases $240,000, and they're entitled to know what they can expect when they finish," he said. "But you have to be very careful how you analyze the data. Just because Harvey Mudd produces science, engineering and technology graduates who get high salaries, does that make it the best school in America? How do you value teaching and other fields valuable to society that aren't paid nearly as much?"
Even proponents of income-based rankings concede that that is just one of many dimensions to consider when choosing a college. Katie Bardaro, lead economist for PayScale's survey, said that the company always made that point. "But prospective students need to consider their potential career success with a degree from that school," she said. "Jobs are harder and harder to come by, student debt is huge, and the costs of schools are rising faster than inflation. We don't see this changing anytime soon."
Mark Schneider, president of College Measures, a venture that is compiling salary data based on both college and field of study and making it available on its Web site, said that "students should choose a college and a career for many reasons, but we believe income data should be in the mix." He added: "If you go to Harvard or Yale, more power to you. But most students go to schools no one has ever heard of. They don't graduate with a great Rolodex. They don't have family wealth behind them. They need to know the likely outcome about the degree and the school they're choosing. This is their one shot and it had better be something that gets them a well-paying job."
Richard Ekman, president of the Council of Independent Colleges, which represents 600 private colleges and universities, said he had concerns "about the simplistic use of any of these indicators." Income data "may be helpful, but no indicator alone should be determinative," he said. "How do you measure the value of graduate school, the Peace Corps or Teach for America, all of which are low-paying? It's scary to see some public official seize on these metrics as the be-all and end-all."
And he vigorously disputed the notion that a liberal arts education should be reserved for the 1 percent. "Private education isn't just for wealthy people or an elite," he said. In part, thanks to aggressive scholarship programs, "the track record for private colleges that admit lots of first-generation and low-income kids is much better than most state universities."
Professor Edmundson agreed that class distinctions were a red herring, and said that even vocational programs would benefit from courses in the humanities. "Everyone by virtue of being a human being should have a right to think about who they are and what might make them successful," he said.
And he challenged the idea that choosing a college or major based on a projected high salary was a sure path to security. "There's a parental myth that at a certain point you can relax and enjoy your golden years if your child is settled and has a stable job in a profession that will bring them a high income. But the truth is, no one is ever settled, disasters can happen, institutions can collapse and even high-paying jobs go away."
His own son, he noted, a recent graduate of the University of Virginia, is working in a bicycle shop and writing a novel.
Correction: September 18, 2013, Wednesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A chart on Saturday with the Common Sense column, about rating colleges and universities on the basis of their graduates' salaries, omitted two institutions from U.S. News & World Report's 2013 list of the top 10 national universities and liberal arts colleges. Haverford College was tied with Claremont McKenna and Davidson for No. 9 on the U.S. News list for liberal arts colleges, and Dartmouth College was tied with the California Institute of Technology for No. 10 on the university list.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Consumer confidence ebbed early this month and retail sales advanced just slightly in August, the latest indications of a lack of momentum in the economy.
The sluggish pace of activity was underscored by another report on Friday showing an energy-led rise in wholesale prices last month, but subdued underlying inflation pressures.
The soft data, however, was unlikely to deter the Federal Reserve from cutting its huge bond-buying program as early as next week, analysts said.
"I don't think that's a red flag for the Fed. Over all, the data picture is mixed and supports our view that it will be a light taper," said Thomas Costerg, a United States economist at Standard Chartered Bank in New York.
The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan index of consumer sentiment fell 5.3 points to 76.8 in early September, the lowest since April. Economists pointed to worries over high interest rates and a possible military strike on Syria.
A separate report from the Commerce Department showed that retail sales rose 0.2 percent last month as Americans bought automobiles and other long-lasting goods like furniture and electronics and appliances.
But those purchases appeared to draw spending power away from other areas, and receipts for clothing, building materials and sporting goods all fell.
It was the fifth consecutive monthly rise in retail sales, which account for about 30 percent of consumer spending. They had gained 0.4 percent in July, and economists polled had expected them to rise 0.4 percent last month.
In a third report, the Labor Department said the Producer Price Index increased 0.3 percent last month after being flat in July.
"Price pressures are not dead, but they are taking a very long and heavy nap," said Michael Montgomery, a United States economist at IHS Global Insight.

Full text:   SAN FRANCISCO -- FOR as long as most of us can remember, the nation's energy news has trended from bad to worse, starting with the oil crises of the 1970s. But today, the good news is that our energy productivity and security are better than they have been in decades.
You'd never know it by listening to those who say our energy security requires construction of the massive Keystone XL pipeline, or a new surge of oil and gas drilling, or a nuclear power renaissance, or all of the above. And while "all of the above" has emerged as the favored national energy policy of both parties, fortunately that is not the focus of President Obama's promising climate action plan.
He has given top priority instead to our most productive and lowest-cost option: the "energy efficiency resources" that come from getting more out of oil, natural gas and electricity with increasingly efficient equipment and vehicles, used more carefully.
Government data indicate that our energy-saving efforts already have yielded some amazingly good news. Our factories and businesses are producing substantially more products and value with less energy, which goes to the heart of the president's climate strategy. In fact, energy use in the United States has been dropping since 2007, and last year's total was below the 1999 level, even though the economy grew by more than 25 percent from 1999 to 2012, adjusted for inflation.
At the same time, the amount of oil we are using in our vehicles, homes and businesses continued to decline last year, down 14 percent from a peak in 2005. Surprisingly, oil use was lower in 2012 than in 1973 (when the nation's economy was only about a third of its current size). The main reason is that we are demanding better mileage from our vehicles and driving them less.
These remarkable trends began decades ago. Without trying too hard, over the past 40 years we found so many innovative ways to save energy that we more than doubled the economic productivity of our oil, natural gas and electricity.
Moreover, efficiency's contribution to meeting the nation's overall energy needs over that period exceeded that of all fossil and nuclear resources combined, according to a recent study by the Bipartisan Policy Center, a result of 18 months of work by a panel that included me as well as prominent industry representatives.
Total energy use per dollar of goods produced is down, as are gasoline use per mile driven, cost of energy services (from lighting to refrigeration) and greenhouse gases emitted. These reductions are saving hundreds of billions of dollars every year. They are helping American workers and companies compete worldwide. And they are making our country more secure.
With numerous studies uncovering vast untapped energy efficiency savings, there are several critical steps we should now take. First, the federal and state governments must keep tightening efficiency standards for buildings, equipment and vehicles. This also means ensuring that the administration follows through with its recent commitment to end what my organization and a number of states contend are unlawful delays in releasing standards already approved by the Department of Energy. Second, the Environmental Protection Agency must reduce carbon dioxide emissions from new and existing power plants by adopting standards that recognize the contribution energy efficiency can make to reducing such pollution.
In addition, state regulators should reward utilities for helping residential, business and industrial customers use energy more efficiently, and stop the widespread practice of penalizing utilities when their sales level off or decline because customers are using less energy. When regulators set rates, they establish targets for utilities' allowable revenues, and this unintentionally links the companies' financial health to robust sales of electricity and natural gas. The problem can be solved if regulators allow modest annual rate adjustments that correct for any unexpected changes in utility sales.
Half the states have instituted such "decoupling" systems for at least some of their investor-owned natural gas and electric utilities, but the process is taking too long and only one publicly owned utility, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, has adopted these reforms. The rest should step up.
When it comes to our personal and government energy budgets, we must focus on achieving still more energy savings that cost (and pollute) far less than the electricity, natural gas and oil we won't need as a result. There are so many steps we can take, ranging from upgrading our light bulbs and insulation to retrofitting our homes and buildings with new energy-saving products and appliances. Most utilities have become good sources of information and financial incentives for interested customers.
For 40 years now, energy efficiency has been America's most productive energy resource. In a nation and world with funding constraints, an "all of the above" energy policy that threatens the environment is a guarantee of costly disappointment. As the president knows, it is far better to give priority to efficiency improvements that cost less than the energy they displace.

Abstract: Mr. Bernanke and his allies also face mounting pressure from internal critics who worry the modest benefits of asset purchases increasingly are outweighed by the risk that continued expansion of the Fed's holdings will disrupt financial markets -- by encouraging speculation, by limiting the availability of some kinds of securities or by seeding inflation.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve officials, who have made clear that they intend to cut back on the Fed's monthly asset purchases by the end of the year, must decide next week whether it is time to tap the brakes or better to wait another month or two.
The far thornier challenge they face is convincing markets that the Fed remains committed to its broader effort to stimulate the economy even as it begins to pull back from the most visible component of that campaign -- and even though as many as nine of the 12 voting members of the Fed's policy-making committee may be replaced in the next year.
Most notably, Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed's chairman, is expected to step down at the end of January; the person President Obama is widely expected to nominate in his place, Lawrence H. Summers, has said little about monetary policy in recent years.
Fed officials are concerned that the markets will misinterpret the introduction of tapering, as the impending move is popularly known, as a sign of a broader retreat. They are expected to discuss ways of reinforcing the Fed's continuing determination to encourage economic activity and job creation when the Federal Open Market Committee meets here Tuesday and Wednesday.
"The overwhelming incentive at this meeting is to dull the hawkish effects of tapering with more dovish communication," wrote Eric Green, head of rates, foreign exchange and commodities research at TD Securities. The Fed's message, he said, "has been ill defined and not internally consistent. The good news is that the F.O.M.C. has the opportunity to improve on that message."
The Fed under Mr. Bernanke has struggled for much of the last five years to find new ways of stimulating the economy beyond its base-line commitment since December 2008 to hold short-term interest rates near zero.
Last year, officials announced an aggressive combination of asset purchases and forward guidance, both tied to improvement in the labor market. The Fed said it would buy $85 billion a month in Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities to jump-start job growth, and keep short-term rates near zero at least as long as the unemployment rate was above 6.5 percent. It was 7.3 percent in August.
In June, however, Mr. Bernanke surprised many investors by announcing that the Fed intended to reduce the volume of monthly purchases by the end of the year, and to end the purchases entirely by the middle of next year. An official account of the committee's most recent meeting in July affirmed that "almost all participants" favored Mr. Bernanke's timetable, provided that "economic conditions improved broadly as expected."
Investors have started to demand higher interest rates, driving up borrowing costs, and critics warn the Fed is pulling back too soon. The unemployment rate is down from 8.1 percent in August 2012, just before the Fed started the expansion of its bond portfolio. But roughly half the decline happened because more adults were not even trying to find jobs. The share of adults with jobs, down sharply during the recession, has yet to recover any of its losses.
Fed officials have emphasized in response that their policy decisions are forward-looking. Changes in monetary policy seep slowly through the economy -- from the Fed through the banks into the decision-making of business and individual borrowers -- and Fed officials have said they are convinced the economy will not need as much help in the next few years.
Mr. Bernanke and his allies also face mounting pressure from internal critics who worry the modest benefits of asset purchases increasingly are outweighed by the risk that continued expansion of the Fed's holdings will disrupt financial markets -- by encouraging speculation, by limiting the availability of some kinds of securities or by seeding inflation.
Many analysts predict that proponents of bond buying, also known as quantitative easing, will agree to cut the volume of monthly purchases initially by a small amount, perhaps as little as $10 billion.
"Concerns about the cost of Q.E. have reached a tipping point for the F.O.M.C., and Q.E. tapering will start even though the economic recovery remains tepid," wrote Kevin Logan, chief United States economist at HSBC Securities. Mr. Logan had predicted the change would happen in December, but said comments by Fed officials persuaded him September was more likely.
A small reduction in bond purchases should have little economic impact, but investors took Mr. Bernanke's comments in June as evidence the Fed might begin to raise rates sooner than they had expected.
The Fed has sought to stimulate the economy by persuading investors to trust that rates will remain near zero for years to come. Inevitably, investors are skittish about any sign that the Fed may change its mind. And uncertainty about the Fed's plans has been compounded by the impending shake-up of the Fed's policy-making committee.
Four of the 12 voters on the Fed's policy-making committee are replaced each year through a rotation of the presidents of the regional reserve banks. Unusually, as many as five of the seven governors may also be replaced.
Elizabeth A. Duke stepped down at the end of August. Sarah Bloom Raskin has been nominated as deputy Treasury secretary. Jerome H. Powell's term ends at the same time as Mr. Bernanke's, although the White House might decide to leave Mr. Powell, a Republican, in place. And Janet L. Yellen, the Fed's vice chairwoman, is seen as unlikely to remain if she is passed over in favor of Mr. Summers.
Fed officials have discussed a number of options to reassure investors. The Fed has said it intends to hold short-term rates near zero at least as long as unemployment remains above 6.5 percent and inflation remains under control. Narayana Kocherlakota, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, wants to reduce the threshold to 5.5 percent. Other Fed officials, seeking to preserve flexibility, prefer the softer approach of emphasizing that 6.5 percent is a threshold, not a target.
"I can easily envision certain circumstances in which the unemployment rate could go below 6 percent before we moved the funds rate up," Charles Evans, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said in a speech earlier this month.
Esther George, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, suggested the Fed should address how quickly it expects to raise rates once that process begins, by estimating the level of future short-term rates.
"Markets and the public are likely having a difficult time understanding exactly how fast the F.O.M.C. is likely to raise interest rates after the first rate hike," she said.

Full text:   CARACAS, Venezuela -- When a sweeping power failure left more than half the country without electricity last week, President Nicolás Maduro wasted no time issuing a verdict. Despite a strained power grid that has gone lacking in basic upkeep for years, he assured Venezuelans that there could be only one cause: sabotage.
Then on Monday, when officials released a long-awaited report on the explosion at the national oil company's enormous Amuay refinery, which killed more than 40 people last year, the conclusion surprised no one: sabotage again.
Accusing unseen conspirators of subjecting the nation to a variety of ills is an art form in Venezuela, honed during the 14-year presidency of Hugo Chávez, who died in March.
But ever since Mr. Maduro was elected by a narrow margin in April to replace Mr. Chávez, his mentor, he has cranked the discourse of conspiracy to an ever higher pitch, darkly warning of plots that seem to lurk around nearly every corner, aimed at killing him, destroying the economy or wrecking Mr. Chávez's socialist-inspired revolution.
Few people are ever arrested and none have been convicted of any of the schemes Mr. Maduro has warned of in recent months.
Still, he makes it clear who he holds responsible: his political opposition and the United States, which he paints as an imperial enemy bent on subjugating Venezuela.
And for many Venezuelans, the allegations seem credible, especially because the United States once gave tacit approval for a coup that briefly removed Mr. Chávez from office.
On Monday, Mr. Maduro held a news conference where he riffed at length on his favorite themes, linking the alleged sabotage at the refinery to assassination plots, the electrical blackout, conspiring capitalists and supposed intrigues originating in the White House.
Mr. Maduro complained about the skepticism of his critics, who say he uses the frequent warnings of conspiracy as a scare tactic to generate support.
"Can it be that they want to see the cadaver with four bullets in it?" he said, knocking on a wooden table to ward off bad luck. "That's the proof they want to see."
Mr. Maduro said the refinery explosion in August 2012, which was caused by a gas leak, was carried out to disrupt the country before an election last October in which Mr. Chávez was re-elected, suggesting that it was done at the prompting of the American Embassy. The country's enemies are also plotting to bring down the economy, he said.
Venezuela is struggling with inflation that is running at more than 45 percent a year, with chronic shortages of staple foods and basic consumer goods in the stores. Many economists say that government price controls and a lack of dollars to pay for imports are causing those problems.
But Mr. Maduro insisted that they were the result of a "war against the economy," saying that he had the names of businessmen who were conspiring to further reduce the supply of some products, aiming to cause "a calamitous situation" this fall.
He also claimed to have information of a meeting in the White House in late July in which officials from the State Department, the National Security Agency, the C.I.A. and the Pentagon came up with a plan called "Total Collapse" intended to destabilize Venezuela.
"There could be people who think that this is fantasy," Mr. Maduro said. Invoking Salvador Allende, the leftist Chilean president who was overthrown in 1973 after concerted American attempts to undermine him, he said, "It is raw reality."
Mr. Maduro's fiery words create the impression that he is surrounded on all sides by enemies who want to take away the social programs and other benefits provided by his government to the poor.
"Of course it was sabotage," Jesús Lira, a vegetable seller, said of the refinery explosion and blackout. "And the government should come down hard on the opposition for it."
But critics point out that while the government is heavy on accusations there are rarely arrests. No one has been arrested in the refinery explosion or last week's blackout.
All that has led to a kind of conspiracy overload in which many people shrug their shoulders at the most strident assertions of impending doom or dastardly evildoing.
"You've got to wonder, how many saboteurs there are in the country," Alberto Barrera Tyszka, a journalist and novelist, wrote in a newspaper column on Sunday.
"They are everywhere, they appear in every circumstance, at any time." He added, "Conspirators are the frothy solution to every problem."

Abstract: In May, to little fanfare, the Obama administration published new estimates of the "social cost of carbon," a dollars-and-cents measure of the future damage -- from floods, pandemics, depressed agricultural productivity -- that releasing each additional ton of heat-trapping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere would cost.

In May, to little fanfare, the Obama administration published new estimates of the "social cost of carbon," a dollars-and-cents measure of the future damage -- from floods, pandemics, depressed agricultural productivity -- that releasing each additional ton of heat-trapping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere would cost.
The new numbers are likely to be more important than the low-key announcement would imply. They suggest climate change could cause substantially more economic harm than the government previously believed. But they also suggest there is a legitimate debate to be had about the cost of preventing it from getting worse.
Perhaps the most startling conclusion to be drawn from the new estimates is that the sacrifice demanded of our generation to prevent vast climate change down the road may turn out to be rather small.
The typical passenger car emits a ton of CO2 in about two and a half months of driving. Under one set of assumptions, the government's number-crunchers determined that the damage caused by an additional ton of CO2 spewed into the air in 2015 would amount to $65 in today's money. That's 50 percent more than was estimated just three years ago.
This could justify fairly aggressive policies to slow emissions of CO2. A tax of $65 per ton of CO2 to force polluters to pay for the damage would add $0.56 to a gallon of gas. Exxon, say, might have to shell out $8.1 billion to cover the 125 million tons of CO2 it spewed last year. Farms might have to pay $35 billion.
Under a different set of assumptions, though, the social cost of carbon came out to only $13.50 a ton. This would amount to a gas tax of less than $0.12. Considering the fierce debate over what to do about climate change, this does not seem like that much money at all.
Interestingly, the main source of the vast discrepancy between the two figures is not a disagreement about the future damages of warming.
A 2009 review of the dozen or so existing estimates, by Richard Tol, professor of the economics of climate change at Vrije University in Amsterdam, found that studies using very different methodologies still roughly agreed on the magnitude of the impact.
Most cost estimates clustered between 1 and 2 percent of the world's gross domestic product (estimated at about $85 trillion today), if temperatures were to increase 2.5 degrees Celsius (4.5 degrees Fahrenheit) above the preindustrial era. A more recent estimate by William D. Nordhaus of Yale, the foremost American economist studying climate change, concluded that allowing uncontrolled carbon emissions would raise temperatures above the preindustrial era by 3.4 degrees Celsius (6.1 degrees Fahrenheit) by the end of the century and cost the world 2.8 percent of G.D.P. in 2095.
If damages were higher than expected, the government said the social cost of carbon could rise sharply -- to a whopping $123 per ton of CO2.
The discrepancy between the estimates of the value of climate damage stem from radically different views on how much weight the people of the present should give to damages caused by the climate in the distant future.
The estimate of $65 a ton is inspired by a moral stance: if warming will impose a cost of 1 percent of the world's income in the future, we should spend about 1 percent of our income to prevent it -- or perhaps somewhat less to account for the trend that people 100 years from now are likely to be much richer than people today.
By contrast, $13.50 a ton comes from the business world. Essentially, it requires that spending to prevent climate change should yield at least the same rate of return, in terms of reduced damages from warming, as any other capital investment.
The two outlooks lead to entirely different decisions. The government's rendition of the moral approach implies that it is worth making every investment to reduce carbon emissions that has a rate of return of at least 2.5 percent, in terms of avoided damages. Businesss logic suggests that no investment should be made if the return -- after taxes -- is less than 5 percent.
The moralist would try to keep the atmosphere from warming more than 2 degrees above its temperature in the preindustrial era, the agreed-upon target at the United Nations climate summit in Copenhagen four years ago. The executive would not, noting that aiming for this goal would cost trillions more than it saved.
Think of it this way: Demanding a 5 percent return means that a dollar invested today should become at least $1.05 next year after inflation, and a little more than $1.10 the year after that. In 200 years it should be worth at least $17,292.58. Turn the logic around and we should spend $1 today to prevent climate-related damage only if it prevents damages of at least $17,292.58 two centuries down the road.
The moralist's bar is much lower. At 2.5 percent, spending $1 today would be justified if it prevented merely $139.56 worth of damage in 200 years.
The debate over climate change has none of this subtlety. Senate Republicans railed against the new numbers in June, taking the opportunity to signal their skepticism about the "claims of catastrophic global warming."
The United States Chamber of Commerce threw its weight behind an amendment to an energy bill that passed the Republican-controlled House barring the Environmental Protection Agency from using the numbers in cost-benefit analyses to justify new regulations.
But for all the fury of the response, the new estimates from the Obama administration suggest that the burden American citizens and businesses will be called on to shoulder is likely to be modest -- because business logic is likely to prevail.
Multiple challenges compete for the world's resources, from economic development and ending poverty to eradicating AIDS and malaria. The climate is not the world's only priority. Even if we were to agree that improving the well-being of future generations is worth an enormous investment, there might be better things to invest in than reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
Most of Bangladesh is less than 33 feet above sea level. Millions of poor farmers on its alluvial plains would welcome investments to prevent melting polar ice caps and rising sea levels. But many would also welcome investments that made them richer and better able to cope with climate change, including jobs outside of agriculture and homes somewhere dry.
As Professor Nordhaus wrote in his 2008 book, "A Question of Balance": "Investments in reducing future climate damages to corn and trees and other areas should compete with investments in better seed, improved rotation and many other high-yield investments." If investments in CO2 abatement are not competitive, we would do better by investing elsewhere and using the proceeds to cover warming's damage. We would still have money left over.
Professor Nordhaus says he prefers a 4 percent discount rate. Using it in "A Question of Balance," he calculates that the optimal carbon tax comes in at around $11 per ton of CO2 in 2010, which is exactly the low end of the administration's estimate of the social cost of carbon.
Using it wouldn't cure the planet. By the year 2100, according to his model, the earth's temperature rises to 3.45 degrees Celsius above its level in the year 1900, and climate-related damages amount to some $17 trillion. Still, compared with doing nothing it would yield a $3 trillion return. That, he says, is the best we can do.
But the most compelling argument that business logic will prevail has little to do with its merits. It's simply that the world's decision-makers are following it. Four years after committing to a 2-degree ceiling, the world's current policies will lead us, by the end of the century, to blow past 3.

Full text:   The stock market moved sharply higher on Monday, with the Nasdaq composite index ending at its highest since September 2000, after upbeat data from China increased optimism about the health of the global economy.
Investor sentiment was also lifted by merger activity and easing concern about a potential American military strike on Syria.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed higher for a fifth straight session, posting its best daily performance since Aug. 1, while all 10 S.& P. sectors ended higher. More than 70 percent of companies that trade on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq exchange posted gains.
Basic materials shares led the day's gains, rising 1.5 percent, after China's August exports handily beat market expectations while consumer inflation there held steady. United States Steel shares jumped 66 cents, or 3.5 percent, to $19.53, while Alcoa rose 16 cents, or 2 percent, to $8.08.
"This is more proof that the Chinese government's attempts to stabilize the country's economy are helping, and that really got us up and running," said Donald Selkin, chief market strategist at National Securities.
Equities added to their gains in afternoon trading as it appeared less likely that a resolution authorizing military strikes against Syria would be approved easily by Congress.
Geopolitical uncertainty related to Syria has been a major market driver in recent weeks, with investors especially concerned about the potential impact on the oil market.
Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada and the majority leader, scheduled a test vote for later this week, but it was unclear whether the measure would attract enough backing to clear anticipated procedural roadblocks.
"Every poll shows it would be very difficult for Obama to get authorization, and that might be enough to delay any action or at least make the action more cautious," Mr. Selkin said. "Both of those would give the market a leg up."
Separately, a Russian proposal to place Syria's chemical weapons under international control was welcomed by the government in Damascus, which praised the Kremlin for seeking to "prevent American aggression."
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 140.62 points, or 0.94 percent, to 15,063.12. The S.& P. 500 gained 16.54 points, or 1 percent, to 1,671.71. The Nasdaq picked up 46.17 points, or 1.26 percent, to 3,706.18.
Deal news gave a further lift to market confidence.
Koch Industries agreed to buy the electronic connectors maker Molex for about $7.2 billion.
Ares Management and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board reached a deal to buy the privately owned luxury retailer Neiman Marcus for $6 billion.
Molex shares surged $9.29, or 31.7 percent, to $38.63 as the S.& P.'s top gainer.
Shares of home builders rallied as investors bet that the rise in mortgage rates was nearly over. Pulte Group stock added $1.16, or 7.5 percent, to $16.63.
In the bond market, interest rates eased. The price of the Treasury's 10-year note rose 6/32, to 96 15/32, while its yield dipped to 2.91 percent, from 2.93 percent late Friday.

Full text:   TARGET-DATE funds are all intended to do the same thing: reduce stock market risk incrementally the closer you get to your retirement target date. But that does not mean the funds, known as T.D.F.'s, are entirely adequate for every rainy-day situation. They could flip up in a strong financial wind.
Holding a fixed number of mutual funds, T.D.F.'s are sold as a no-brainer default solution. They have gained in popularity and hold nearly a half-trillion dollars in assets, up from $71 billion in 2005, according to the Investment Company Institute. They are sold by most major mutual fund groups and are becoming mainstays in 401(k)-type plans.
Yet T.D.F.'s may not be ideally suited to every retirement investor, particularly those near or in retirement. You have to look inside each plan and vet it carefully to see if it is right for you.
All the funds have a "glide path" to the target date. That means the allocation will shift to more bonds and fewer stocks as the date gets closer. If you hope to retire in 2030, for example, a fund might have 30 percent stocks and 70 percent bonds by that year.
Critics of this autopilot approach say it may concentrate too much risk in one asset class or not offer enough growth for those who will live 20 to 30 years past conventional retirement age.
Lynne Strynchuk, a certified financial planner at Moisand Fitzgerald Tamayo in Melbourne, Fla., said she would recommend T.D.F.'s only if her clients had no other retirement money to invest and "they have a 401(k) that has only target-date funds" that left them with no other choice.
Like many, she said she had found that the glide paths did not work for everyone and varied, depending upon the chosen fund company. While she likes the diversification the funds offer, the expenses may be too high and the allocations too conservative.
"The funds may get you to retirement," she said, emphasizing that they may still not get you through retirement.
For example, the Vanguard Target Retirement 2030 fund has 77 percent of its assets in stocks, with the rest in bonds and cash (as of June 29). In contrast, the Fidelity Freedom 2030 fund, has about 61 percent in stocks, just under 26 percent in bonds and 7 percent in a commodity fund.
How do you decide which is better? While each will reduce stock holdings as it approaches your target date, there is no guaranteed return and they will react differently to market conditions.
Funds heavily invested in bond funds near the target date will be highly sensitive to inflation and interest-rate movements; bonds lose value when yields rise. And if yields remain low, they may not keep up with inflation.
Then there is the longevity bonus, which trips up much of the logic behind T.D.F.'s. Women in the United States at age 65 may live, on average, another 20 years, men almost 18, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Millions will reach their 10th and 11th decades.
Someone who lives to 100 will need some growth to beat inflation and cover out-of-pocket health care costs, which most pundits agree will be higher in the future. A mostly government bond portfolio yielding around 2 percent will not do that. That means most T.D.F.'s that fixate on high bond allocations at 65 may not provide enough stocks-based growth for a longer life span.
Ms. Strynchuk said it was good that fund managers "at least look to the future," adding, "But they ignore all the client-subjective variables along the way, such as a client's age, health, risk tolerance, savings, tax situation, job security, and of course, other investments."
Craig Israelsen, a principal at Target Date Analytics, which analyzes and benchmarks T.D.F.'s, said that for someone 55 or older, a target-date fund involved a number of questions. Do you have other retirement savings, like a guaranteed pension? Will the T.D.F. mix skew your total portfolio toward one asset and concentrate risk in the stocks or bonds? How is your health? How much risk do you want to take? Age is a factor but not the only one.
"A 25-year-old needs a portfolio that is primarily equity-based," Mr. Israelsen said. "Forty years away from the target date, most investors are in the same boat, which is why T.D.F.'s that are 40 years away from the target date are virtually identical. Older investors who are closer to the target date can be very different, which is why target date funds might be too generic for their specific financial situation at that point."
Expenses are also worth vetting. While average expenses have come down in recent years -- to 1.07 percent in 2012, from 1.23 percent annually in 2008, according to the Investment Company Institute -- they are no bargain. You can find a retail, broad-basket United States stock fund like the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index ETF for as little as 0.05 percent annually. As with any "fund of funds," you are paying for the packaging and allocation features.
Other considerations include whether you really intend to retire by the target date. You may choose or need to keep working and may be able to take more risk. Some investors want an even-higher allocation to stocks than the glide path permits, particularly if they have more job security.
Most of all, target-date funds are not to be confused with guaranteed vehicles that will produce a lump sum. They can lose money, as they did in 2008.
"Survey data shows that people think they'll get their money back," said Helaine Olen, author of "Pound Foolish: Exposing the Dark Side of the Personal Finance Industry." "We know that's not true."
Choosing a fund by the target date is not going to help much in your decision. You have to take a close look at what kinds of funds they hold and how the glide path changes over time. Also ask whether the fund is aimed at getting you to retirement, then staying at a static mix, or getting you through retirement with an income-focused allocation.
If the initial or ending combination bulks up too much on stocks or bonds for your risk tolerance -- or cannot beat inflation -- you may need to step away and pick individual mutual or exchange-traded funds that more closely match what you need to do.

Farm Subsidies for Nonfarmers May Continue as Lawmakers Deadlock Again

Abstract: According to the Agriculture Department, adjusting for inflation, five of the highest farm income years since 1976 have occurred within the last few years since 2004.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- There are no farms in the city of Columbus, the capital of Ohio. Yet nearly 500 people living there received about $1.1 million in farm subsidies last year.
They had plenty of company.
Far from the nation's fields of wheat and corn, more than 18,000 people who live in the 54 largest American cities, including New York, Los Angeles and Washington, received about $24 million in farm subsidies last year, according to a report to be released Tuesday by the Environmental Working Group, a Washington research organization.
Known as direct payments, the subsidies are given each year to farmers and farmland owners whether they grow crops or not. They were supposed to be eliminated in farm bills introduced in the House and Senate, but they were continued last year when Congress extended the most recent farm bill -- passed in 2008 -- after efforts to pass a new bill stalled.
This year both the House and Senate have passed farm bills eliminating the payments, but progress has again slowed over fights about the food stamp program, which makes up about 80 percent of the farm bill. Conservative lawmakers are seeking large cuts in food stamps, but many Democrats are opposed.
So with just a few weeks left before the end of the fiscal year, it appears that Congress may again either extend the current farm bill or let hundreds of farm programs expire. An extension means another year of farm subsidies.
"Once again it looks like the government will be sending out billions of dollars of subsidies to people who don't grow anything and don't even live on a farm," said Scott Faber, vice president for government affairs at the Environmental Working Group.
Direct payments have long been controversial. Created in 1996 as a temporary measure, they cost taxpayers about $5 billion a year and can go to people who don't live on farms, although they have to be "actively engaged" in farming. A Government Accountability Office report released last year found that recipients at 2,300 farms had grown no crops at all for the past five years, and that 622 had grown no crops for a decade.
Many farmers have defended the payments, saying they are needed to get them through rough patches when prices dip sharply. But as farm income has risen to record levels, even some farm groups say the payments are harder to defend. According to the Agriculture Department, adjusting for inflation, five of the highest farm income years since 1976 have occurred within the last few years since 2004.
The Obama administration has called for elimination of the payments, saying the billions saved could be used to reduce the deficit.
And even though the American Farm Bureau Federation, the nation's largest farming organization, said it still supported the idea of direct payments, the group said it would not oppose Congressional actions to eliminate the payments. "Our board has determined that we are not going to oppose eliminating the payments as long as it is reinvested into the farm safety net," said Dale Moore, executive director for public policy at the Farm Bureau.
As written, the farm bills passed this year by the House and Senate would use some of the money saved from direct payments to increase financing for crop insurance, a federally subsidized program that pays 62 percent of the premiums for farmers and covers decreases in crop yields or revenue.
"In these trying budgetary times, it makes no sense to pay farmers who haven't suffered a loss," said Senator Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan and chairwoman of the Senate Agriculture Committee. "Under new reforms passed in the new farm bill, you will have to farm to receive money from the safety net."

Full text:   India's once booming economy is sliding into a deep slump. The country grew just 4.4 percent this summer, a far cry from the 7.7 percent average for the past decade. Its currency, the rupee, has tumbled 16 percent against the dollar in the last three months. And analysts expect things to get even worse in the coming months.
Like Indonesia, Brazil and other developing countries, India has been hurt as investors have moved money to the United States to take advantage of the prospect of higher interest rates. But most of India's biggest problems -- like its high inflation, which was nearly 5.8 percent in July and has been rising partly because of the falling rupee -- have domestic causes. Until the coalition government led by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh reforms the country's economy, India will fall far short of its potential.
During the global financial boom of the mid-2000s, investors indiscriminately dumped cash into fast-growing countries and India's shortcomings were easily overlooked. The financial crisis forced investors to pay more attention to fundamental problems in emerging markets. Analysts and business executives say the country has become even less hospitable in recent years. In the nine years that the coalition government has been in power, several ministers have resigned in corruption scandals; large infrastructure projects have been delayed by mismanagement; the government's budget deficit has ballooned, thanks to wasteful spending like subsidies for diesel fuel; and politics have thwarted reforms in labor and education.
Mr. Singh has been an ineffectual leader without much authority. The real power is held by his political patron, Sonia Gandhi, who leads the Indian National Congress Party, which has expressed little concern for the country's ailing economy.
Sadly, most analysts expect Ms. Gandhi and Mr. Singh to make no politically difficult changes -- like privatizing bloated state-owned enterprises or easing counterproductive regulations and delays on public infrastructure projects -- until after national elections next year.
As the economy slows, India's poor suffer most. Many have lost jobs in hard-hit sectors like construction and manufacturing. They are also seeing their meager incomes eroded by rising food costs. One change that would help is for government to provide welfare payments directly to families instead of funneling subsidized food grains, fuel and other commodities through corrupt officials who siphon off up to 60 percent of the benefits. In Brazil and Mexico, direct transfers to the poor have helped reduce poverty and cut down on corruption and waste.
The new governor of India's central bank, Raghuram Rajan, a respected economist, can also help by pushing through delayed reforms to make the country's financial industry more competitive by, for instance, granting licenses to new banks. But unlike the Federal Reserve, the Reserve Bank of India is subject to significant political meddling, which could limit how far Mr. Rajan can go.
In 1991, when the country was facing a financial crisis and had to pledge its gold reserves for an emergency loan, the Indian government pushed through landmark economic reforms like freeing businesses to produce as much as they wanted without seeking government approval. The situation is not as dire today, but the country needs solutions that are just as far-reaching.

Abstract: The General Administration of Customs in Beijing said on Sunday that China's surplus reached $28.52 billion last month, the highest level since last December, as exports accelerated. Because China is the world's largest exporter and often the first large country to release trade data each month, its trade figures are a widely watched barometer not only for the health of China's large export sector but also of the global economy.

Full text:   HONG KONG -- China's trade surplus rose in August to its highest level this year, while inflation remained under control, government data released on Sunday and Monday showed, in further signs that the Chinese economy and possibly the global economy are faring a little better as the summer ends.
The General Administration of Customs in Beijing said on Sunday that China's surplus reached $28.52 billion last month, the highest level since last December, as exports accelerated. Because China is the world's largest exporter and often the first large country to release trade data each month, its trade figures are a widely watched barometer not only for the health of China's large export sector but also of the global economy.
Two other worries about China -- inflation at the consumer level that might fan public discontent or deflation at the producer level that might prompt companies to stop investing -- seemed to be allayed at least temporarily as well by Monday morning's data.
The National Bureau of Statistics announced that consumer prices were only up 2.6 percent in August from a year earlier, compared to a 2.7 percent increase in July. At the same time, deflation slowed in producer prices, which fell only 1.6 percent in August after tumbling 2.3 percent in July.
The Chinese trade and inflation data, and recent surveys showing more bullish sentiment among purchasing managers in China, are starting to give hope to those who argue that the gloom these days about Asian economies, particularly China's, is excessive.
"China is no longer sliding, the global industrial cycle is ticking up, and, really, how high can rates go with the Fed printing money?" asked Frederic Neumann, the co-head of Asian economic research at HSBC.
To be sure, China still faces high and rising levels of domestic debt, eroding competitiveness because of surging wages and other challenges.
But China's exports last month were up 7.1 percent last month compared to a year earlier, and particularly strong to Southeast Asia, South Korea and Taiwan. China's trade surplus also increased because imports were virtually unchanged for the huge category of reprocessing goods -- items as varied as high-end plastics and computer chips that are imported by China for use in products that are then exported.
The flattening in imports of reprocessing goods reflects a broad move by many multinational companies to shift entire supply chains to mainland China, instead of merely assembling goods there from components manufactured all over the world. That trend toward procuring parts in China persists even as a growing number of export factories in low-wage sectors like garments, toys and furniture are moving to other countries, like Bangladesh, Cambodia and Vietnam.
Excluding reprocessing goods, China's other imports grew strongly in August as lending increased at state-controlled banks. Louis Kuijs, an economist in the Hong Kong office of the Royal Bank of Scotland, said the import data could indicate "continued robust growth in demand and economic activity in China's own economy."
But he cautioned that detailed information on domestic economic activity in China during August, including industrial production, investment in fixed assets and retail sales, was not scheduled for release until Tuesday morning in Beijing.
The trade and inflation data were the latest signs that China has emerged largely unscathed from currency declines and market setbacks seen in many emerging markets this summer.
As money poured in from around the world to buy Chinese goods, China's central bank allowed the renminbi to inch up 0.1 percent against the dollar last month.
"The market turbulence in emerging economies, especially in India and Indonesia, has made Rmb a center of stability," Liu Li-Gang, the chief economist for greater China at the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, said in a research note, using a common abbreviation for the Chinese currency.
While the renminbi's gain last month was tiny, it contrasted with declines among most emerging market currencies, as investors fretted that policy makers at the American central bank will decide at a meeting on Sept. 18 to begin slowing the pace of a program of asset purchases. That could cause interest rates in the United States to climb further, making investments there more attractive, and reducing the appeal of emerging markets.

Full text:   On Saturday, Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming delivered the weekly Republican address. He ignored Syria, presumably because his party is deeply conflicted on the issue. (For the record, so am I.) Instead, he demanded repeal of the Affordable Care Act. "The health care law," he declared, "has proven to be unpopular, unworkable and unaffordable," and he predicted "sticker shock" in the months ahead.
So, another week, another denunciation of Obamacare. Who cares? But Mr. Barrasso's remarks were actually interesting, although not in the way he intended. You see, all the recent news on health costs has been good. So Mr. Barrasso is predicting sticker shock precisely when serious fears of such a shock are fading fast. Why would he do that?
Well, one likely answer is that he hasn't heard any of the good news. Think about it: Who would tell him?
My guess, in other words, was that Mr. Barrasso was inadvertently illustrating the widening "wonk gap" -- the G.O.P.'s near-complete lack of expertise on anything substantive. Health care is the most prominent example, but the dumbing down extends across the spectrum, from budget issues to national security to poll analysis. Remember, Mitt Romney and much of his party went into Election Day expecting victory.
About health reform: Mr. Barrasso was wrong about everything, even the "unpopular" bit, as I'll explain in a minute. Mainly, however, he was completely missing the story on affordability.
For the truth is that the good news on costs just keeps coming in. There has been a striking slowdown in overall health costs since the Affordable Care Act was enacted, with many experts giving the law at least partial credit. And we now have a good idea what insurance premiums will be once the law goes fully into effect; a comprehensive survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation finds that on average premiums will be significantly lower than those predicted by the Congressional Budget Office when the law was passed.
But do Republican politicians know any of this? Not if they're listening to conservative "experts," who have been offering a steady stream of misinformation. All those claims about sticker shock, for example, come from obviously misleading comparisons. For example, supposed experts compare average insurance rates under the new system, which will cover everyone, with the rates currently paid by a handful of young, healthy people for bare-bones insurance. And they conveniently ignore the subsidies many Americans will receive.
At the same time, in an echo of the Romney camp's polling fantasies, other conservative "experts" are creating false impressions about public opinion. Just after Kaiser released a poll showing a strong majority -- 57 percent -- opposed to the idea of defunding health reform, the Heritage Foundation put out a poster claiming that 57 percent of Americans want reform defunded. Did the experts at Heritage simply read the numbers upside down? No, they claimed, they were referring to some other poll. Whatever really happened, the practical effect was to delude the right-wing faithful.
And the point is that episodes like this have become the rule, not the exception, on the right. How many Republicans know, for example, that government employment has declined, not risen, under President Obama? Certainly Senator Rand Paul was incredulous when I pointed this out to him on TV last fall. On the contrary, he insisted, "the size of growth of government is enormous under President Obama" -- which was completely untrue but was presumably what his sources had told him, knowing that it was what he wanted to hear.
For that, surely, is what the wonk gap is all about. Political conservatism and serious policy analysis can coexist, and there was a time when they did. Back in the 1980s, after all, health experts at Heritage made a good-faith effort to devise a plan for universal health coverage -- and what they came up with was the system now known as Obamacare.
But that was then. Modern conservatism has become a sort of cult, very much given to conspiracy theorizing when confronted with inconvenient facts. Liberal policies were supposed to cause hyperinflation, so low measured inflation must reflect statistical fraud; the threat of climate change implies the need for public action, so global warming must be a gigantic scientific hoax. Oh, and Mitt Romney would have won if only he had been a real conservative.
It's all kind of funny, in a way. Unfortunately, however, this runaway cult controls the House, which gives it immense destructive power -- the power, for example, to wreak havoc on the economy by refusing to raise the debt ceiling. And it's disturbing to realize that this power rests in the hands of men who, thanks to the wonk gap, quite literally have no idea what they're doing.

Abstract: The current employment numbers are therefore like a telescope into the future labor market: a 23-year-old who is working part time as a dog walker, yoga instructor or retail clerk may be having fun, but perhaps will receive fewer promotions as a 47-year-old. If we consider four-year college graduates only, average starting salaries, inflation-adjusted, were higher in 2000 than they are today, a decline that started well before the financial crisis.

Full text:   ONE of the most troubling features of the slow economic recovery is that it has largely bypassed young people. This doesn't bode well for the future of the American economy.
For Americans aged 16 to 24 who aren't enrolled in school, the employment picture is grim. Only 36 percent are working full time, down 10 percentage points from 2007. Longer term, the overall labor-force participation rate for that age group has dropped 20 percentage points for men and 14 points for women since 1989.
This lack of jobs will damage the long-term careers of a big chunk of the next working generation. Not working after you finish school very often means missing out on developing the skills and habits that will serve you well later on. The current employment numbers are therefore like a telescope into the future labor market: a 23-year-old who is working part time as a dog walker, yoga instructor or retail clerk may be having fun, but perhaps will receive fewer promotions as a 47-year-old.
One culprit in this situation may be the higher minimum wage enacted in 2009, but the root causes run much deeper.
Employers appear to be more risk-averse, more concerned about overhead costs and less willing to invest in developing young workers' skills. And that seems true across a wide variety of sectors.
In the legal profession, for instance, there is less interest in hiring junior associates and grooming them for partner status. Colleges and universities are often more interested in hiring adjuncts than tenure-track young faculty members. And publishing houses, instead of providing a big advance upfront and investing in young authors over a series of books, now expect many writers to earn their share of a book's revenue through royalties.
If we consider how many jobs are being advertised, without asking whether they are being filled, the labor market seems to be booming. If we measure labor market progress in terms of actual hiring, however, it's clear that the economy is recovering slowly. Employers appear to be looking around for workers but then holding out for the very best candidates, and, if need be, making do with few new hires or none at all.
These are signs of a world where next year's business income is less certain, and many employers take greater care to keep weaker workers off the corporate team. Some employers would rather spend on information technology than hire the wrong workers. Some prefer to invest in the developing world with its longer work hours and lower wages. I outline these processes in my forthcoming book, "Average Is Over: Powering America Beyond the Age of the Great Stagnation" (Dutton Adult).
Young people who are hired often fail to find desirable, high-paying jobs. If we consider four-year college graduates only, average starting salaries, inflation-adjusted, were higher in 2000 than they are today, a decline that started well before the financial crisis. On balance, though, college remains "a good deal," in part because wages for nongraduates have fallen even more than those for graduates. That is hardly a reassuring sign for the broader economy.
THESE developments put economic pressure on higher education. If it's harder to get a good and lucrative job after college, why should students pay ever-rising tuition rates? College doesn't always prepare students very well for the work force, and most graduates don't enjoy the relatively rosy job prospects of computer science and engineering majors.
As tuition increases slow because of a sluggish labor market, colleges will have to change, making their offerings more relevant. But significant improvements may be hard to come by. Slow-growing or even shrinking revenue will strip colleges of financial resources, and they may suddenly have to focus on managing a decline rather than building for a more innovative future.
Policy changes to bolster economic growth and employment, whether by simplifying the tax code, repealing some occupational licensing, bringing more rigor to K-12 schooling or accrediting cheaper online education, may help reverse or curb these trends. But to focus on policy alone is to miss the gravity of the situation.
Falling wages for new entrants to the job market suggest that a sizable chunk of the American labor force may never achieve middle-class wages in a relatively secure full-time job. And many young people don't want to take physically demanding jobs, which are often filled by immigrants. Some young people are breaking out of these traps by starting new Internet or service-based businesses, in lieu of looking for traditional employment. But others end up in part-time, temporary or low-quality jobs, biding their time and hoping that something changes.
We may not like what the market is indicating here, but it would be a mistake to shoot the messenger -- namely, the market itself. Businesses are measuring value more accurately and choosing more cautiously, and though that raises overall productivity, it isn't good for all workers. Many face the burden of meeting the standards of a more demanding world, and not all are succeeding at that task. It's a problem that won't be solved by any kind of quick fix.

Abstract: There are numerous causes of the less-than-satisfying economic growth in America: the retirement of the baby boomers, the withdrawal of working-age men from the labor force, the relentless rise in the inequality of the income distribution and, as I have written about elsewhere, a slowdown in technological innovation. Presidents of Ivy League and other elite schools point to the lavish subsidies they give low- and middle-income students, but this leaves behind the vast majority of American college students who are not lucky or smart enough to attend them.

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDEDFor most of American history, parents could expect that their children would, on average, be much better educated than they were. But that is no longer true. This development has serious consequences for the economy.
The epochal achievements of American economic growth have gone hand in hand with rising educational attainment, as the economists Claudia Goldin and Lawrence F. Katz have shown. From 1891 to 2007, real economic output per person grew at an average rate of 2 percent per year -- enough to double every 35 years. The average American was twice as well off in 2007 as in 1972, four times as well off as in 1937, and eight times as well off as in 1902. It's no coincidence that for eight decades, from 1890 to 1970, educational attainment grew swiftly. But since 1990, that improvement has slowed to a crawl.
Companies pay better-educated people higher wages because they are more productive. The premium that employers pay to a college graduate compared with that to a high school graduate has soared since 1970, because of higher demand for technical and communication skills at the top of the scale and a collapse in demand for unskilled and semiskilled workers at the bottom.
As the current recovery continues at a snail's pace, concerns about America's future growth potential are warranted. Growth in annual average economic output per capita has slowed from the century-long average of 2 percent, to 1.3 percent over the past 25 years, to a mere 0.7 percent over the past decade. As of this summer, per-person output was still lower than it was in late 2007. The gains in income since the 2007-9 Great Recession have flowed overwhelmingly to those at the top, as has been widely noted. Real median family income was lower last year than in 1998.
There are numerous causes of the less-than-satisfying economic growth in America: the retirement of the baby boomers, the withdrawal of working-age men from the labor force, the relentless rise in the inequality of the income distribution and, as I have written about elsewhere, a slowdown in technological innovation.
Education deserves particular focus because its effects are so long-lasting. Every high school dropout becomes a worker who likely won't earn much more than minimum wage, at best, for the rest of his or her life. And the problems in our educational system pervade all levels.
The surge in high school graduation rates -- from less than 10 percent of youth in 1900 to 80 percent by 1970 -- was a central driver of 20th-century economic growth. But the percentage of 18-year-olds receiving bona fide high school diplomas fell to 74 percent in 2000, according to the University of Chicago economist James J. Heckman. He found that the holders of G.E.D.'s performed no better economically than high school dropouts and that the rising share of young people who are in prison rather than in school plays a small but important role in the drop in graduation rates.
Then there is the poor quality of our schools. The Program for International Student Assessment tests have consistently rated American high schoolers as middling at best in reading, math and science skills, compared with their peers in other advanced economies.
At the college level, longstanding problems of quality are joined with the issues of affordability. For most of the postwar period, the G.I. Bill, public and land-grant universities and junior colleges made a low-cost education more accessible in the United States than anywhere in the world. But after leading the world in college completion, America has dropped to 16th. The percentage of 25- to 29-year-olds who hold a four-year bachelor's degree has inched up in the past 15 years, to 33.5 percent, but that is still lower than in many other nations.
The cost of a university education has risen faster than the rate of inflation for decades. Between 2008 and 2012 state financing for higher education declined by 28 percent. Presidents of Ivy League and other elite schools point to the lavish subsidies they give low- and middle-income students, but this leaves behind the vast majority of American college students who are not lucky or smart enough to attend them.
While a four-year college degree still pays off, about one-quarter of recent college graduates are currently unemployed or underemployed. Meanwhile, total student debt now exceeds $1 trillion.
Heavily indebted students face two kinds of risks. One is that they fall short of their income potential, through some combination of unemployment and inability to find a job in their chosen fields. Research has shown that on average a college student taking on $100,000 in student debt will still come out ahead by age 34. But that break-even age goes up if future income falls short of the average.
There is also completion risk. A student who takes out half as much debt but drops out after two years never breaks even because wages of college dropouts are little better than those of high school graduates. These risks are acute for high-achieving students from low-income families: Caroline M. Hoxby, a Stanford economist, found that they often don't apply to elite colleges and wind up at subpar ones, deeply in debt.
Two-year community colleges enroll 42 percent of American undergraduates. The Center on International Education Benchmarking reports that only 13 percent of students in two-year colleges graduate in two years; that figure rises to a still-dismal 28 percent after four years. These students are often working while taking classes and are often poorly prepared for college and required to take remedial courses.
Federal programs like No Child Left Behind and Race to the Top have gone too far in using test scores to evaluate teachers. Many children are culturally disadvantaged, even if one or both parents have jobs, have no books at home, do not read to them, and park them in front of a TV set or a video game in lieu of active in-home learning. Compared with other nations where students learn several languages and have math homework in elementary school, the American system expects too little. Parental expectations also matter: homework should be emphasized more, and sports less.
Poor academic achievement has long been a problem for African-Americans and Hispanics, but now the achievement divide has extended further. Isabel V. Sawhill, an economist at the Brookings Institution, has argued that "family breakdown is now biracial." Among lower-income whites, the proportion of children living with both parents has plummeted over the past half-century, as Charles Murray has noted.
Are there solutions? The appeal of American education as a destination for the world's best and brightest suggests the most obvious policy solution. Shortly before his death, Steve Jobs told President Obama that a green card conferring permanent residency status should be automatically granted to any foreign student with a degree in engineering, a field in which skills are in short supply..
Richard J. Murnane, an educational economist at Harvard, has found evidence that high school and college completion rates have begun to rise again, although part of this may be a result of weak labor markets that induce students to stay in school rather than face unemployment. Other research has shown that high-discipline, "no-excuses" charter schools, like those run by the Knowledge Is Power Program and the Harlem Children's Zone, have erased racial achievement gaps. This model suggests that a complete departure from the traditional public school model, rather than pouring in more money per se, is needed.
Early childhood education is needed to counteract the negative consequences of growing up in disadvantaged households, especially for children who grow up with only one parent. Only one in four American 4-year-olds participate in preschool education programs, but that's already too late. In a remarkable program, Reach Out and Read, 12,000 doctors, nurses and other providers have volunteered to include instruction on the importance of in-home reading to low-income mothers during pediatric checkups.
Even in today's lackluster labor market, employers still complain that they cannot find workers with the needed skills to operate complex modern computer-driven machinery. Lacking in the American system is a well-organized funnel between community colleges and potential blue-collar employers, as in the renowned apprenticeship system in Germany.
How we pay for education shows, in the end, how much we value it. In Canada, each province manages and finances education at the elementary, secondary and college levels, thus avoiding the inequality inherent in America's system of local property-tax financing for public schools. Tuition at the University of Toronto was a mere $5,695 for Canadian arts and science undergraduates last year, compared with $37,576 at Harvard. It should not be surprising that the Canadian college completion rate is about 15 percentage points above the American rate. As daunting as the problems are, we can overcome them. Our economic growth is at stake.

Full text:   DAVID TABOR, 37 and a civil engineer, runs an eight-person home-inspection company in Hurricane, W.Va.
Other than their owners, most small businesses have no employees. His is one of the 4.3 million that do have them, and that employ fewer than 20 people each. And while these companies collectively produce roughly 15 percent of the nation's economic output, their activities aren't captured by the official numbers in a timely or detailed way.
Yet this measurement shortfall in the small-business sector, and a series of other information gaps in the economy, may be overcome by what experts say is an emerging data revolution -- Big Data, in the current catchphrase. The ever-expanding universe of digital signals of behavior, from browsing and buying on the Web to cellphone location data, is grist for potential breakthroughs in economic measurement. It could produce more accurate forecasting and more informed policy-making -- more science and less guesswork.
"We're seeing the emergence of new sets of data and knowledge that we've never had before," says James Poterba, president of the National Bureau of Economic Research and a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "It's a real opportunity for policy makers."
In the small-business case, Mr. Tabor's company, American Home Inspectors and Engineering Assessments Inc., is one of more than 200,000 that have allowed Intuit, the software maker, to gather data on their use of Intuit's online payroll or online accounting products for research on employment and sales trends. The data are stripped of identifying information, and, in asking permission, Intuit also emphasizes that it uses the data to improve its products.
Mr. Tabor said he had no qualms about contributing his anonymized data. "I'm happy they use the data for research and to make their services better," he says.
Intuit began its research in 2004 on small businesses and has expanded its scope, including many more companies and becoming more fine-grained in its data tracking as it has added products, services and customers.
Researchers at the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the government's statistical scorekeeper of economic activity, are now experimenting with the Intuit data, seeking to tap it to improve the official estimates.
"The promise of new data sources, like Intuit and others, is more accurate, more timely and cheaper data for monitoring the economy," says Steve Landefeld, director of the bureau. "That could be a really big step forward."
National income accounting emerged in the Great Depression, in an effort to bridge the economic information gap of its day. In June 1930, based on scattered reports available to him, President Herbert Hoover declared, "The Depression is over," when in reality conditions were quickly worsening.
The main tool for government statistics remains telephone and in-person surveys of households and businesses -- surveys that are costly and time-consuming.
Tracking behavior online can pull in far more data, more quickly -- so that governments should be able to see signs of inflation, deflation and employment trends sooner and adjust policy faster.
For example, the Intuit monthly employment data, based on online monitoring, is current. That is eight months to a year ahead of the government's best statistical look at the health of small business, which is culled from quarterly surveys, state unemployment records and tax returns. The monthly Intuit survey data have also proved accurate, almost mirroring the government results when they are finally reported, according to Susan Woodward, a consulting economist for Intuit.
"Whatever is happening, it is better to know sooner," Ms. Woodward says.
Yet whether more data, collected faster, will improve economic forecasting is uncertain. So far, the results are mixed. An encouraging study, begun in 2009 and repeatedly updated, has used Google searches to predict home sales and prices three months into the future. In the study, the higher the frequency of search terms like "house prices," "real estate agent" and "mortgage rates," the more likely the national housing market would heat up.
The results of the study, "The Future of Prediction," by Lynn Wu, an assistant professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, and Erik Brynjolfsson, a professor at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management, have held up over time. In the most recent version, their model using search data predicted future home sales 24 percent more accurately than the forecasts by experts from the National Association of Realtors.
But another major project using Google search terms points to the limits of such techniques: Google Flu Trends uses the same methods as Big Data-style economic prediction, although it focuses on public health.
The service monitors flu-related search terms and seeks to predict the incidence of flu, ahead of official statistics based on doctors' reports to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2009, with the outbreak of H1N1 flu, Google Flu Trends was prescient.
Yet this past flu season, Google's algorithms stumbled. As an article in the science journal Nature noted in February, Google Flu Trends estimated that nearly 11 percent of Americans were ill at the January peak -- nearly double the 6 percent reported later by the C.D.C. Apparently, the Google algorithms were unable to sift out news reports and social media messages warning of a harsh flu season, which sent flu-related searches spiking.
Google is tweaking its algorithms accordingly. But experts say the episode underlines why the new technology will most likely supplement official economic statistics rather than replace them for the foreseeable future.
"The potential is extraordinarily exciting, but I worry that the expectations are way ahead of the likely reality for the next several years," says Mr. Landefeld of the Bureau of Economic Analysis.
THE economics profession is gearing up to exploit new sources of digital data. In a recent paper, "The Data Revolution and Economic Analysis," two Stanford economists, Liran Einav and Jonathan Levin, concluded that "there is little doubt, at least in our minds, that over the next decades 'big data' will change the landscape of economic policy and economic research."
At Intuit, the small-business data portray a sector that was "hurt much more than big business by the recession and its recovery has been far worse," says Ms. Woodward, the economic consultant. Over the last three and a half years, payroll employment for all companies has increased 6.9 percent, while small-business employment has risen far less, just 1.9 percent. Hiring among the small companies, though still sluggish, has inched ahead in the last three months.
In West Virginia, Mr. Tabor's company did better than many, but his story echoes the national trend. He bought his home-inspection business in 2007, when times were good. But later, when the economy slowed, hours would go by without the phone ringing. "I thought, 'Oh dear, what have I done,' " he recalls.
Mr. Tabor modernized the business, shifting from paper to laptops and smartphones, and expanded into doing valuations for insurance companies and serving as an engineering expert in litigation. Revenue, he said, is up 15 percent this year.
"We are going to be looking to hire, probably next year," he says.

Full text:   Despite a disappointing jobs report on Friday that raised fresh questions about the nation's economic strength, analysts say they still believe the Federal Reserve will start pulling back on its stimulus program in a few weeks.
The Labor Department's snapshot of the job market in August had several discouraging details underneath a relatively mundane headline number, which showed the economy added an estimated 169,000 jobs. Perhaps the most striking was a plunge in the share of Americans who are either working or looking for work, which fell to its lowest level since 1978.
"If you had a more optimistic view of the economy, which I think the Fed does, this should give you some pause," said Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist at MFR. "It's been a real struggle here in the labor market."
At the same time, earlier estimates of job growth in July and June were revised sharply downward, and hiring over the summer months was largely driven by low-wage sectors like retail, food services and health care.
Still, economists said they believed that Fed governors would find enough bright spots in this report to justify scaling back their monthly purchases of long-term Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities -- measures that help push down long-term interest rates -- after their next meeting on Sept. 17 and 18.
"There's just barely enough in that report and in other forward-looking indicators we've seen to give Fed governors the confidence they need on the 18th to taper," said Ian Shepherdson, the chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
"For the record, I don't think they should, given the risks posed by Syria and the impending fiscal chaos in Washington," he said, noting the expected Congressional battles over the debt limit and spending measures. "The costs of delaying until some of those factors are sorted out is not very great. But the Fed has given no indication it's thinking that way."
Investors seemed to agree, with bond yields dipping slightly after the jobs report came out. As for stocks, after a topsy-turvy day, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and the Dow Jones industrial average both closed about where they began on Friday. In Friday trading, the Dow closed down 14.98 points, or 0.1 percent, at 14,992. The S.& P. 500 edged up 0.09 points, or 0.01 percent, closing at 1,655.17. The Nasdaq climbed a slight 1.23 points, or 0.03 percent, to finish at 3,660.01. The price on a 10-year Treasury note rose 16/32, to 96 9/32, with the yield falling to 2.93 from 3.00 on Thursday. The number of payroll jobs added in August was just shy of the average pace of hiring over the last year, and the unemployment rate edged down to 7.3 percent from 7.4 percent. Unemployment, however, fell for the "wrong reasons," Mr. Shapiro said: because people dropped out of the labor force and so were no longer counted as unemployed, and not because more unemployed people found jobs.
The jobless rate is now edging close to the 7 percent level that the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, had identified as the Fed's target for ending its asset purchases altogether around the middle of next year. For several months, Fed governors have been saying that the Fed expected to begin reducing the monthly purchases "later this year," which has been widely interpreted to point toward beginning the shift as early as September.
Charles L. Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and one of the more vocal proponents of highly accommodative monetary policy, used this phrasing in a speech on Friday, suggesting he was open-minded about the "exact pattern of the reduction in purchases that we eventually take."
The Fed's more hawkish members have been more explicit about their desired policy moves. Esther L. George, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City and a leading critic of the asset purchases, said on Friday that the Fed should cut its bond buying to $70 billion a month in September, from the current $85 billion a month, split between Treasuries and mortgage bonds. "It is time to begin a gradual -- and predictable -- normalization of policy," she said.
Some economists suggested that Fed governors could react to the latest economic data by tapering their bond purchases slowly over a longer period of time and perhaps in conjunction with other measures that would underscore the central bank's commitment to helping the economy heal. For example, the Fed could announce that it is extending the period that it holds short-term interest rates near zero.
"This is their chance to lay out a road map for policy to help institutionalize the support the Fed is providing, regardless of who is sitting around the table come January," said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial in Chicago, referring to Mr. Bernanke's still-unknown successor to lead the Fed over the next four years. "The Fed operates based on institutional momentum. It only flips on a dime in a crisis."
Despite the generally dismal picture, there were some bright spots in Friday's jobs report, including a tick upward in the average number of hours worked and a 5-cent gain in hourly wages for private sector workers. Over the last year, average hourly earnings have risen by 52 cents, or 2.2 percent, before adjusting for inflation. (Year-over-year inflation has averaged about 1.6 percent so far in 2013.) "It's not just about how many jobs, but how much people earn in those jobs," said Douglas P. Handler, chief United States economist for IHS Global Insight.
Concerns remain about the quality of jobs being created. The industries driving hiring, like retail and food services, are more likely to hire part-time workers and operate on just-in-time schedules, making it difficult for employees to predict how many hours they will have from week to week.
"It's really frustrating not knowing whether I'll have money to pay rent and my bills," said Charles Eden, 20, who works at a Wendy's in St. Louis for $7.60 an hour. Last week, he had 30 hours; this week, 12. Ideally, he wants 40. "It's really hard to find a second job not knowing whether I can work or whether I can't work in a given week."
As of August, there were 7.9 million Americans who wanted to work full time but could find only part-time work. When these workers and people who want a job but have stopped looking are included, the total underemployment rate rises to 13.7 percent.
The labor force participation rate remains so low partly because the population is aging and partly because workers are sitting on the sidelines as they wait for the economy to heal. The big decline in the labor force in August was tied entirely to men dropping out; the number of women in the work force actually grew.
"This suggests that much of the decline came from occupations that are male-dominated, such as construction, and that many former workers are becoming discouraged about their job prospects and dropping out of the labor force as a result," said Mr. Handler.
Three-quarters of the jobs added in August went to women, said Joan Entmacher, vice president for family economic security at the National Women's Law Center. Most of the new jobs for women in August were in low-wage sectors, though, and men have captured most of the job gains since the recovery officially began in June 2009.
Some workers who took shelter from the poor job market by enrolling in college and retraining programs these last few years -- which young women have been much more likely to do than young men -- are finally starting to cycle back into the work force, and the lucky ones are finding new and higher-paying opportunities.
"I have people call me all the time now wanting to give me a job, and I have to say, O.K., thank you, but I think I have enough jobs now," said Jordan Douglas of Pampa, Tex., a single mother working 60 to 70 hours a week in three jobs as a registered nurse.
Ms. Douglas, 25, was laid off from a nursing home in February 2012 and struggled to find work. She decided to enroll in school full-time after finding a program that allowed her to continue receiving unemployment benefits while in training. Given her longer hours and higher hourly wage today, she now earns more than twice as much as she did before she was laid off.
"I couldn't have been where I am today had I not gone back to school, and I couldn't have gone back to school if I hadn't gotten laid off," she said. "I didn't know it at the time, but it worked out perfectly."

Abstract: Set aside the politics for a moment, and ask what the past five years would have looked like if the U.S. government had actually been able and willing to do what textbook macroeconomics says it should have done -- namely, make a big enough push for job creation to offset the effects of the financial crunch and the housing bust, postponing fiscal austerity and tax increases until the private sector was ready to take up the slack.

Full text:   In a few days, we'll reach the fifth anniversary of the fall of Lehman Brothers -- the moment when a recession, which was bad enough, turned into something much scarier. Suddenly, we were looking at the real possibility of economic catastrophe.
And the catastrophe came.
Wait, you say, what catastrophe? Weren't people warning about a second Great Depression? And that didn't happen, did it? Yes, they were, and no, it didn't -- although the Greeks, the Spaniards, and others might not agree about that second point. The important thing, however, is to realize that there are degrees of disaster, that you can have an immense failure of economic policy that falls short of producing total collapse. And the failure of policy these past five years has, in fact, been immense.
Some of that immensity can be measured in dollars and cents. Reasonable measures of the "output gap" over the past five years -- the difference between the value of goods and services America could and should have produced and what it actually produced -- run well over $2 trillion. That's trillions of dollars of pure waste, which we will never get back.
Behind that financial waste lies an even more tragic waste of human potential. Before the financial crisis, 63 percent of adult Americans were employed; that number quickly plunged to less than 59 percent, and there it remains.
How did that happen? It wasn't a mass outbreak of laziness, and right-wing claims that jobless Americans aren't trying hard enough to find work because they're living high on food stamps and unemployment benefits should be treated with the contempt they deserve. A bit of the decline in employment can be attributed to an aging population, but the rest reflects, as I said, an immense failure of economic policy.
Set aside the politics for a moment, and ask what the past five years would have looked like if the U.S. government had actually been able and willing to do what textbook macroeconomics says it should have done -- namely, make a big enough push for job creation to offset the effects of the financial crunch and the housing bust, postponing fiscal austerity and tax increases until the private sector was ready to take up the slack. I've done a back-of-the-envelope calculation of what such a program would have entailed: It would have been about three times as big as the stimulus we actually got, and would have been much more focused on spending rather than tax cuts.
Would such a policy have worked? All the evidence of the past five years says yes. The Obama stimulus, inadequate as it was, stopped the economy's plunge in 2009. Europe's experiment in anti-stimulus -- the harsh spending cuts imposed on debtor nations -- didn't produce the promised surge in private-sector confidence. Instead, it produced severe economic contraction, just as textbook economics predicted. Government spending on job creation would, indeed, have created jobs.
But wouldn't the kind of spending program I'm suggesting have meant more debt? Yes -- according to my rough calculation, at this point federal debt held by the public would have been about $1 trillion more than it actually is. But alarmist warnings about the dangers of modestly higher debt have proved false. Meanwhile, the economy would also have been stronger, so that the ratio of debt to G.D.P. -- the usual measure of a country's fiscal position -- would have been only a few points higher. Does anyone seriously think that this difference would have provoked a fiscal crisis?
And, on the other side of the ledger, we would be a richer nation, with a brighter future -- not a nation where millions of discouraged Americans have probably dropped permanently out of the labor force, where millions of young Americans have probably seen their lifetime career prospects permanently damaged, where cuts in public investment have inflicted long-term damage on our infrastructure and our educational system.
Look, I know that as a political matter an adequate job-creation program was never a real possibility. And it's not just the politicians who fell short: Many economists, instead of pointing the way toward a solution of the jobs crisis, became part of the problem, fueling exaggerated fears of inflation and debt.
Still, I think it's important to realize how badly policy failed and continues to fail. Right now, Washington seems divided between Republicans who denounce any kind of government action -- who insist that all the policies and programs that mitigated the crisis actually made it worse -- and Obama loyalists who insist that they did a great job because the world didn't totally melt down.
Obviously, the Obama people are less wrong than the Republicans. But, by any objective standard, U.S. economic policy since Lehman has been an astonishing, horrifying failure.

Full text:   MUMBAI -- India had seemed tantalizingly close to embarking on the same dash for economic growth that has lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty in China and across East Asia.
Its economy now stands in disarray, with the prospect of worse to come in the next few months.
Vinod Vanigota, a Mumbai wholesaler of imported computer hard drives, said sales dropped by a quarter in the last two weeks. The rupee, India's currency, has been so volatile in recent days that he began revising his price lists every half-hour.
Business activity at Chip Com Traders, where he is the managing director and co-owner, has slowed so sharply that trucking companies plead for business. "One of the companies called today and said, 'Don't you have a parcel of any sort for us to deliver today?' " Mr. Vanigota said.
The economic decline has laid bare chronic problems, little remarked upon during the recent boom. An antiquated infrastructure, a sclerotic job market, exorbitant real estate costs and bloated state-owned enterprises never allowed manufacturing, especially manufacturing for export, to grow strong.
The rupee fell further and faster in August against the dollar than any of the world's 77 other internationally traded currencies as investors in affluent countries took their money home for higher returns. It was down 20 percent since May, a period in which the stock market followed suit and fell almost 8 percent.
The real estate market is teetering after soaring to vertiginous heights over the last few years. Cranes on Mumbai's skyline perch nearly immobilized as developers struggle for cash.
The things the emerging middle class coveted, Chevrolets, iPhones and foreign vacations, have all jumped sharply in price in recent weeks.
The price increases threaten to worsen consumer price inflation -- already among the highest in Asia at an annual rate of almost 10 percent -- and widen the country's already large international trade deficit and government budget deficit.
India's government is now bracing the country for a swift increase in the price of diesel fuel and other imported necessities priced in dollars. Diesel is the lifeblood of the Indian economy, from the trucks that crawl along the country's jammed, potholed roads to the backyard generators that struggle to compensate for the high-cost yet unreliable electricity grid.
Some economists say that they hope India will have only a V-shaped economic downturn, with a rebound starting by early next year if a weak rupee rejuvenates India's struggling exporters.
"India is not Greece -- we never binged on debt on a grand scale," said Ajay Shah, a prominent economist at the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy in New Delhi.
The root of the problem is India's failure to create a vibrant industrial base with the strength to export. As Western buyers scour Asia for alternatives to increasingly expensive Chinese factories, India and its enfeebled manufacturing sector are mostly ignored.
Soeb Z. Bandukwala, a managing director of Ansons Electro Mechanical Works, a maker of water pumps and electric motors, wonders how a recovery can arrive, given India's structural problems. He runs a business that has been in his family since 1967 and has grown to four factories.
Yet he keeps each factory at fewer than 50 workers and has maintained some metal grinding machines and other equipment in use since the 1970s without replacement. His worry is that if he exceeds 50 workers or surpasses certain benchmarks for total investment, he will become subject to extensive labor legislation.
"There is a fear, and the fear is the labor laws," said Mr. Bandukwala, who is also a regional leader in the Confederation of Indian Industry.
Infrastructure is also a problem. Ansons is only 35 miles from the port through which it exports machinery to Europe. Yet trucks require four to seven hours to reach the port because promised expressways have never been built.
Speeds barely faster than walking at least help protect pumps and motors from harm. "If the speed is greater, damage will take place because of the potholes," Mr. Bandukwala said.
Poor infrastructure has also driven up costs for industrial real estate in India, which are high compared with China's. Just in the last five years, China has opened 5,800 miles of high-speed rail routes and 400,000 miles of highways of two or more lanes. That has allowed tens of thousands of factories to move to smaller towns in the interior with much lower land costs.
India has been unable to open up its interior the same way, building half as many miles of highways over the same period and no high-speed rail routes. At the same time, rent control and other land regulations make it extremely difficult to tear down and replace even the most dilapidated buildings.
So cities like Mumbai have ended up with dozens of square miles of mold-stained, low-rise buildings with spots of bright green fungus, interspersed by the occasional skyscrapers that were somehow built. Remote, outer fringes of factories and office buildings have sprouted on what was once farmland.
The acute shortage of real estate less than a day's drive from ports has produced steep real estate prices and rents. Challenge Overseas, a trousers manufacturer, paid $1.3 million five years ago to buy the 20,000-square-foot top floor of a decrepit, four-story factory building with blocked fire escapes on a muddy alley on the outskirts of Mumbai, and sold it for $2.7 million last month. The floor underneath, the company's 60-employee factory, sold for $410,000 in 2003 and is now valued at $1.2 million.
Roads and bridges to inland towns are not the only infrastructure problem. Shakti Industries, which thins and cuts aluminum wires for jewelry manufacturers, pays the equivalent of 15 to 18 cents per kilowatt-hour for electricity. In China, even after a round of price increases coming in late September to pay for more clean energy, factory owners will pay half as much.
Shakti has only seven employees. Yet it is regulated by more than a dozen government agencies, each of which sends a separate inspector each year before issuing licenses for things as diverse as electricity use and water pollution. Many of the inspectors demand bribes, said Vipul S. Kamani, the managing director of Shakti.
High real estate and electricity costs leave businesses with very little money to pay workers and remain competitive in the global markets for garments and other manufactured goods.
Arun Prajapati, 21, a migrant worker at a fabric fusing machine at Challenge, said that he earned about $100 a month, just a fifth of what Chinese workers earn these days.
He pays $9 a month for rent and electricity for his sleeping space on the floor of a 10-foot-by-10-foot room that he shares with five other migrant workers in a nearby shanty. He spends $38 a month for a subsistence diet of roti bread, lentils and, once a week, some chicken or eggs. He sends his meager savings to his widowed mother in their home village in central India.
"With expenses rising each month, things are only getting harder and harder," he said. "I am just trying to get through life."
One private sector industrial giant that bet heavily on an economic takeoff in India is the Essar Group, based in Mumbai. In the last five years it has invested nearly $18 billion to build one of the world's largest refineries and one of the world's biggest steel mills in northwestern India while tripling capacity at its ports and quadrupling the output of its power plants.
But the company now plans to collect income from these projects instead of building more, and it is even selling three steel-related businesses to pay down debt.
Haseeb A. Drabu, a former government economic planner and bank chairman who is now Essar's chief economic adviser, said that at Essar and across India, "I don't see any fresh wave of investment."

Full text:   MUMBAI, India -- Indian newspapers have been gushing about the new governor of the central bank, Raghuram Rajan, in terms usually reserved for Bollywood film stars: his trim physique, his long-distance running, even his "rather photogenic appeal," as The Mumbai Mirror tabloid wrote this week.
This may not last long.
Mr. Rajan, 50, took charge on Wednesday of the Reserve Bank of India, which has tried and failed to stop the steep decline of the rupee against the dollar. India's chronic inflation is almost certain to move higher in the coming months, given the country's heavy dependence on imported oil priced in dollars. The stock market is plunging as economic activity slows by the day.
Yet unlike Ben S. Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, Mr. Rajan has very little political independence in his new job. Some of the biggest problems bedeviling the Indian economy are beyond his control, like the trade and government budget deficits and the crippling shortage of roads and other infrastructure.
All of his policy options carry big risks that could antagonize large sectors of the public, who will soon forget the rapturous accounts of his athleticism and charm.
"Any entrant to the central bank governorship probably starts at the height of their popularity," Mr. Rajan said at a news conference early Wednesday evening. "Some of the actions I take will not be popular. The governorship of the central bank is not meant to win one votes or Facebook 'likes.' "
Mr. Rajan, a University of Chicago finance professor, used his initial news conference to announce a long list of financial deregulatory measures that he plans in the coming weeks and months. These included issuing more licenses for new banks, making it easier for banks to open branches across the country and gradually lowering the percentage of assets that banks must hold in government securities -- three steps aimed at increasing competition in India's banking sector, long viewed by critics as a clubby, cautious industry reluctant to lend to small and medium-size businesses or farmers.
The most immediate question facing Mr. Rajan, a former chief economist for the International Monetary Fund whose most recent job has been as chief economic adviser to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, lies in how to halt the fall of the rupee. He said nothing on Wednesday evening about monetary policy, deferring the subject to a statement to be issued on Sept. 20.
Currency market intervention by the Reserve Bank has helped limit the rupee's losses this week, and it even gained 0.94 percent on Wednesday, to 67.09 to the dollar. But the rupee's slide through the summer and its continued weakness have fostered speculation in financial markets that Mr. Rajan might raise short-term interest rates in his first week in office.
A sliding currency pushes up inflation. An inflation-fighting central banker could raise interest rates. Higher rates would make investment in India more attractive to foreign and domestic money managers who have been hustling to move money out of the country. It could help curb inflation, already approaching 10 percent even before the full effect of rising import prices is felt in the coming weeks.
But with the economy already growing at its slowest pace since the worst of the global financial crisis in early 2009, India's business establishment fiercely opposes any increases in interest rates. The Confederation of Indian Industry, the country's most prominent business coalition, reiterated on Tuesday its call for the Reserve Bank of India to cut short-term interest rates a full percentage point.
"The last thing you want is to choke off any hope of growth by raising" the benchmark interest rate, said Omkar Goswami, the chairman of CERG Advisory, a consulting firm based in Delhi, and an independent director of Indian companies like Infosys, a big outsourcing company, and IDFC, a financial conglomerate.
Mr. Rajan has a few longer-term options. The Indian government could issue dollar-denominated bonds or seek a loan from his former colleagues at the I.M.F. Either step would replenish and expand the Reserve Bank's supply of foreign exchange for further currency market intervention if the rupee started tumbling again.
But it is not going to be solely his call. In contrast with the political independence of the Federal Reserve or the European Central Bank, the Reserve Bank of India, headquartered here since before the country's independence from Britain in 1947, is required by law to consult closely and take direction from the government in New Delhi.
Sometimes the government is unusually open, at least by Western standards, in pushing around the Reserve Bank. In late April, a top adviser to Mr. Singh, the prime minister, said publicly that there was a "case for R.B.I. to cut interest rate" policy, and added," I think we have a case for stronger growth."
The adviser who made the remarks was Mr. Rajan. The Reserve Bank of India took action that resulted in the rupee slowly sliding. It has fallen every month since then.
Less than three weeks after the Reserve Bank acted, on May 22, Mr. Bernanke told Congress that the Fed could start reducing its asset purchases in the coming months. The suggestion that the Fed might buy fewer bonds resulted in a drop in bond prices, pushing up yields, and prompting international investors to begin shifting money out of emerging markets like India and into the United States.
India's leaders appear to have been taken by surprise. Mr. Rajan and other leading policy makers had been framing the national discussion over interest rate policy in terms of whether the Reserve Bank should keep rates fairly high to fight inflation or start cutting them to rekindle economic growth.
"The R.B.I. did not have a view on what the Fed would do," said Madan Sabnavis, the chief economist of Care Ratings, a big Indian credit ratings agency headquartered in New Delhi.
As investors began pulling large sums of money out of India, the Reserve Bank effectively reversed course in mid-July and began tightening monetary policy. But it did so in a face-saving way that attracted little attention outside India -- raising the borrowing cost for commercial banks that are especially heavy borrowers from the central bank.
Faced with double-digit borrowing costs, banks began cutting back on lending, which has hurt many businesses in India and contributed to a further slowing of the economy.
Mr. Rajan's supporters said he should not be blamed for putting pressure on the Reserve Bank in late April to reduce interest rates. They said he was only voicing a widely held view in the government at the time that inflation was beginning to recede.
Mr. Rajan said on Wednesday evening that he would not discuss past monetary policy decisions.
Like many central bankers, Mr. Rajan leans toward putting a greater emphasis on reducing inflation and is reluctant to risk higher inflation for the sake of short-term increases in economic growth, people who know him said. Mr. Rajan seemed to confirm that at his news conference early Wednesday evening, when he emphasized that the role of the bank was monetary stability. "Ultimately, this means low and stable expectations of inflation, whether that inflation stems from domestic sources or from changes in the value of the currency, from supply constraints or demand pressures," he said.
Mr. Rajan also has a history of skepticism about financial innovations, having warned in a paper in 2005 that they had made credit markets more risky and could prompt a financial crisis.
That was not a popular view at the time. Lawrence H. Summers, the former Treasury secretary, now said to be the chief candidate to lead the Fed, publicly described Mr. Rajan's paper then as "slightly Luddite" and "largely misguided."

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The collision of the $1 trillion in budget cuts known as sequestration and the breakdown of the normal budgeting process is creating headaches not just for Washington but also for a vast web of offices dependent on federal financing. Many have been left uncertain as to how much money -- if any -- they will have to spend in the year ahead.
"I don't want to throw darts or rocks at anybody," said Gov. Neil Abercrombie, Democrat of Hawaii, at the National Governors Association convention last month in Milwaukee, venting his frustration over the budget uncertainty. "I just want to know what the hell the numbers are."
The budget woes are afflicting, among others, state governments, American Indian tribes, military contractors and cancer research laboratories. Budget experts said that the short-term concerns over next year's dollar figures were already hampering long-term planning and making government officials hesitant to commit to big projects or to hire needed employees.
"You're eating away little by little at the infrastructure and effectiveness of government," said Philip Joyce, a professor at the University of Maryland.
In an interview, Dr. Francis Collins, the director of the National Institutes of Health, called 2013 the "darkest ever" year for the agency, whose budget is at its lowest inflation-adjusted appropriations level in more than a decade. The agency has been awarding grants to an increasingly smaller sliver of applicants as well.
The stopgap measures that have kept the government running have further hobbled the agency, he added. "Continuing resolutions discourage you from trying something new and bold," he said. "You're supposed to tread water. And science is very badly served by that tread-water message."
One researcher who said he had felt the impact of the budget wars is Steven Salzberg, the director of the Center for Computational Biology at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore and a lauded biomedical researcher. Mr. Salzberg said that he had received about 20 percent less in federal funding than his peers had recommended for his work on the biological underpinnings of cancer and other diseases.
"Less science is getting done," he said. "That means cures won't emerge. Five years from now, when your aunt gets cancer and you can't do anything for her, people won't stop and think, 'Jesus, if we only hadn't had the sequester!' "
Shorter grant cycles have forced scientists to rush to get results, he said. Increasing competition for funding has left him and his peers spending more and more time on paperwork, and less and less time on laboratory work. Worst of all, he said, promising young scientists are becoming discouraged and leaving the field.
"The current budget wars are a more extreme or egregious version of what has been going on for a number of years," Mr. Salzberg said. "They're wreaking havoc on people's research plans."
A broad range of budget officials described similar headaches emanating from Washington. Sequestration has forced programs that normally expect flat or increasing financing to make sudden cuts. Many programs delayed those cuts, and are scrambling to make them now -- in some cases with reduced staffs because of furloughs or hiring freezes.
A number of budget issues lingered unresolved during Congress's long summer recess. Earlier this year, the House and the Senate passed spending bills for the 2014 fiscal year, which begins on Oct. 1, that were about $90 billion apart, but never settled on a final figure.
With lawmakers returning to Washington next week, Congress is expected to pass another stopgap bill, known as a continuing resolution, financing the government for a few more months, but it is unclear whether such funding will stay at current levels or shrink. And if the Republicans who control the House and the Democrats who hold sway in the Senate fail to come to a deal before October, many parts of the federal government could shut down.
The breakdown of the Congressional budgeting process this summer has compounded the problems. Officials said that they had received no word about budget figures from Congressional appropriators -- because such numbers do not yet exist.
For public housing offices, the disarray means, at a minimum, a delay in maintenance, capital projects and hiring. It also could lead to a cutback in the number of vouchers issued to low-income families to help pay for their homes.
"It's a recipe for frustration," said Sunia Zaterman of the Council of Large Public Housing Authorities. "The greater uncertainty is leaving programs wondering how many vouchers to issue," she said. "And at the same time, they're laying off staff because their administrative funding level is down."
Military spending is particularly vulnerable. Were Congress to pass a measure keeping government spending at its current level, the Defense Department would still have to make about $20 billion in new cuts because of a quirk in the sequestration law. Already, the department is making about $1 trillion in long-term reductions and contemplating laying off thousands of civilian employees to hit its numbers.
Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel has repeatedly said that the uncertainty has hampered the military's long-term planning. He told Congress in June that uncertainty "from month to month, year to year, as to what our possibilities are for contracts for acquisitions, for technology, for research -- the technological advantage that we have in the air and the superiority we have at sea, the training, the readiness -- all of these are affected."
Both Democrats and Republicans have voiced concerns about the detrimental impact of sequestration and the faltering budget process.
"I'm hearing from so many people across Washington State that sequestration and budget uncertainty is making it hard, and in some cases impossible, to keep up with demand for crucial services," said Senator Patty Murray, the chairwoman of the Senate Budget Committee. "It's terrible policy, and it's simply unacceptable."
Behind the logjam lies a deep ideological rift about how big the government should be, which persists even as the federal deficit continues to shrink rapidly.
Some House Republicans have indicated they want to push for further spending cuts beyond sequestration, and they are gearing up for fights on President Obama's health law and the debt ceiling this month as well. Senate Democrats and the White House want to repeal sequestration and replace it with a package that would make longer-term changes in entitlement programs like Medicare and include some tax increases that would help avoid the most painful spending cuts.
In the meantime, those who actually run the day-to-day operation of the federal government keep guessing and waiting.

Full text:   FRANKFURT -- Whenever Germany thrived, so did the rest of Europe. But that long-held belief is being questioned by its neighbors, which see evidence that the country is taking off without them.
Despite Berlin's hefty financial support of the euro zone's more beleaguered members in the last few years, the economic crisis has corroded commercial ties between Germany and the rest of Europe. Countries like Italy and Spain no longer have the purchasing power they once did, and they trade less with Germany because of it.
Greece, the most distressed country in Europe, is now little more than a German rounding error. German exports to Greece plunged 40 percent from 2008, while Germany imported 9 percent less from Greece. Last year, Greece ranked 44th among German trading partners, just behind Vietnam.
No wonder German companies, cheered on by the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel, have turned their attention to faster-growing places like Asia or the United States.
"Right now it's a decoupling story rather than a helping-hand story," said Carsten Brzeski, a senior economist at the Dutch bank ING.
It is not simply an economic issue, but a geopolitical one.
Ms. Merkel is running for re-election this month in a campaign in which one of the few debating points is how many more financial handouts Germany will give to its weaker neighbors. She has made a conscious effort of building closer ties with bigger and faster-growing markets like China. If the Merkel government succeeds in making Germany a bigger global player through trade and investment policy, it not only insulates Germany from European structural woes but also ensures that it remains a global economic force in its own right.
For the rest of the euro zone and the larger European Union, however, unity depends on the sustained energy and commitment of Germany, the wealthiest and most powerful member. The more that Germany sees its long-term interests lying outside Europe, the less certain the future of the entire European project.
"Germany is less willing to play ball," said Stefano Micossi, director general of Assonime, an Italian business group and research organization. Rather than pulling together, he said, European leaders have been "falling back to mutual mistrust and national solutions."
On Tuesday, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said that even as Germany resumed growth, the euro zone's most vulnerable countries were unlikely to follow until sometime next year. European banks remain weak, the group said, while lending -- usually considered a prerequisite for economic growth -- continues to decline.
The euro zone's economic future remains heavily dependent on Germany, the biggest market for products like shoes from Italy or Ford minivans made in Spain. German companies like Linde, a large supplier of gases for use in industry and health care, are major employers in Southern Europe.
But Linde's big growth this year was in the United States, where sales rose 58 percent in the third quarter, to $2.6 billion, thanks to the purchase of Lincare, a company that supplies oxygen to patients in their homes.
The United States has also become a hot market for German companies like Voith, a maker of industrial equipment, which said last month that it expected to profit from a new law intended to encourage construction of hydroelectric power plants. Voith issued a statement calling the new law "terrific news" -- no surprise considering that the company is one of the world's largest suppliers of hydropower equipment.
In addition, China has become the most important market for Volkswagen, which sold 1.5 million cars there in the first six months of this year, more than in Western Europe. Volkswagen is also putting renewed emphasis on North America. In 2011, it opened a factory in Chattanooga, Tenn., that contributed to a 10 percent increase in American sales through June from a year earlier.
"It's kind of natural that Germany has to look for new trading partners," said Wolfgang Lechthaler, a senior researcher at the Kiel Institute for the World Economy in Kiel, Germany. Even if trade with the rest of Europe recovers, "many business relations are also long-term relations," he said. "It might not go back to the same level as before."
German annualized growth of 2.9 percent in the second quarter of this year lifted the average for the euro zone as a whole and, at least on paper, ended a regional recession that began in 2011.
But a closer look at the numbers shows a big gulf between growing, northern-tier countries like Germany, Austria or Finland and southern countries like Spain, Italy and Greece, which continue to contract, albeit at a more moderate pace than before. The divide makes for tricky navigation by the European Central Bank, which will hold its monthly monetary policy meeting on Thursday, as it tries to promote growth in the ailing countries while heading off inflation in the healthier ones.
"Average data for the euro area disguises some divergence," Jörg Asmussen, a member of the executive board of the European Central Bank, acknowledged in an interview in Berlin last week. "You have some countries with robust growth. On the other hand, you have countries that are deep in recession."
The question now is whether German companies might rediscover some of their traditional markets in Europe, given the tentative signs of stabilization. Economic output in Spain, Italy and Greece shrank but at a much slower pace than in previous quarters. Unemployment fell slightly in Spain and Italy, though it continued to rise in Greece.
If the southern-tier European countries recover, they could once again become attractive places to do business or produce goods.
Despite the strains on European unity, the shared currency as well as a relatively homogeneous legal system could eventually work in favor of the most stricken countries. And even with the growth of trade with China and the United States, Germany's largest trading partner is still France, with which it did 169 billion euros ($223 billion) in import-export business last year.
"Europe plays a completely different role than China," said Karl-Heinz Paqué, a professor of economics at the University of Magdeburg in Germany. "It's not only trade links, it's also deep integration."
It will take more than help from Germany to reduce unemployment in Spain and Greece to tolerable levels. The General Confederation of Workers of Greece, a research institute tied to Greece's largest labor union, concluded in a study leaked this week that Greek unemployment could require two decades to fall to 10 percent from nearly 28 percent today.
Mr. Asmussen of the European Central Bank said it would take years to fix the imbalances that led to the euro zone crisis, which include excess debt and loss of competitiveness by the stricken countries. "The probability of catastrophic events has been drastically decreased," he said, but Europe still faces "an adjustment decade."

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The spreading expectation that President Obama will name Lawrence H. Summers to lead the Federal Reserve Board appears to be working against the central bank's efforts to stimulate the economy.
The jitters even have some analysts betting that a Summers nomination could lead to slower economic growth, less job creation and higher interest rates than if the president named Janet L. Yellen, the Fed's vice chairwoman.
Businesses raising money and people buying homes and cars all have faced higher interest rates in recent months as the Fed's campaign to suppress borrowing costs has faltered. The rise in rates reflects optimism that the economy is gaining strength, and an expectation that the Fed will begin to pull back later this year. But a wide range of financial analysts also see evidence of a Summers effect.
Many investors expected that Ms. Yellen would be nominated to replace Ben S. Bernanke as head of the central bank, a choice that would have sent a clear message of continuity. Instead, investors are now trying to anticipate how Mr. Summers might change the Fed.
The unease is the product of a little information and a lot of speculation. Mr. Summers, a Harvard University economist who served for two years as Mr. Obama's primary economic adviser, has said little about monetary policy in recent years. Investors are left parsing a handful of comments in which he has expressed some doubts on the benefits and concern about the consequences of the Fed's policies.
"People don't know what Larry might do," said Mohamed El-Erian, chief executive of Pimco, the giant bond fund manager. "There's a lack of a lot of information on Larry's views. We don't have enough information to make an assessment, just some second- and thirdhand accounts."
Some doubts always attend the arrival of a new Fed chairman, but the consequences are particularly freighted at the moment because the Fed's effectiveness increasingly depends on its ability to reduce uncertainty among investors. The central bank floored its traditional gas pedal five years ago when it pushed short-term interest rates to zero. It has since focused on further reducing long-term interest rates -- which determine the cost of most kinds of borrowing -- largely by convincing investors that short-term rates will remain near zero.
The sense of uncertainty is heightened by the fact that as many as five of the Fed's seven governors may be replaced in the next year.
One governor, Elizabeth A. Duke, stepped down at the end of August. A second governor, Sarah Bloom Raskin, has been nominated to serve as deputy Treasury secretary. Mr. Bernanke's term ends in January, as does the term of a fourth governor, Jerome H. Powell -- although Mr. Obama could choose to reappoint Mr. Powell, a Republican who joined the Fed only in May last year and is said to be open to a longer stay. If Ms. Yellen is passed over by Mr. Obama, she, too, could choose to leave even before her term as vice chairwoman ends in October 2014.
Mr. Obama said last month that he would not announce his choice for the Fed's top spot until the fall, and that he was considering at least three candidates: Mr. Summers, Ms. Yellen and the former Fed vice chairman Donald L. Kohn. But the president's top economic advisers uniformly support the selection of Mr. Summers. They regard him as a creative thinker and an experienced crisis manager, qualities they value in particular because they expect the Fed may confront difficult choices as it begins to retreat from its six-year-old stimulus campaign.
They also insist that Mr. Summers supports the Fed's efforts to revive the economy and would continue those efforts.
But Mr. Summers has criticized the Fed's purchases of Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities, warning that bond-buying on such a scale could distort financial markets. He said it was "less efficacious for the real economy than most people suppose." As a result, many investors suspect he would seek to end those purchases more quickly than Ms. Yellen.
Julia Coronado, chief North America economist at BNP Paribas, said last week that the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note already had started to rise as investors price in a Summers nomination. She added that the yield could eventually rise half a percentage point more than if the president nominated Ms. Yellen instead. Ms. Coronado estimated that this Summers effect would reduce domestic economic growth by 0.5 to 0.75 percentage point over the next two years, which could reduce job creation by 350,000 to 500,000 jobs.
A Summers nomination, she wrote, "would come at a cost of higher market volatility and interest rates, and a less buoyant economic recovery."
Leadership changes at the Fed tend to unsettle financial markets more than changes in leadership at other major central banks, according to a 2007 study by Kenneth N. Kuttner, an economist at Williams College, and Adam S. Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics. That is partly because the Fed is the closest thing to a global central bank. But it also reflects the outsize role of the Fed chairman, who is less constrained than other central bankers in making policy.
Mr. Bernanke has sought to reduce the chairman's role, most notably by adopting a 2 percent inflation objective. The Fed also has sought to lock in the course of near-term policy by announcing its intent to hold short-term rates near zero at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6.5 percent. But Mr. Posen said that the market turbulence of recent months showed that investors still thought the choice of chairman would determine the course of policy. "This is one of the reasons I don't believe that forward guidance works," he wrote in an e-mail, referring to the Fed's declaration of intentions regarding short-term rates. "There is no way it can be binding on a new chairperson."
Historically, new Fed chairmen have been able to settle the doubts of investors by acting quickly after taking office.
In the week after President George W. Bush announced Mr. Bernanke's nomination in October 2005, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 4.57 percent from 4.39 percent as buyers demanded increased compensation against the risk of higher inflation. Bond yields also rose after Alan Greenspan was nominated as Fed chairman in 1987. Both men moved almost immediately to raise interest rates and bond yields receded.
But Mr. Summers would have no comparable opportunity. The most obvious way to show his commitment to the Fed's stimulus campaign, at least in the short term, would be to do nothing. "The only thing he can do," said Ms. Coronado, "is to show more patience."

Full text:   LOS ANGELES -- Here in Hollywood, the land of false-front movie sets and business-has-never-been-better studio spin doctors, summer ticket sales are being summed up with a single word: blockbuster.
Ticket revenue in North America for the period between the first weekend in May and Labor Day totaled $4.71 billion, a 10.2 percent increase over the same period last year, according to analyst projections. Attendance rose 6.6 percent, to about 573 million. Higher ticket prices contributed to the rest of the growth.
But behind that rosy picture lurk some darker realities.
Ticket sales rose in part because Hollywood crammed an unusually large number of big-budget movies into the summer, a period that typically accounts for 40 percent of box office revenue. Studios released 23 films that cost $75 million and up (sometimes way up), 53 percent more than in the same period last year.
The audience fragmented as a result, leaving films like "The Wolverine" and "The Hangover Part III" wobbling when they should have been slam dunks.
"Turbo" the animated snail was squished, taking in $80 million at North American theaters -- one of the smallest totals in DreamWorks Animation history. (Only the unfortunately titled "Flushed Away" from 2006 did worse.)
"We're very pleased with the overall strength of the summer," said John Fithian, president of the National Association of Theater Owners, "but there was almost too much product. Some of these individual movies would have made more money if studios had spread them out a little more."
Mr. Fithian noted that the $4.71 billion in total summer ticket sales represents a new high-water mark for the industry, not accounting for inflation, and the growth comes after several years of largely flat sales or declines.
It is not surprising that more films sold more overall tickets, but the total does demonstrate a resilience for cinema as competition for consumer attention continues to spike.
"To keep the exhibition business alive, we have to give people a darn good reason to put down all their electronics and get in their cars and get into theaters, and this summer we did it," said Nikki Rocco, president of distribution at Universal Pictures, which printed money with "Despicable Me 2" and "Fast & Furious 6," both of which took in roughly $800 million worldwide.
Still, appearances can be deceiving. "Pacific Rim," for instance, has taken in more than $400 million worldwide -- no small feat. The picture's price tag, however, made it an everyone-or-nothing enterprise. Legendary Entertainment and Warner Brothers spent about $330 million to make and market the film, which could end its run in the red since theater owners take roughly 50 percent of ticket revenue.
With the notable exception of Paramount, which released just two films, "Star Trek Into Darkness" and the surprisingly successful "World War Z," every studio suffered at least one major dud. In many cases, big hits were offset by big flops.
Disney, for instance, had the summer's No. 1 movie in "Iron Man 3," which took in $408.6 million in North America, for a global total of $1.2 billion. Disney's Pixar also scored with "Monsters University," a prequel that generated more than $700 million in global ticket sales.
But Disney also had the summer's No. 1 box office bomb: "The Lone Ranger," which cost at least $375 million to make and market, and has taken in about $232 million worldwide. After theater owners take their cut, Disney is looking at a write-down of $160 million to $190 million on the film.
Higher-priced 3-D tickets took another tumble, at least in the United States and Canada, as more consumers decided the visual gimmick was not worth paying a $2 to $5 premium per ticket. Family films fared the worst -- those glasses don't fit little faces very well -- with "Turbo" setting a new industry low for the format, according to analysts: 3-D screenings accounted for only 25 percent of its opening-weekend results. (Last summer's low was 35 percent.)
Over the weekend, the 3-D concert documentary "One Direction: This Is Us" took in $17 million at domestic theaters, enough for first place, according to Hollywood.com, which compiles box office data. Sony, which has had a particularly rough summer, spent $10 million to make the film. A Sony spokesman on Saturday wrote in an e-mail, "We are off to a fantastic start!"
"Instructions Not Included," a Spanish-language comedy from Pantelion and Lionsgate, came out of nowhere over the weekend to take in $7.5 million at only 347 locations, an indication of the growing power of Hispanic moviegoers. "Getaway," the only other new release of note, drove into a ditch, taking in just $4.5 million. The thriller, which was released by Warner, cost about $18 million to make and stars Ethan Hawke and Selena Gomez. It was the worst-reviewed wide-release film of the summer, according to the review-aggregation site RottenTomatoes.com.
As usual, Hollywood paraded out a cavalcade of stars over the warm-weather months; as usual, only a very few emerged with their star power undiminished.
Brad Pitt pulled off "World War Z," which took in more than $527 million worldwide and proved that studios can surmount negative advance chatter if they work hard enough. Sandra Bullock and Melissa McCarthy had the No. 1 comedy with "The Heat," which took in $210 million worldwide for 20th Century Fox -- not quite "Bridesmaids" money, but not chump change, either.
At the same time, Will Smith, Johnny Depp, Ryan Reynolds, Owen Wilson, Vince Vaughn, Jamie Foxx, Channing Tatum and Matt Damon, among others, failed to turn out ticket buyers, at least to the degree that studios needed. In particular, a box office era ended when Mr. Smith's "After Earth," which cost Sony $135 million to produce and roughly $100 million to market worldwide, opened to $27.5 million in ticket sales, by far the worst summer showing of the once-infallible actor's career. Its global sales were $244 million.
Movie companies continued to make most of their profits with sequels; eight of this summer's top 12 films came from continuing franchises. And at least one major new series was born in "Man of Steel." Warner has already announced casting for a sequel to that movie, which returned Superman to theaters and took in more than $290 million in North America, for a global total of about $650 million.
But audiences also revolted against more of the same, especially if quality came up short. "The Smurfs 2," "Kick-Ass 2," "Red 2," "The Hangover Part III" and "Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters" all struggled and all received largely negative reviews.
In many ways, the summer belonged to smaller original movies, at least when it came to turning out larger-than-expected audiences.
Lionsgate's "Now You See Me," an old-fashioned midrange thriller, took in almost $300 million worldwide; it cost about $75 million to make. "This Is the End," an R-rated apocalypse comedy from Sony, cost an estimated $32 million to produce and took in $114 million. With a budget of just $3 million, "The Purge," a thriller starring Mr. Hawke, sold about $85 million in tickets for Universal.
And "The Conjuring," a horror movie that cost New Line Cinema about $20 million to make, is closing in on ticket sales of $240 million worldwide.
"Films from other genres did exceptionally well this summer, proving that counterprogramming can work," wrote Doug Creutz, an analyst at Cowen and Company, in a research note released on Thursday.
Still, Mr. Creutz did not seem to hold out much hope that Hollywood paid attention. "Looking ahead to next summer," he wrote, "it already appears as if we are likely to have another sizable batch of money-losing blockbusters."

A Rarity: A Democrat to Lead the Fed

Abstract: FOR more than a quarter century, Republicans have held a lock on two of the most important jobs in the federal government. Since Alan Greenspan became the chairman of the Federal Reserve in 1987, no Democrat has held the job, despite the election and re-election of two Democratic presidents in that time.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- FOR more than a quarter century, Republicans have held a lock on two of the most important jobs in the federal government.
Since Alan Greenspan became the chairman of the Federal Reserve in 1987, no Democrat has held the job, despite the election and re-election of two Democratic presidents in that time. The Republican hold on the office of chief justice of the United States has lasted even longer, all the way back to the 1950s.
Now President Obama seems poised to end one of those streaks -- at the Fed. His selection process so far has been dominated by debate over whether he should choose Lawrence H. Summers, a lightning rod for both criticism and admiration, or Janet Yellen, the Fed's current vice chairwoman.
Whatever their differences, though, both are clearly Democrats (as are several longer-shot candidates). Mr. Summers and Ms. Yellen have each spoken about the ills of inequality and the economic role for government.
Some parts of the Fed chairman's job are removed from those political questions, just as much of the chief justice's job involves basic bureaucracy. But for all the ways that the Fed and Supreme Court cultivate an image of technocratic remove, the ideology of their leaders still matters enormously.
At the court, the last three chief justices -- John G. Roberts Jr., William H. Rehnquist and Warren E. Burger -- have used the power to assign the writing of decisions to justices to influence those decisions' scope. The chief justice also selects which federal judges serve on special surveillance courts, and Chief Justice Roberts in particular has picked conservative Republican appointees.
At the Fed, Mr. Greenspan -- a former aide to Presidents Richard M. Nixon and Gerald R. Ford and an Ayn Rand protégé -- used the job's prestige to support George W. Bush tax cuts and changes to federal retirement benefits. He also lobbied for the repeal of financial regulations and, perhaps most famously, sidelined colleagues who wanted to crack down on easy mortgage lending.
"On a very large range of issues," Alan S. Blinder, a Democratic economist who was vice chairman under Mr. Greenspan, said, "there is a clear right-left divide."
THE Republican hold on the jobs stems in part from circumstance. After senators scuttled the nomination of Abe Fortas for chief justice -- Lyndon B. Johnson's choice to replace the liberal Republican Earl Warren -- the chance to fill the post fell to a newly elected Mr. Nixon, in 1969. Since then, each chief justice has resigned or died during a Republican presidency.
The Fed chairman's job has stayed in Republican hands partly because the party had more credibility on inflation for much of the late 20th century. Bill Clinton twice renominated Mr. Greenspan, both times in presidential-election years. Mr. Obama renominated the current chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, with the financial crisis still simmering.
The same forces that led to these renominations may now be helping Mr. Summers. While the differences between him and Ms. Yellen have at times been exaggerated, he does seem to be somewhat to her right, on monetary policy and regulation. Some aides who were advising Mr. Clinton when he selected Mr. Greenspan are now advising Mr. Obama, and it is not hard to imagine why they may see Mr. Summers as a more natural bridge from a Republican-run Fed.
Some Fed watchers think Mr. Summers may be more worried than Mr. Bernanke about the risks of the Fed's efforts to lift economic growth. But views on monetary policy do not always track neatly with ideology. Both Mr. Greenspan and especially Mr. Bernanke took positions on interest rates that might have seemed more typically liberal.
The area where politics matters most is probably regulation, Mr. Blinder noted. The next leader of the Fed will have a large role in implementing the Dodd-Frank financial regulation law. The Fed will face multiple decisions about when markets should function without interference and when regulators should try to protect consumers or deflate nascent bubbles.
Almost as intriguing, the next leader will have to decide whether to enter the political fray now and then (as Mr. Greenspan did) or avoid it (as Mr. Bernanke generally has). The most obvious topic for a Democratic Fed leader to emphasize is the sharp growth in income inequality, which many scholars think has destabilized the economy. With many families facing stretched budgets, they have taken on large debts and become less able to spend.
"I think the defining issue of our time is: Does the economic, social and political system work for the middle class?" Mr. Summers has said. Ms. Yellen, a monetary-policy expert by training, has spoken less about the topic but has described it as "disturbing."
Any modern Fed chairman is likely to use a series of boilerplate phrases about the economy -- on the importance of education and fiscal rectitude, among other things. The larger choice is whether to go further, as Mr. Greenspan did, and try to influence the country's economic debate.
Of course, avoidance is also a political decision. By waiting until the last couple of years to make plain his unhappiness with austerity, Mr. Bernanke had less impact on fiscal policy than he otherwise might have. With Congress making cuts, the Fed has had to do more work to help the economy recover.
We do not yet know how the next Fed leader will define the job. But we can be pretty confident that the person will bring a different set of beliefs than any chairman in a long time.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- FOR the past three decades, the Indian economy has grown impressively, at an average annual rate of 6.4 percent. From 2002 to 2011, when the average rate was 7.7 percent, India seemed to be closing in on China -- unstoppable, and engaged in a second "tryst with destiny," to borrow Jawaharlal Nehru's phrase. The economic potential of its vast population, expected to be the world's largest by the middle of the next decade, appeared to be unleashed as India jettisoned the stifling central planning and economic controls bequeathed it by Mr. Nehru and the nation's other socialist founders.
But India's self-confidence has been shaken. Growth has slowed to 4.4 percent a year; the rupee is in free fall, resulting in higher prices for imported goods; and the specter of a potential crisis, brought on by rising inflation and crippling budget deficits, looms.
To some extent, India has been just another victim of the ebb and flow of global finance, which it embraced too enthusiastically. The threat (or promise) of tighter monetary policies at the Federal Reserve and a resurgent American economy threaten to suck capital, and economic dynamism, out of many emerging-market economies.
But India's problems have deep and stubborn origins of the country's own making.
The current government, which took office in 2004, has made two fundamental errors. First, it assumed that growth was on autopilot and failed to address serious structural problems. Second, flush with revenues, it began major redistribution programs, neglecting their consequences: higher fiscal and trade deficits.
Structural problems were inherent in India's unusual model of economic development, which relied on a limited pool of skilled labor rather than an abundant supply of cheap, unskilled, semiliterate labor. This meant that India specialized in call centers, writing software for European companies and providing back-office services for American health insurers and law firms and the like, rather than in a manufacturing model. Other economies that have developed successfully -- Taiwan, Singapore, South Korea and China -- relied in their early years on manufacturing, which provided more jobs for the poor.
Two decades of double-digit growth in pay for skilled labor have caused wages to rise and have chipped away at India's competitive advantage. Countries like the Philippines have emerged as attractive alternatives for outsourcing. India's higher-education system is not generating enough talent to meet the demand for higher skills. Worst of all, India is failing to make full use of the estimated one million low-skilled workers who enter the job market every month.
Manufacturing requires transparent rules and reliable infrastructure. India is deficient in both. High-profile scandals over the allocation of mobile broadband spectrum, coal and land have undermined confidence in the government. If land cannot be easily acquired and coal supplies easily guaranteed, the private sector will shy away from investing in the power grid. Irregular electricity holds back investments in factories.
India's panoply of regulations, including inflexible labor laws, discourages companies from expanding. As they grow, large Indian businesses prefer to substitute machines for unskilled labor. During China's three-decade boom (1978-2010), manufacturing accounted for about 34 percent of China's economy. In India, this number peaked at 17 percent in 1995 and is now around 14 percent.
In fairness, poverty has sharply declined over the last three decades, to about 20 percent from around 50 percent. But since the greatest beneficiaries were the highly skilled and talented, the Indian public has demanded that growth be more inclusive. Democratic and competitive politics have compelled politicians to address this challenge, and revenues from buoyant growth provided the means to do so.
Thus, India provided guarantees of rural employment and kept up subsidies to the poor for food, power, fuel and fertilizer. The subsidies consume as much as 2.7 percent of gross domestic product, but corruption and inefficient administration have meant that the most needy often don't reap the benefits.
Meanwhile, rural subsidies have pushed up wages, contributing to double-digit inflation. India's fiscal deficit amounts to about 9 percent of gross domestic product (compared with structural deficits of around 2.5 percent in the United States and 1.9 percent in the European Union). To hedge against inflation and general uncertainty, consumers have furiously acquired gold, rendering the country reliant on foreign capital to finance its trade deficit.
Economic stability can be restored through major reforms to cut inefficient spending and raise taxes, thereby pruning the deficit and taming inflation. The economist Raghuram G. Rajan, who just left the University of Chicago to run India's central bank, has his work cut out for him. So do Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, also an economist, and the governing party, the Indian National Congress. These steps need not come at the expense of the poor. For example, India is implementing an ambitious biometric identification scheme that will allow targeted cash transfers to replace inefficient welfare programs.
India can still become a manufacturing powerhouse, if it makes major upgrades to its roads, ports and power systems and reforms its labor laws and business regulations. But the country is in pre-election mode until early next year. Elections increase pressures to spend and delay reform. So India's weakness and turbulence may persist for some time yet.

Abstract: The accumulating signs of economic distress -- slower growth, a widening current-account deficit, higher oil prices and rising inflation in general -- suggest that the monthlong fall of the Indian rupee in currency markets may be a symptom of fundamental troubles in the Indian economy and not just part of the broader difficulties experienced by Asian emerging market currencies in recent weeks.

Full text:   MUMBAI, India -- The statistical evidence is piling up that India's economy may be in even worse shape than had been thought.
India's economy slowed in early summer to its weakest pace since the bottom of the global economic downturn in 2009, government statistics released Friday evening showed.
The Central Statistics Office in New Delhi said that the economy grew 4.4 percent in the quarter ended June 30, well below economists' expectations of 4.8 percent. The quarter was the weakest since output grew 3.5 percent in the quarter that ended March 31, 2009.
The accumulating signs of economic distress -- slower growth, a widening current-account deficit, higher oil prices and rising inflation in general -- suggest that the monthlong fall of the Indian rupee in currency markets may be a symptom of fundamental troubles in the Indian economy and not just part of the broader difficulties experienced by Asian emerging market currencies in recent weeks.
Hints that the Federal Reserve in the United States may soon shift to a tighter monetary policy have prompted global investors to shift billions of dollars out of financial markets from São Paulo to Jakarta to Mumbai, eroding the value of local currencies in developing economies. But the Indian rupee has fallen the fastest of any emerging market currency in the last month, down 8.1 percent. Broader investor disenchantment with emerging markets has been compounded here by worries about India's economy, the third-largest in Asia after China's and Japan's.
Manufacturing and mining have been hit the hardest. A court-ordered halt to most iron ore mining across India for environmental reasons has hurt steel and other sectors; state governments have been raising taxes on the sector, and broader demand has begun to falter.
"The fact is, yes, the manufacturing sector has slowed down," said Raj K. Singh, the chairman and managing director of the Bharat Petroleum Corporation, an oil refining and marketing company that is two-thirds owned by the Indian government and is one of the country's largest businesses.
The data was released after stock market and currency trading had ended for the day, despite government promises to stay with the regular Friday morning release. After a week of considerable volatility, the rupee and the Mumbai stock market both had showed modest gains earlier Friday.
India enjoyed annual growth of 8 to 9 percent in the years leading up to the global financial crisis but has struggled to reach 6 percent since then, despite heavy government spending and large fiscal and trade deficits.
From corner stores to corporate boardrooms, the consensus in Mumbai these days is that stagnation may continue over the next few months, although almost no one expects a steep downturn.
Sitting in his office on Friday morning in front of an abstract Indian painting in blues and yellows, Mr. Singh voiced concern about a 7.2 percent drop in nationwide diesel consumption during the first three weeks of August from a year ago. Nationwide diesel consumption was also down 5.9 percent in July from a year ago.
But heavy monsoon rains have limited the need for diesel in irrigation pumps, making the comparison less clear, Mr. Singh cautioned. Rohit Dawar, the top diesel demand expert at the Petroleum Ministry in New Delhi, said in a telephone interview that diesel consumption had been artificially inflated in July and August last year by a peculiarity in government fuel subsidies, since removed, that temporarily made it cheaper to burn diesel instead of other fuels in industrial boilers.
Even allowing for all of these factors, however, "there is a slight slowdown" in diesel demand recently, Mr. Dawar said.
Plentiful monsoon rains, a key indicator for the Indian economy for thousands of years, have produced lush fields that could yet help stabilize broader measures of the economy in the coming months and forestall a steeper slowdown. While World Bank data show that value added in agriculture is only one-sixth of the economy these days, a good harvest could still play an outsize role in limiting recent increases in food prices.
Inflation will probably remain a problem, however, given that India relies almost entirely on imported oil, which becomes more expensive with each drop of the rupee. So important is oil to India's trade deficit that desperate bidding for scarce dollars by Indian refiners helped drive the rupee briefly to a record low on Wednesday, before the Reserve Bank of India stopped the rout that evening by arranging to transfer dollars from its reserves to oil importers.
"Prices are rising for everything -- petrol is more expensive, vegetables are more expensive," said Bharat Hirji Gada, a local shopkeeper.
India has some advantages compared with European and other Asian countries that have experienced steep economic downturns following currency declines over the last two decades. The biggest advantage may be that the Indian government has long prohibited borrowing in foreign currencies by poor or middle-class households and by small and medium-size businesses.
Foreign debt has been concentrated among blue-chip companies and wealthy individuals. Many of these loans are to borrowers whose revenue is largely denominated in dollars, limiting their currency exposure, said Haseeb A. Drabu, the chief economist for the Essar Group, one of India's heavy industry giants.
"The bulk of it would be hedged," he said.

Abstract: Investors have poured billions of dollars into emerging economies in recent years, as buoyant growth rates and relatively high interest rates made them attractive investments compared with the United States and Europe. Since May, however, a gradual recovery in the West and signs that the Federal Reserve would soon scale back its support of the American economy have prompted a stark shift away from emerging markets back to assets like United States Treasury securities.

Full text:   The Indonesian central bank raised its interest rates on Thursday, in a desperate effort to shore up a currency that has been badly hit by the recent sell-off in emerging markets worldwide.
The Indonesian central bank's decision, announced at a hastily called board meeting, raised the benchmark rate by half a percentage point, to 7 percent, and highlighted the increasing pressure that many of the world's largest developing economies have faced while market sentiment has withered.
Investors have poured billions of dollars into emerging economies in recent years, as buoyant growth rates and relatively high interest rates made them attractive investments compared with the United States and Europe. Since May, however, a gradual recovery in the West and signs that the Federal Reserve would soon scale back its support of the American economy have prompted a stark shift away from emerging markets back to assets like United States Treasury securities.
That shift has dragged down stocks and currencies in emerging markets, depriving them of the cash that fueled their previous growth spurts and raising the cost of crucial imports like oil.
Hit hardest have been those countries that, like Indonesia, have trade deficits and are more risky in the eyes of investors.
The benchmark Indonesian stock index has plunged more than 20 percent in the last three months, making it one of the world's worst performers over that period. Similarly, the rupiah has slumped to its lowest level since April 2009. On Thursday, it was trading at 10,935 per dollar -- down from about 9,720 in May.
Less than a week ago, the government announced a package of policy measures aimed at reducing imports and bolstering investment in labor-intensive industries.
In Brazil, which also runs a current account deficit and has had its currency plunge, the central bank announced a similar rate increase on Wednesday. That move took the benchmark Selic rate to 9 percent, from 8.5 percent.
And in India, which faces the added problem of policy gridlock before elections next year, policy makers have over the last few weeks announced a series of administrative measures aimed at narrowing the current account deficit and limiting cash outflows.
For the time being, however, such measures appear to be having limited effect, and more measures are likely to follow.
"We believe further rate hikes are needed to restore market confidence amid Indonesia's deteriorating economic fundamentals," analysts at the British bank Standard Chartered wrote in a note about the country's rate decision on Thursday.
Although rate increases could hurt economic activity, they will help to contain inflation and preserve growth momentum in household consumption and investment, they wrote.
The situation is tougher in India, where the central bank has less room to maneuver, and where a looming election next year has hampered policy making. The rupee has slumped to record lows against the United States dollar, raising concerns of a broader crisis of confidence in the country, although on Thursday the rupee gained 3.4 percent, its largest one-day gain since 1986.

Abstract: Expansion in the second quarter -- faster than the annualized growth rate in the first quarter of 1.1 percent -- was driven by gains in consumer spending, exports, private inventory investment, nonresidential fixed investment and residential fixed investment.

Full text:   The nation's economic output grew at a much faster rate in the second quarter than originally estimated, buoyed by an increase in exports.
Gross domestic product, a broad measure of goods and services produced across the economy, grew in the second quarter at an annualized rate of 2.5 percent in April through June of this year, the Commerce Department reported on Thursday. The government initially estimated G.D.P. at 1.7 percent.
The growth rate is still far lower than what the country needs to recover the ground lost during the recent recession anytime soon. The long-term average growth rate for the economy is more than 3 percent, and the economy needs above-trend growth to make up for sharp losses from the downturn.
Even so, the upward revision was welcome news, particularly alongside another report on Thursday showing that jobless claims were falling. The improving economy is also likely to factor into the Federal Reserve's decision to pull back from its stimulus efforts, which some analysts expect as soon as September.
Expansion in the second quarter -- faster than the annualized growth rate in the first quarter of 1.1 percent -- was driven by gains in consumer spending, exports, private inventory investment, nonresidential fixed investment and residential fixed investment. Residential fixed investment, which reflects the sharp rebound in housing construction, has been one of the brightest spots in the economy so far this year, growing at an annualized rate of 12.9 percent in the second quarter and 12.5 percent in the first.
The shrinking government continues to drag on the economy. State and local government spending has declined almost every quarter for the last four years, and federal government spending fell during about half of those quarters. The upward revision to gross domestic product last quarter primarily reflected the fact that exports turned out to be higher than initially estimated and imports were actually slightly lower.
"The good news is that the economy accelerated in the second quarter to a degree that was even better than expected," said James M. Baird, chief investment officer for Plante Moran Financial Advisors. "However, it's also clear that wary consumers and businesses haven't fully bought in to an imminent return to more robust growth and will not go 'all in' on spending and investment."
The revisions seemed to further convince economists that the Federal Reserve will begin tapering its large-scale asset purchases at its September meeting. The Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, has said that the central bank would slow these stimulus measures later this year, but did not specify when.
The output revisions "should give Fed officials more confidence that the recovery is gathering steam," Paul Ashworth, chief United States economist for Capital Economics, wrote in a client note. Still, he said, "it's no certainty, and August's nonfarm payroll figures will be watched closely," referring to the next jobs snapshot, due out on Sept. 6.
Economists noted that the upward revision for second-quarter G.D.P. addressed one of the puzzles in the data this year, about why hiring seemed to be picking up when output growth remained extraordinarily slow. The divergence between the two indicators did not seem sustainable, and some worried that a major slowdown in employment growth might be on the horizon.
Thursday's report "adds to the likelihood that the apparent disconnect between employment and G.D.P. will be closed with G.D.P. moving up rather than employment down," said Jim O'Sullivan, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics. "Some, but not all, of the disconnect was revised away today."
Private forecasters seem to be expecting third-quarter growth in the 2 percent range, and did not seem to think that the upwardly revised second quarter brightened the growth picture.
"We continue to judge that a significant ramp up in growth is unlikely, particularly given the ongoing effects of fiscal tightening," said Peter Newland, an economist at Barclays. Congress's across-the-board automatic spending cuts have been weighing on the economy, and further cuts may come when the Senate and House convene in September. A fight over the debt ceiling also looms.

Full text:   HONG KONG -- The turmoil in Asia's emerging economies intensified on Wednesday as potential military action in Syria fanned market anxiety and stoked oil prices.
Asian markets have been under pressure for weeks, over fears that the United States Federal Reserve will start tempering its stimulus effort. Now, investors are worried that rising oil prices could further undermine growth in the region.
With the White House contemplating a "limited" attack on Syria, the price of benchmark crude oil has jumped from about $107 a barrel at the start of this week to more than $112. The price is currently near $110.
Costlier oil will add to many Asian economies' woes by increasing import bills for companies and countries. It also threatens to fuel inflation, complicating the job of policy makers as they look to bolster growth.
India, which imports much of the oil it needs, is especially vulnerable. On Wednesday, the value of the Indian rupee fell nearly 4 percent, its steepest daily decline in years.
The slow progress on reforms in many Asian economies is causing many investors to look for better opportunities elsewhere, especially given the gradual pickup in the United States and Europe, said Andrew Sullivan, the director of sales trading at Kim Eng Securities in Hong Kong.
"A lot of cash flowed into emerging markets in the last few years as investors searched for yield," Mr. Sullivan said. Now that Western economies are showing signs of turning around, he said, these flows have been reversing. Investors "are seeking the safety of returning their cash to nearer home," he said. "It is difficult to see that changing anytime soon."
The performance of Asian markets on Wednesday highlighted the problems. Stock markets in Japan and Hong Kong both fell more than 1.5 percent. The benchmark index in the Philippines, one of the best performers in the world in 2012, sagged 3 percent.
In Thailand, the main index dropped 1.4 percent, taking its decline since late May to more than 20 percent, while the baht fell to 32.24 per United States dollar, its weakest level since March 2010. Those falls came despite soothing comments from the Thai central bank's deputy governor, Pongpen Ruengvirayudh, who said on Tuesday that the bank had "enough reserves at the moment to cover outflows and maintain economic growth including imports," Reuters reported.
In Indonesia, the rupiah fell to 10,930 per dollar, its weakest level since April 2009. Investors there are awaiting a central bank policy meeting, hastily called for Thursday, amid widespread speculation that the bank may move to raise interest rates to prop up the currency.
Policy makers in Indonesia and other emerging markets are in a tough situation. While higher interest rates might help attract renewed capital inflows, they would also raise finance costs for companies and risk stifling growth, Mr. Sullivan said. "It's a very difficult situation -- there are no easy answers to this."
In India, the recent turmoil follows years of nervousness about slowing growth and political gridlock ahead of elections next year. A persistent current-account deficit also means that the outflows from India have been especially pronounced in recent months.
As a result, the rupee has been weakening for more than two years, with especially significant moves since the Federal Reserve signaled in May that it would soon scale back its support of the American economy. On Wednesday, the rupee hit 68.77 per dollar, compared with around 55 at the beginning of the year. The rupee's weakness and higher oil prices are sharply increasing its import bills.
Many analysts and policy makers have stressed that the recent volatility does not portend another crisis of the sort that shook Asia in 1997 and 1998. Central banks' foreign exchange reserves are higher than they were back then. At the same time, more Asian debt is now in local currencies, rather than in dollars, meaning that weaker local currencies do not bring a painful increase in debt-servicing costs.
"The road may be rocky in the near term, particularly for the largest-deficit countries -- India and Indonesia -- but we don't think this is the Asian crisis all over again," Paul Gruenwald, Standard & Poor's chief economist for the Asia-Pacific region, said in a report on Wednesday.

Full text:   LONDON -- Depending on where one stands in the debate on the rising cost of housing in Britain, Paul Thomas and Abigail Walker, first-time home buyers, are either part of the solution or part of the problem.
To buy a £248,000, or $386,000, two-bedroom house in Oxfordshire, west of London, Mr. Thomas, a 38-year-old electrician, and his 25-year-old partner, Ms. Walker, who works in an accounting office, are making use of a government program called Help to Buy. Through it, they are able to make a down payment of only 5 percent from their own funds, with the government giving them an interest-free loan to cover the other 20 percent of the deposit.
The government of Prime Minister David Cameron has cast the program as a way to stimulate the country's sluggish economy by helping consumers -- skeptics might refer to them as voters -- buy homes they could not otherwise afford. But critics say it could lead to a housing bubble and a spate of problem loans on which the government could be left to make good.
Under Help to Buy, rolled out in March, the government either offers interest-free credit or guarantees part of the property loan. The resulting higher demand for homes is supposed to fuel construction and aid the economic recovery.
"Help to Buy is a dramatic intervention to get our housing market moving," George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, told Parliament in presenting the plan. "That is a good use of this government's fiscal credibility."
But over the last month, the program has drawn a growing outcry from some lawmakers and economists, demanding an early end for Help to Buy. They note that the housing market has already been picking up and warn that the plan could create a housing bubble that would be likely to burst when the program expires in 2016, while driving price increases that will make homes even less affordable for many in the meantime.
As evidence, they cite a report this month by the government statistical office that indicated that house-price inflation had risen in June at annual rate of 3.1 percent, up from 2.9 percent in May, bringing prices to the highest level in five years.
Albert Edwards, an outspoken strategist at Société Générale in London, called the British plan "madness" and "truly moronic," saying that "buyers need cheaper homes, not greater availability of debt to inflate house prices even further."
Critics also question the wisdom of enabling people to get a mortgage with a down payment of as little as 5 percent of the home value at a time when lenders are under pressure from regulators to reduce the riskiness of loans.
It also means that Britain is increasing support to the housing sector just as the United States is seeking ways to reduce the government's role and risk in the mortgage market. This month, President Barack Obama proposed winding down Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two giant government-backed mortgage finance companies.
"We do not want what the U.S. has, which is a government-guaranteed mortgage market, and they are desperately trying to find a way out of that position," Mervyn A. King told Sky News in an interview a month before he retired in July as the Bank of England governor.
The International Monetary Fund warned in May that Help to Buy would push up house prices if the government does not ensure that more houses are built. Fitch, the debt ratings agency, has raised similar concerns.
The plan as announced in March by Mr. Osborne came in two parts. The first piece, in place since April, is limited to the purchase of newly built homes. The government offers a five-year interest-free loan worth 20 percent of the home value to help pay the deposit. Mr. Thomas and Ms. Walker are getting help through that portion of the program.
The second and more controversial part of the plan, which is due to start in January, allows the buyers of any house to pay only 5 percent of the value of the home as a deposit. The government would then guarantee an additional 20 percent of the bank loan for any property worth as much as £600,000, effectively passing the risk from the lender to the government.
"Using the government's balance sheet to back these higher loan-to-value mortgages will dramatically increase their availability," Mr. Osborne said when he presented the plan to Parliament in March.
Mr. Thomas and Ms. Walker had recently moved in with Ms. Walker's mother in Oxfordshire to save money for a deposit, which they said would have taken them 10 years to come up with on their own.
But now they plan to move into their newly built home in the autumn. Instead of a £62,000 down payment on the £248,000 purchase price, they had to put down only £12,400. Help to Buy is coming up with the rest. "It really put a smile on my face," Mr. Thomas said.
Some economists said making voters like Mr. Thomas happy was the main motive for Mr. Osborne's plan. About two years before the next general election, and with recent opinion polls showing the opposition Labour Party neck and neck with Mr. Osborne's Conservative Party, Mr. Osborne is betting on the housing market. Not being able to afford a home is "a blow to the most human of aspirations," he told Parliament.
The government says the program has been a success so far. More than 10,000 people have reserved newly built homes since April, and the number of first-time buyers was at the highest level since 2007, the government said this month.
Some property developers are also happy. Barratt Developments, one of Britain's largest house builders, said sales had risen 35 percent in the three months through the end of June, from the comparable period last year, with "a significant amount" of the upturn a result of Help to Buy.
Still, those gains are coming at a time when Britain's housing market had already been improving. Helped by record low interest rates and demand from foreign buyers, especially in London, prices of homes nationwide rose 4.6 percent in the three months to July, the highest annual increase since August 2010, according to the mortgage provider Halifax. In London, the increase was 8.1 percent.
Compared with the United States or some countries in Southern Europe, Britain's housing market downturn after the financial crisis was relatively mild. House prices in Britain fell faster after their peak in 2007 but less steeply than those in the United States because of a combination of mortgage laws and a shortage of new homes.
House prices have increased so much in London that the average first-time buyer now has to spend half of his net salary on mortgage payments, according to the Nationwide Building Society. "For a market that is already clearly expensive, the government is throwing petrol on an already inflated situation," said Mr. Edwards, the Société Générale strategist.
Mr. Osborne and the Bank of England's new governor, Mark J. Carney, have rebutted criticisms of the housing program, saying Britain was still far from a housing bubble.
But behind the scenes at the Bank of England's Prudential Regulation Authority, which is charge of ensuring the safety of banks, there are concerns that Help to Buy conflicts with the regulator's aim of reducing risk in the banking sector and applying stricter lending rules, according to a senior bank official, who declined to be identified because the concerns were not public.
Banks that have signed up for the program include Lloyds Banking Group, in which the government continues to hold a stake after a bailout, along with Nationwide and Santander.
Those banks and others are in talks with the government about how much lenders will have to pay to participate in Help to Buy and how much capital the banks will have to hold for those loans.
Many economists are asking why, if banks are unwilling to take the extra risk of making such loans without government inducements, the government should be expected to backstop the program. Andrew Brigden, an economist at Fathom Consulting, said the program would make it easier for banks to make riskier loans. Help to Buy is a "reckless scheme" because it "uses public money to incentivize the banks to lend precisely to those individuals who should not be offered credit," Mr. Brigden said.
But Mr. Osborne has argued that the program is fixing a mortgage market that has been discriminating against people who can afford the monthly mortgage payments but do not have enough savings for a down payment. Passing part of the lending risk from the banks to the government does not worry him, he said.
"Because it's a financial transaction, with the taxpayer making an investment and getting a return," Mr. Osborne said, "it won't hit our deficit."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text:   It is hard to know whether to rejoice or lament two striking if somewhat conflicting messages last week about the costs of employer-sponsored health insurance.
An authoritative survey found that premiums for family and individual coverage at work -- including both the company's and the worker's share -- have gone up only moderately for the second year in a row, suggesting that health care inflation may finally be abating and that whatever costs the president's health reforms may add will be readily absorbed.
On the other hand, United Parcel Service told its white-collar workers that in an effort to reduce its health care costs, it will no longer cover some 15,000 spouses who can obtain coverage through their own employers. The company said its move was prompted primarily by projected increases in the amount it would have to pay for employees' medical care and secondarily by various costs associated with the health care reform law.
The annual survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Health Research and Educational Trust covered more than 2,000 small and large employers. It found that the average premium for employer-sponsored health insurance, typically paid mostly by employers and partly by workers, rose only 4 percent for family plans between 2012 and 2013, the same percentage increase as between 2011 and 2012. The premiums for individual policies rose 5 percent for individual workers, up from 3 percent the previous year.
Those are well below the large premium increases seen more than a decade ago. Unfortunately, they are also well above average wage growth. And on top of premium increases, many workers must cope with rising deductibles and co-payments.
Meanwhile, U.P.S. is joining a small but growing number of companies that decline to cover working spouses who can obtain coverage at their own workplace. The costs and complications of two separate policies may vary from family to family. In some cases, the plans may have different networks of doctors and offer different benefits. U.P.S. says that eliminating a spouse from a family plan could reduce the premium paid by many of its employees by enough to cover some or all of the premium the spouse will have to pay for a separate policy at another company.
Although U.P.S. is taking other steps, such as a tobacco cessation program, to improve employee health and reduce medical spending, the spousal policy will simply shift the insurance burden from U.P.S. to the other company.

Full text:   SHORTLY before Ben S. Bernanke was nominated as chairman of the Federal Reserve in 2005, he paid a return visit to Stanford, where he started his academic career in 1979. In a speech, he recalled that he and his wife, Anna, had rented a house with friends because he was certain that local real estate prices would fall. Instead, prices in the Bay Area doubled, then doubled again.
"Since then," Mr. Bernanke told his audience, "I've developed a view that central bankers should not try to determine fundamental values of assets."
Indeed, Mr. Bernanke's academic work, largely at Princeton, helped shape the conventional wisdom that central banks couldn't spot asset bubbles and shouldn't try to pop things that looked like bubbles. In his first speech as a Fed governor in 2002, he reiterated that trying to judge the sustainability of rapid increases in housing or stock prices was "neither desirable nor feasible."
Over the next several years, he said repeatedly that he saw no clear evidence of a housing bubble. And in 2004, the Bernankes paid a hefty $839,000 for a town house on Capitol Hill in Washington.
It took a great recession to change his mind. The recession, prompted by the collapse of the housing bubble that Mr. Bernanke -- and most other experts -- failed to see coming, ended an era of minimalism in central banking. And there is no better marker than the views of Mr. Bernanke, the world's most influential central banker, who now argues that the Fed needs to consider a range of previously unthinkable actions, including trying to pop bubbles when necessary, because sometimes the cost of doing nothing is worse.
Mr. Bernanke, who plans to step down in January after eight years as Fed chairman, will be remembered for helping to arrest the collapse of the financial system in 2008. This shy, methodical economist who had been expected to serve as the keeper of Alan Greenspan's flame -- to preserve the Fed's hard-won success in moderating inflation -- emerged under pressure as perhaps the most innovative and daring leader in the Fed's history.
But what Mr. Bernanke did after the crisis may prove to have even more enduring influence. For almost three decades, the Fed focused on moderating inflation in the belief that this was the best and only way to help the economy. In the wake of the crisis, Mr. Bernanke forged a broader vision of the Fed's responsibilities, starting experimental, incomplete campaigns to reduce unemployment and to prevent future crises.
The Bernanke Fed has failed to fully achieve its goals. Growth is still tepid, unemployment still too high, inflation still too low. Some critics continue to warn -- so far, incorrectly -- that its efforts will unleash inflation or destabilize financial markets.
Yet many of the Fed's experiments are already being emulated by other central banks. And Mr. Bernanke's many admirers say it is hard to imagine that anyone else could have done more under the circumstances to restore the economy. Fortunately, they say, his lifelong study of central banking under stress meant that he not only knew the available options but also understood that those options weren't enough. And he had the credibility necessary to persuade a hidebound institution to change quickly.
"It's hard to say that the Fed has accomplished what could have or should have been accomplished," said Michael Woodford, an economist at Columbia University. "Yet in the context of the difficulty of the challenges, the likelihood is that few other central bankers could have been as bold as Ben has been."

Mr. Bernanke was a rising star at Princeton in 1994 when he persuaded 953 people to elect him to a second job -- as a member of the Montgomery Township Board of Education. "I did think he was a little crazy" to add that second role, said Mark Gertler, a New York University economist who was a frequent academic collaborator with Mr. Bernanke during the 1990s.
But the move was instead an early sign of Mr. Bernanke's restlessness with the theoretical world of academia and his nascent interest in public service. And the experience helped to prepare him for larger things.
For six years, he spent several nights a month in the library of the local high school, usually dressed in a sport coat with elbow patches, calmly contributing to heated debates about building new schools in his rapidly growing community.
"When I met him he was shy and awkward," Professor Gertler said. "It developed his ability to moderate meetings and interact with people."
It is obligatory to say that Ben Shalom Bernanke was born in 1953 in Augusta, Ga., was raised in one of the few Jewish families in the small town of Dillon, S.C., and went to Harvard at the urging of friends despite the uneasiness of his parents.
But the trajectory of his adult life really began to take shape at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where his doctoral adviser, Stanley Fischer, introduced him to the work of Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz on the causes of the Great Depression of the 1930s. In Mr. Bernanke's Fed office hangs an old photograph of four central bankers who, through their failures in office, helped to make that depression so great.
Mr. Fischer also inculcated the view that government, in moderation, could improve economic outcomes -- a pragmatic middle ground in the wars between the Keynesian belief in active management and the hands-off absolutism of rational expectations theory. Mr. Bernanke is a pragmatist by nature. A baseball fan, he cheered for the Boston Red Sox until the Nationals came to Washington in 2005. He now attends Nationals games regularly.
In 2002, when Glenn Hubbard, then chairman of President George W. Bush's Council of Economic Advisers, called to gauge his interest in becoming one of the Fed's seven governors, Mr. Bernanke jumped at the chance. He had expected to be an "academic lifer" -- he still seems most comfortable when talking with college students -- but he found that he liked the practical challenges and potential impact of public service.
After his nomination was announced, he sent an e-mail to some former colleagues on the school board, according to Laurie Navin, one of the recipients.
Mr. Bernanke related that President Bush had asked him whether he had ever served in an elected position.
"It may mean nothing here, but I served on my local school board," Mr. Bernanke said he told the president. "And Bush said: 'It's good enough for me. You're in.' "
Three years later, Mr. Bush made Mr. Bernanke the first modern Fed chairman who had ever held elective office.
In his public speeches during his time as a governor, Mr. Bernanke gave a two-year master class on monetary policy, reinforcing the perception that he had the intellectual heft to succeed Mr. Greenspan. But Mr. Bernanke won the job in part by impressing Mr. Bush in a different way, according to people briefed on the selection process.
During a brief stint in the White House as an economic adviser, Mr. Bernanke had distinguished himself by his willingness to answer the president's questions by saying, "We don't really know, but here's how I think about it."
As the financial system began to fall apart on his watch, it became clear that Mr. Bernanke had other valuable qualities: an ability to remain calm under pressure and a deep historical understanding of economic crises. Shortly after joining the Fed in 2002, he promised Mr. Friedman and Ms. Schwartz that the central bank would not repeat its mistakes of the 1930s.
"You're right, we did it," he said at the time. "We're very sorry. But thanks to you, we won't do it again."
Now he urged his colleagues and staff members to set aside their habitual care and find new ways for the Fed to pump money into the financial system. Mr. Bernanke sometimes invoked President Franklin D. Roosevelt's marching orders to throw a lot of stuff at the wall and see what stuck.
"We rolled out 12 new products in 12 months," recalled the former Fed governor Kevin Warsh, who worked closely with Mr. Bernanke during the crisis period. "The Federal Reserve hadn't rolled out a single new product in a generation. But he said the Fed had to operate fundamentally differently to get through this. Because Ben was in some ways the dean of the academy in monetary policy, he realized how little we knew."
Mr. Bernanke said later that the crisis in the fall of 2008 was "the worst financial crisis in global history, including the Great Depression." He had not seen it coming; he had done nothing to soften the initial impact. But he kept his promise to Mr. Friedman and Ms. Schwartz.
It was a monumental achievement. It was also incomplete. Almost eight million Americans had lost their jobs.
Constrained by Reality
There was a time when Mr. Bernanke seemed to know exactly how a central bank should jolt a country out of an economic malaise.
In a swaggering 1999 paper, he accused Japan's central bank of lacking the will to take obvious steps to revive that nation's economy. One prescription, which earned him the nickname "Helicopter Ben," was that the Bank of Japan should agree to offset a large tax cut by buying an equivalent amount of government debt, a strategy that Mr. Bernanke compared to a "helicopter drop of newly printed money."
The point, which he repeated at his first meeting of the Fed's policy-making committee in 2002, was that central banks had plenty of ways to stimulate growth even after flooring the gas by cutting short-term rates to zero.
"I'm not one who worries about zero bounds," Mr. Bernanke declared.
Yet in the five years since the Bernanke Fed hit that zero bound in December 2008, it has not taken the drastic steps that Mr. Bernanke recommended to Japan. Instead, it has relied on two of what Mr. Bernanke once described as the least potent options available to a central bank: declaring that the Fed intends to keep short-term rates near zero until unemployment declines, and "quantitative easing" -- buying large quantities of Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities to accelerate job growth.
"During the crisis, it was clear that they were pulling out all of the stops to try to find a solution, and once the financial system stabilized and the problem was merely 10 percent unemployment, then they moved more slowly," said Laurence Ball, an economist at Johns Hopkins University, who wrote in a 2012 paper that Mr. Bernanke has lacked the courage of his convictions.
Mr. Bernanke has said that critics misunderstand the context of his writings. He was arguing that central banks always have the power to prevent deflation, as the Fed has done in recent years. He did not initially embrace the idea that the Fed should act with comparable force to spur job creation. That case was made by others, including Charles Evans, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, who called for officials to act as if their hair were on fire.
But even as he grew increasingly concerned about unemployment, and pressed for stronger action, friends and colleagues say Chairman Bernanke found himself constrained in ways that Professor Bernanke did not anticipate, and that his academic critics still don't seem to appreciate: by political realities, internal opposition and a heightened awareness of consequences.
Several of his most potent prescriptions, like the helicopter drop, require the cooperation of fiscal authorities. But Congress in recent years has shown little interest in helping to stimulate the economy. Instead, the Fed's efforts have been undermined by repeated rounds of federal spending cuts.
The Fed has also struggled to anticipate those cuts -- one reason that its stimulus campaign was only slowly expanded to its present scale. Mr. Bernanke has acknowledged that the Fed did not do enough in the first years after the crisis.
Perhaps most important, internal resistance has increased with each expansion of the Fed's stimulus campaign as officials fret that the economic benefits are shrinking even as the chances increase that something will go wrong.
"He came in as a brilliant academic -- a very smart guy with a very deep background in monetary economics -- but it was as an academic," said Donald Kohn, who served as the Fed's vice chairman under Mr. Bernanke until 2010. "And one of the things that necessarily happens to you when academic theory meets the real world is you become more aware of the limitations of the theory and the models and how you need to operate in the real world that may not function the way your models suggest that it should function."
Mr. Kohn added that, in his view, Mr. Bernanke rose to these challenges.
Last autumn, after months of quiet campaigning, Mr. Bernanke won support for two experiments that made job creation the clear focus of Fed policy. The Fed announced in September that it would buy $40 billion a month in mortgage bonds until the labor market outlook improved "substantially." In December, it said it would hold short-term rates near zero at least so long as the jobless rate remained above 6.5 percent.
Mr. Bernanke spoke of the Fed's "grave concern" about unemployment, a problem that he said should concern every American.
But many of the officials who supported the program did so tentatively, and their growing unease drove the decision for Mr. Bernanke to announce in June that the Fed intended to reduce its bond-buying before the end of the year.
Central Bank Straight Talk
On an unusually warm day in January 2012, Mr. Bernanke walked into a room filled with reporters, sat down behind a desk dressed with the Fed board of governors seal and announced that the Fed wanted inflation to be about 2 percent a year -- the first time the Fed had detailed its economic objectives so specifically.
It was a moment of his own construction. For two decades, he had been perhaps the foremost proponent of the idea that central banks could increase the power of their actions by speaking clearly about their intentions.
As a member of the board of governors, he argued publicly for the Fed to adopt an inflation target despite the opposition of Mr. Greenspan, the powerful chairman, who believed that talking about the future would constrain the Fed's flexibility.
Mr. Greenspan had quickly marginalized other academics sent to the Fed to counterbalance his dominance, but his impending retirement made it necessary to talk about other ways of running the Fed, and Mr. Bernanke carefully presented his approach as a method of bottling Mr. Greenspan's magic.
That was merely politic. Mr. Bernanke believed that making the Fed more predictable would improve its performance. He wanted it to spend more time operating on autopilot. He wanted to reduce the chairman's importance.
"The thing I think he'll be known for, if it lasts, is depersonalizing the institution," Professor Gertler said. "The idea is that the Fed has a systematic response to the economy. It's not the hunch of the chairman; it's communicating to the public clear rules of thumb for monetary policy."
Yet by the time Mr. Bernanke was able to achieve his goal, his purpose had changed. Stabilizing inflation, which he described in his first speech as Fed chairman as the primary goal of monetary policy, no longer seemed enough. Indeed, announcing the target seemed to make it easier for the Fed to suggest that it wouldn't mind if inflation rose a little above 2 percent during its campaign to spur job creation.
Paradoxically, by emphasizing communication through innovations like regular news conferences, which he introduced in April 2011, Mr. Bernanke in some ways increased the chairman's role rather than submerging it in the institution. And the emphasis on transparency remains more popular with academics than with policy makers whose roots are in the markets.
Paul A. Volcker, the former Fed chairman, has argued that transparency can encourage investors to become overconfident about the path of policy, resulting in undue risk-taking, basically because people aren't very good at minding the difference between a forecast and a promise.
When Mr. Bernanke sought earlier this year to shake some speculative excess from financial markets by announcing that the Fed intended to reduce the volume of its bond purchases, some argued that he was being forced to fix a problem created by his own communications policy.
"I think transparency in central banking is kind of like truth-telling in everyday life," Mr. Bernanke said in response. "You've got to be consistent about it."
In the weeks after his initial remarks, Mr. Bernanke and other Fed officials made the same points over and over again until they felt that they had been heard. If the Fed pulled back later this year, they said, it would be doing so only because it was finally starting to achieve its goals.
'I'm Sure You'll Miss Us'
Mr. Bernanke told The New York Times in the spring of 2010 that he had accepted a second term as Fed chairman for two reasons.
"First I wanted to see through the process of financial regulatory reform, which will have long-lasting impacts on our economy," he said. "Second, I felt that I could play a useful role in managing the exit from our extraordinary policies, including our highly accommodative monetary policies."
As he prepares to step down, the work of regulatory reform is a long way from finished and the Fed's exit remains entirely in the future.
Nonetheless, Mr. Bernanke is already starting to let the weight of the last eight years slip from his shoulders. In June, he delivered a lighthearted baccalaureate address at Princeton, looking more comfortable wearing medieval robes in a Gothic chapel than he has often looked in new suits.
"I wrote recently to inquire about the status of my leave from the university," he joked, "and the letter I got back began, 'Regrettably, Princeton receives many more qualified applicants for faculty positions than we can accommodate.' "
In July, Mr. Bernanke did not bother suppressing a snort of laughter when a senator, thanking him for his service at what may well have been his last Congressional hearing as the Fed chairman, added, "And I'm sure you'll miss us."
And, this past week, he skipped the annual late-summer gathering of central bankers at Jackson Hole, Wyo., where he had spoken in each previous year of his chairmanship.
"It really seemed that the burden of dealing with the crisis, just the way he would carry himself when you would see him, it looked like a tremendous weight," Professor Woodford said of Mr. Bernanke.
"And I hope that either because the economy recovers or he can hand off his job to someone else, I'm hoping that he does indeed become much more lighthearted again."
And who knows? Someday, he might even be able to sell his town house for a profit.

Full text:   To the Editor:
"Merge Is What Airlines Do," by Joe Nocera (column, Aug. 17), could have been titled "Go Bankrupt Is What Airlines Do." There's an old saying on Wall Street that no one has ever made money in the long run by hauling passengers.
Private rail service is a thing of the past, ocean liners as a means of transportation are gone, and Greyhound Lines operates post bankruptcy. Airlines in the United States have lost tens of billions of dollars since deregulation in 1978, a period that also saw more than 100 airlines file for bankruptcy.
Though the champions of deregulation's success like to highlight cheap airline seats and ubiquitous service, they fail to mention that those affordable seats were subsidized by shareholders and bondholders. That's no way to meet the growing needs of the flying public over the long haul.
The Justice Department could help this process along by allowing passenger carriers to take a page from the airfreight industry, which was also deregulated in 1978, by approving the merger of USAirways and American Airlines and therefore letting passenger airlines here compete successfully in the capital markets.
KEVIN C. MURPHY New York, Aug. 17, 2013
The writer is a former head of global transportation at Morgan Stanley and a former senior infrastructure fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School.
To the Editor:
When the pilot says "thank you for your patience," you can bet on a prolonged delay and missed connections.
The obvious conclusion to be drawn from the escalation in airline fares, the decline in the number of routes and the frequent delays because of inadequate aircraft maintenance is to expand and improve rail service, bringing transportation infrastructure in the United States up to a level that exists in most other developed countries.
WILLIAM A. CRAMER West Lafayette, Ind., Aug. 17, 2013
To the Editor:
Joe Nocera's column points out some basic facts that are driving airline mergers: fuel costs (about 35 percent of a ticket price) have tripled since 2000; the 9/11 security costs have in some cases been greater than the airline fare; and the industry has lost $70 billion in capital in the last decade.
Flying in the United States is still a super bargain (just look back at prederegulation fares and adjust for inflation). The American public -- and unfortunately top Washington politicians -- seem to believe that they have a divine right to fly below cost.
I wish that more domestic travelers would try a flight in Europe to find out what air travel really costs. The proposed American Airlines-USAirways merger should be approved with modifications to slots at crucial airports -- like Reagan National Airport in Washington -- and let Southwest and Jet Blue move in to undercut the legacy carriers on their monopoly or oligopoly routes.
That will keep prices in line with inflation and energy costs.
CHARLES H. GESSNER Marblehead, Mass., Aug. 17, 2013
To the Editor:
Re "U.S., Filing Suit, Moves to Block Airline Merger" (front page, Aug. 13):
I am glad that the Justice Department has finally sided with anguished travelers by filing a lawsuit to block the proposed merger of American Airlines and USAirways. With the evaporating competition in the commercial airlines industry, the customers are being burdened with escalating airfares, onerous fees and, above all, plummeting levels of service on the ground as well as on board.
The proposed merger, which would create the world's largest airline, will not alleviate air travelers' growing woes but would reduce competition and consumer choice.

Full text:   So, another BRIC hits the wall. Actually, I've never much liked the whole "BRIC" -- Brazil, Russia, India, and China -- concept: Russia, which is basically a petro-economy, doesn't belong there at all, and there are large differences among the other three. Still, it's hard to deny that India, Brazil, and a number of other countries are now experiencing similar problems. And those shared problems define the economic crisis du jour.
What's going on? It's a variant on the same old story: investors loved these economies not wisely but too well, and have now turned on the objects of their former affection. A couple years back, Western investors -- discouraged by low returns both in the United States and in the noncrisis nations of Europe -- began pouring large sums into emerging markets. Now they've reversed course. As a result, India's rupee and Brazil's real are plunging, along with Indonesia's rupiah, the South African rand, the Turkish lira, and more.
Does this reversal of fortune pose a major threat to the world economy? I don't think so (he said with his fingers crossed behind his back). It's true that investor loss of confidence and the resulting currency plunges caused severe economic crises in much of Asia back in 1997-98. But the crucial point back then was that, in the crisis countries, many businesses had large debts in dollars, so that falling currencies effectively caused their debts to soar, creating widespread financial distress. That problem isn't completely absent this time around, but it looks much less serious.
In fact, count me among those who believe that the biggest threat right now is that policy in emerging markets will overreact -- that their central banks will raise interest rates sharply in an attempt to prop up their currencies, which isn't what they or the rest of the world need right now.
Still, even if the news from India and elsewhere isn't apocalyptic, it's not the kind of thing you want to hear when the world's wealthier economies, while doing a bit better than they were a few months ago, are still deeply depressed and struggling to recover. And this latest financial turmoil raises a broader question: Why have we been having so many bubbles?
For it's now clear that the flood of money into emerging markets -- which briefly drove Brazil's currency up by almost 40 percent, a rise that has now been completely reversed -- was yet another in the long list of financial bubbles over the past generation. There was the housing bubble, of course. But before that there was the dot-com bubble; before that the Asian bubble of the mid-1990s; before that the commercial real estate bubble of the 1980s. That last bubble, by the way, imposed a huge cost on taxpayers, who had to bail out failed savings-and-loan institutions.
The thing is, it wasn't always thus. The '50s, the '60s, even the troubled '70s, weren't nearly as bubble-prone. So what changed?
One popular answer involves blaming the Federal Reserve -- the loose-money policies of Ben Bernanke and, before him, Alan Greenspan. And it's certainly true that for the past few years the Fed has tried hard to push down interest rates, both through conventional policies and through unconventional measures like buying long-term bonds. The resulting low rates certainly helped send investors looking for other places to put their money, including emerging markets.
But the Fed was only doing its job. It's supposed to push interest rates down when the economy is depressed and inflation is low. And what about the series of earlier bubbles, which, at this point, reach back a generation?
I know that there are some people who believe that the Fed has been keeping interest rates too low, and printing too much money, all along. But interest rates in the '80s and '90s were actually high by historical standards, and even during the housing bubble they were within historical norms. Besides, isn't the sign of excessive money printing supposed to be rising inflation? We've had a whole generation of successive bubbles -- and inflation is lower than it was at the beginning.
O.K., the other obvious culprit is financial deregulation -- not just in the United States but around the world, and including the removal of most controls on the international movement of capital. Banks gone wild were at the heart of the commercial real estate bubble of the 1980s and the housing bubble that burst in 2007. Cross-border flows of hot money were at the heart of the Asian crisis of 1997-98 and the crisis now erupting in emerging markets -- and were central to the ongoing crisis in Europe, too.
In short, the main lesson of this age of bubbles -- a lesson that India, Brazil, and others are learning once again -- is that when the financial industry is set loose to do its thing, it lurches from crisis to crisis.

Full text:   President Obama plans to announce a set of ambitious proposals on Thursday aimed at making colleges more accountable and affordable by rating them and ultimately linking those ratings to financial aid.
A draft of the proposal, obtained by The New York Times and likely to cause some consternation among colleges, shows a plan to rate colleges before the 2015 school year based on measures like tuition, graduation rates, debt and earnings of graduates, and the percentage of lower-income students who attend. The ratings would compare colleges against their peer institutions. If the plan can win Congressional approval, the idea is to base federal financial aid to students attending the colleges partly on those rankings.
"All the things we're measuring are important for students choosing a college," a senior administration official said. "It's important to us that colleges offer good value for their tuition dollars, and that higher education offer families a degree of security so students aren't left with debt they can't pay back."
Mr. Obama hopes that starting in 2018, the ratings would be tied to financial aid, so that students at highly rated colleges might get larger federal grants and more affordable loans. But that would require new legislation.
"I think there is bipartisan support for some of these ideas, as we've seen in states where the governors have been working on them," said the administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in order to disclose information not yet made public.
Ohio, Tennessee and Indiana have made moves toward linking aid to educational outcomes. But in the divisive Congressional atmosphere, it is not clear how much backing there would be for such proposals.
In February, the administration introduced an online college scorecard, making public some of the information to be included in the ratings, to help families evaluate different colleges. Graduates' earnings, however, will be a new data point, and one that experts say is especially tricky to make meaningful.
"There are all kinds of issues, like deciding how far down the road you are looking, and which institutions are comparable," said Terry W. Hartle, senior vice president of the American Council on Education, a group representing colleges and universities. "Ultimately, the concern is that the Department of Education will develop a formula and impose it without adequate consultation, and that's what drives campus administrators nuts."
Almost all of the federal government's $150 billion in annual student aid is distributed based on the number of students a college enrolls, regardless of how many graduate or how much debt they incur. Under the new proposal, students could still attend whatever college they chose, public or private, but taxpayer support would shift to higher-ranked schools.
With rising tuition and declining state financing, students and families are assuming a growing share of college costs. Tuition revenues now make up about half of public university revenues, up from a quarter 25 years ago. And with colleges facing larger pensions, health care and technology costs, the pressure to keep raising tuition is intense.
The average borrower now graduates with more than $26,000 of debt. Loan default rates are rising, and only about half of those who start college graduate within six years.
Mr. Obama has focused on these concerns for some time, exhorting colleges and universities, and state legislators, to make higher education more affordable.
In his 2012 State of the Union address, he said he was putting colleges on notice that if tuition did not stop rising faster than inflation, financing from taxpayers would drop. And in this year's State of the Union speech, he urged Congress to consider affordability and value in awarding federal aid, and followed up with a policy plan recommending that those measures be incorporated into the accreditation system.
Mr. Obama's proposal urges colleges to experiment with approaches that reduce costs. The plan mentions so-called competency-based degrees, in which college credits are based not on the hours students spend in classrooms, but on how much they can show they know.
Another approach mentioned in the plan is online education through what have become known as "massive open online courses," or MOOCs, which are mostly free. Mr. Obama will also urge consideration of three-year degree programs and dual enrollment programs in which high school students can begin to earn college credits.
"This isn't something that's going to be fully driven by the federal government, but the president can tell colleges that there's people out there doing good things, you should look at them, try them and try to do better -- and here's where we can help," the official said.
There is some money available for such efforts, including $500 million for community colleges, and the administration is seeking more. So far, though, it has failed to persuade Congress to pay for Race to the Top competition for higher education, under which grants would go to those colleges with promising approaches.
With or without more financing, the president plans to offer regulatory waivers to colleges that serve as experimental sites promoting high-quality, low-cost innovations in higher education, especially those that make it possible for students to get financial aid based on how much they learn, rather than how much time they spend in class. He also wants to let colleges offer Pell Grants, federal aid based on need, to high school students taking college courses.
In a letter to supporters this week, Mr. Obama said that tinkering around the edges would not be enough, and that the changes he was proposing in his two-state, three-campus tour beginning Thursday, "won't be popular with everyone -- including some who've made higher education their business -- but it's past time that more of our colleges work better for the students they exist to serve."
Mr. Obama will champion his ideas on a two-day bus tour, at town hall-style meetings on college campuses across upstate New York and Pennsylvania.
In the proposal, the president plans to change aid practices to make sure those receiving financial aid are moving toward a degree by, among other things, stretching out the disbursement of Pell Grant money over the semester, rather than giving it out in a lump sum at the start. While "satisfactory academic progress" is required by the current law, it is left to each institution to define such progress, and students who fail out of one college can simply transfer to another and receive more aid.
"That doesn't make sense," said Sandra Baum, an economist who is a senior fellow at the George Washington University Graduate School of Education and Human Development. "Students need a structure that will help them make progress."
Mr. Obama would also like to expand his existing pay-as-you-earn program for student borrowers so that borrowers could cap their payments at 10 percent of their discretionary monthly income. That expansion would require Congressional approval.
But even without it, the administration next year will direct the Education Department to call all debtors behind in their payments to make sure they understand repayment options.

Abstract: [...]among households headed by people with a bachelor's degree or more, median income declined by 6.5 percent, to $84,700. Since the end of the recession, the report said, income has declined by 3.6 percent for non-Hispanic white households, to $58,000, and by 4.5 percent for Hispanic households, to $41,000.

Full text:   Median household income has begun to recover over the last two years, but households still have not come close to regaining the purchasing power they had before the financial crisis began, a new study says.
The study, issued on Wednesday by two former Census Bureau officials, suggests why many people remain glum even though the economy is growing and unemployment has declined.
Although median annual household income rose to $52,100 in June, from its recent inflation-adjusted trough of $50,700 in August 2011, it remained $2,400 lower -- a 4.4 percent decline -- than in June 2009, when the recession ended. This drop, combined with the 1.8 percent decline that occurred during the recession, leaves median household income 6.1 percent -- or $3,400 -- below its level in December 2007, when the economic slump began.
Since the end of the recession, the study said, household income has declined for all but a few population groups. Some of the largest percentage declines occurred for groups whose income was already well below the median, like African-Americans, Southerners, people who did not attend college, and households headed by people under age 25.
"Groups with low incomes tended to have steeper declines in income," said Gordon W. Green Jr., who wrote the report with John F. Coder, a colleague at Sentier Research, which specializes in analyzing household economic data.
Households headed by people ages 65 to 74 were the only group in the study that experienced a statistically significant increase in post-recession income, helped perhaps by the decision of some older workers to remain in the work force or re-enter it.
The figures, adjusted for changes in the cost of living over time, include income before taxes and exclude capital gains. The number of households with income above the median is the same as the number below it.
The data offers a potential preview of the official Census Bureau statistics on income and poverty for 2012, scheduled to be released next month. The Sentier data is based on the Current Population Survey, a monthly government survey of about 50,000 households. The researchers used the same definition of income as the Census Bureau uses in its annual report on income and poverty. The two sets of estimates have shown broadly similar trends in recent years.
Because recessions rarely match up with calendar years, the annual census data often does not allow for precise comparisons with the start and end of downturns. The most recent downturn ended in June 2009, according to a panel of academic economists widely considered to the arbiter of the business cycle.
The economy has been growing since 2009, but more slowly and inconsistently than many Americans would like and many economists and policy makers had predicted. President Obama has made the economy's condition his main focus this summer, promising new efforts to encourage economic growth, including a series of proposals on higher education that he is expected to announce Thursday. While taking credit for some improvement in the economy, he has acknowledged that many Americans have yet to see the benefits.
"We've got more work to do," Mr. Obama said last month at Knox College in Galesburg, Ill. "Even though our businesses are creating new jobs and have broken record profits, nearly all the income gains of the past 10 years have continued to flow to the top 1 percent. The average C.E.O. has gotten a raise of nearly 40 percent since 2009. The average American earns less than he or she did in 1999."
In the recession and its aftermath, many people went back to school, earning associate or bachelor's degrees. Such credentials have helped, the new data shows, but they have been no guarantee against loss of income.
Households headed by people with only a high school diploma have seen their post-recession income decline by 9.3 percent, to $39,300 in June of this year, the report said. For households headed by people with an associate degree, median income declined by 8.6 percent in those four years, to $56,400. And among households headed by people with a bachelor's degree or more, median income declined by 6.5 percent, to $84,700.
Since the end of the recession, the report said, income has declined by 3.6 percent for non-Hispanic white households, to $58,000, and by 4.5 percent for Hispanic households, to $41,000. Those changes were smaller than the 10.9 percent decline, to $33,500, for non-Hispanic black households, whose economic problems are likely to be a focus when Mr. Obama speaks next week on the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington.
Median income for households headed by people ages 65 to 74 increased by 5.1 percent, to $43,000, even though in many cases the head of the household was retired. By comparison, median income for households headed by people under age 25 fell 9.6 percent, to $31,300.
Median income declined by 4.5 percent for households headed by a person 25 to 34 years old, by 5.7 percent for those 35 to 44, by 2.5 percent for those 45 to 54, and by 7 percent for those 55 to 64. The report found no significant change for households headed by a person 75 or older.
Median income declined for households in three of four geographic regions, with the South showing the largest decline and the Midwest reporting no statistically significant change.
From June 2009 to June of this year, household income declined by 6.2 percent in the South, to $47,900; by 5.2 percent in the West, to $56,400; and by 3.9 percent in the Northeast, to $56,800.
By contrast, household income in the Midwest, $52,600, was not significantly different from what it was four years ago. Some parts of the Midwest have been helped by the natural-gas boom, while others have benefited from a modest manufacturing rebound in the last few years.

Abstract: [...]employers have been asking workers to pay higher deductibles and be more selective "My general sense is it's too early to take what's happening with health care spending, whether it's for good or bad, and assign it to the A.C.A.," said Martin S. Gaynor, a professor of economics and health policy at Carnegie Mellon University.

Full text:   Premiums for employer-provided health insurance have increased by relatively modest amounts this year, according to a new survey, a further sign that once-torrid health care inflation has abated for now.
The average annual premium for a family rose 4 percent in 2013, to $16,351, according to the survey results released Tuesday by the Kaiser Family Foundation. Annual premiums for individual policies purchased through an employer rose 5 percent, to $5,884.
The 4 percent increase for a family is relatively tame, at least compared with the roughly 10 percent annual increases experienced a decade ago. But it is still a far bigger rise than 1.8 percent increase in wages and the 1.1 percent rate of inflation in the last year, the foundation said.
"If you are comparing it to 10 years ago in health care, it seems modest," said Helen B. Darling, chief executive of the National Business Group on Health, which represents large employers. "If you compare it to the economy and what inflation is doing, I don't think it's modest at all."
The data also suggest that the new health care law is not leading, at least so far, to a rapid escalation of insurance costs.
"The critics will have a much harder time blaming big premium increases in employer insurance on Obamacare this year, because there aren't any big premium increases," Drew Altman, chief executive of the Kaiser foundation, said in a telephone news conference Tuesday.
Conversely, however, it is not clear if the Affordable Care Act, as the law is formally known, has contributed to the moderating of premium increases, Kaiser researchers said.
Premiums have been held in check partly by increasing out-of-pocket costs that workers pay through co-payments and deductibles.
The survey found that 78 percent of covered workers have a general deductible, up from 72 percent in 2012. About 38 percent of covered workers now face a deductible of at least $1,000. At companies with fewer than 200 employees, 58 percent of covered workers have a deductible that large, with 31 percent having a deductible of at least $2,000, up from 12 percent in 2008.
"It's part of what I see as a quiet revolution in health insurance, from more comprehensive to less comprehensive, with higher deductibles," said Dr. Altman, who added that that should appeal to conservatives. "The vision of insurance that they've always favored, with more skin in the game, is the one that's coming to dominate in the marketplace."
While out-of-pocket costs are going up, the proportion of total premiums paid by workers out of their paychecks did not change in the last year, Kaiser said. On average workers paid $4,565, or about 28 percent, of the average family premium and $999, or 17 percent, of the average individual premium.
The survey results showed that employers are not dropping health benefits and forcing their employees to seek coverage on the new exchanges being set up under the Affordable Care Act.
About 57 percent of all companies are offering health benefits this year compared with 61 percent last year, a difference that was not statistically significant. Among companies with three to nine workers, 45 percent offered some benefits compared with 50 percent in 2012, a decline that also was not statistically significant.
The 4 percent increase in family premiums in 2013 was similar to the increase in 2012 and in most of the last several years. But since 1999, premiums have nearly tripled while wages have gone up only 50 percent and consumer prices only 40 percent.
The slower increase in premiums appears to reflect slower growth of health care spending in general that is partly explained by people forgoing visits to doctors and medical procedures because of the bad economy.
There is a debate about whether the Affordable Care Act is contributing to the moderation. It has not gone into effect fully yet, but some health care providers might already be cutting costs in anticipation. At the same time, employers have been asking workers to pay higher deductibles and be more selective
"My general sense is it's too early to take what's happening with health care spending, whether it's for good or bad, and assign it to the A.C.A.," said Martin S. Gaynor, a professor of economics and health policy at Carnegie Mellon University.
Kaiser conducted the survey of more than 2,000 companies of various sizes, with the Health Research and Educational Trust, which is affiliated with the American Hospital Association.
A separate survey that will be released Wednesday, commissioned by the Commonwealth Fund, has found that an estimated 7.8 million young adults are insured because of the Affordable Care Act provision allowing them to be covered by their parents' plan.
The survey found that, contrary to common perceptions, many young adults, age 19 to 29, are interested in health insurance. But it also found that only 27 percent were aware of the new state health insurance marketplaces that are starting Oct. 1.

Abstract: Mr. Bernanke's supporters say he has done his best with monetary policy while a do-nothing Congress has offered no help through fiscal policy. Supporters say Mr. Bernanke has made up for his lack of prescience before the Great Recession through his bold emergency rescue actions, coordinated with President George W. Bush and then President Obama, and his willingness to do "whatever it takes" to get the economy moving, despite the potential risks of inflation down the road.

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDEDMEDFORD, Mass. -- THE debate over who should succeed Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, has been exceptionally personality-driven. Supporters and opponents of the two leading contenders -- Lawrence H. Summers, a former Treasury secretary and adviser to President Obama, and Janet L. Yellen, a Clinton administration veteran like Mr. Summers, and now the Fed's vice chairwoman -- have been feuding in public. Mr. Obama has called the decision, which is expected soon, one of the most important of his presidency.
What all sides seem to misunderstand, however, is the proper nature of the central bank's role in the economy. Instead of casting about for a new maestro, we need to return the Fed to dullness and its chairman to obscurity.
The Fed has become anything but boring. Under Mr. Bernanke and his predecessor, Alan Greenspan, it didn't foresee the housing bubble, much less try to pop it. Even if the Fed could identify bubbles, Mr. Bernanke once said, "monetary policy is too blunt a tool for effective use against them."
Yet for more than four years, the Fed has used this blunt instrument on an unprecedented scale. It is currently buying $85 billion in Treasury and mortgage-backed securities every month, the third round of a strategy, known as quantitative easing, that aims to stimulate the economy by keeping interest rates low.
Mr. Bernanke's supporters say he has done his best with monetary policy while a do-nothing Congress has offered no help through fiscal policy. But quantitative easing has amounted to an audacious experiment in trickle-down economics. Among other things, it has artificially boosted the stock market in the hope that enriching a few -- the top 1 percent of American households owned 42 percent of the nation's financial assets in 2010 -- will help the many. Meanwhile, retirees who don't dare buy stocks have seen their modest bank deposits stagnate with interest rates near zero (despite a recent significant increase in Treasury yields).
Economists hate to admit it, but the profession is as much faith as science. "If we speak frankly," John Maynard Keynes once wrote, "we have to admit that our basis of knowledge for estimating the yield 10 years hence of a railway, a copper mine, a textile factory, the goodwill of a patent medicine, an Atlantic liner, a building in the City of London amounts to little and sometimes to nothing; or even five years hence." Even in medicine, where double-blind experiments with control groups are de rigueur, the evidence of efficacy is far from ironclad; for economic policy, it is even less so.
Supporters say Mr. Bernanke has made up for his lack of prescience before the Great Recession through his bold emergency rescue actions, coordinated with President George W. Bush and then President Obama, and his willingness to do "whatever it takes" to get the economy moving, despite the potential risks of inflation down the road.
But wittingly or not, the mild-mannered Mr. Bernanke has made his job even more prominent than it was under Mr. Greenspan's 19-year tenure. Such concentration of power within the Federal Reserve Board in Washington is precisely what Congress did not intend when it created the central bank in 1913.
The Fed's chairmen in recent decades have been eminently qualified individuals of undisputed probity. But they are humans, too, whose blind spots, egos and potential conflicts of interest -- Mr. Greenspan has had a lucrative post-Fed career giving speeches and advice -- raise real concerns about hubris, even bias. The solution is not to subject the Fed to the whims of a dysfunctional Congress but rather to scale back what we can expect of it.
Counting on monetary policy to secure full employment is like attempting vascular surgery with a dull ax. Diversity and dynamism are vital features of our economy. As home building in Nevada collapsed, fracking in North Dakota boomed. Facebook and Apple surged while AOL and Yahoo stumbled. Across-the-board interest-rate suppression is just as likely to pump up already surging sectors as it is to revive slumping ones. Property prices have soared in Manhattan, while Detroit is in a death spiral.
Commanding the Fed to eliminate price fluctuations is also asking too much. The prices of bananas can fluctuate even across neighboring supermarkets. Each of us has our own consumption basket and inflation rate. The overall inflation rate is important -- as Mr. Greenspan's predecessor, Paul A. Volcker, demonstrated in the early 1980s when he crushed inflation at the cost of painful, back-to-back recessions -- but only at the extremes.
Where the Fed must be held more accountable is for its oversight of banks. It is banks, not the government, that effectively create most of the money we use, by extending credit where it is most needed. As we've painfully learned, banks can over-lend and even set off an economic collapse.
Before the crisis the Fed seemingly lost all capacity for the painstaking, boots-on-the-ground supervision of the banks under its purview. And, effective or not, top-down monetary interventions remain attractive to the Fed's top brass. Running what amounts to a hedge fund on steroids is more glamorous and exciting than managing a regulatory bureaucracy. Perhaps the most important qualification for the next Fed leader is one all too rare in Washington: humility.
Correction: August 23, 2013, Friday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An Op-Ed article on Wednesday about the search for a new Federal Reserve chairman referred imprecisely to the central bank's bond purchases. The Fed is buying $85 billion a month in Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities -- not just Treasuries.

Abstract: Or, going all-out crazy, you could cut the personal income tax bill of every city taxpayer by $4.47, according to the calculations of the city's Independent Budget Office. The city lawyers still get paid, of course; they worked hard, they had desks and computers, pensions and health care plans, vacations and bosses and secretaries and paralegals, heat in the winter and air-conditioning in the summer.

Full text:   Suppose you were in charge of New York City and had $10 million to spend. That's enough money to repave 65 miles of streets, or pay for 80 police officers or 159 teachers, or cover the cost of 887 seats in Head Start.
Or, going all-out crazy, you could cut the personal income tax bill of every city taxpayer by $4.47, according to the calculations of the city's Independent Budget Office.
Another way to spend that money is fighting lawsuits with scorched-earth litigation tactics.
Here is a letter from a federal official dated Aug. 9, 2004, offering the city a way to avoid expensive litigation over claims that the city's Fire Department had discriminated against black applicants. The official, Electra Yourke of the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, wrote that she was worried that a formal process known as conciliation would fail before it even got started. "As of this date, I have not even been able to convene a meeting with" city representatives, she wrote, listing possible solutions.
The city wanted none of them, and a year and a half later, brought the discussions to an end.
"I write to confirm our telephone conversation earlier this month," Georgia Pestana, a city lawyer, said in a letter on Dec. 27, 2005. The city "declines to conciliate."
And that brought in the Justice Department, which filed a lawsuit in support of the people who had charged the city with discrimination.
In 2013, the case is still rattling through the federal courts. A judge ruled against the city and appointed a monitor; the city appealed and won back a bit of ground. But most of the findings remained intact.
So the lawyers for the people who sued are going to court to have their legal fees paid, to which they are entitled if the judge agrees that they are the "prevailing" party.
"We asked for $8 million in fees, and $500,000 in expenses," said Darius Charney, a staff attorney with the Center for Constitutional Rights, which provided some of the lawyers for the winning side.
The city will haggle over how much is owed, whether the hourly rate should be $525 an hour or $450, and so forth. So the city's bill will not necessarily be all $8 million claimed.
But wait: what about the losers -- the city Law Department?
The city lawyers still get paid, of course; they worked hard, they had desks and computers, pensions and health care plans, vacations and bosses and secretaries and paralegals, heat in the winter and air-conditioning in the summer.
So whatever amount the winning side gets -- let's say it ends up at $5 million -- you can roughly guess that the losing side will have already paid that much, too, for its own costs. There's your $10 million to play with. Or more than 30 miles of new pavement and 400 seats in Head Start.
Why wasn't this case settled? The mayor, Michael R. Bloomberg, has said the city was fair in its testing.
"We tried to do a conciliation, but the city refused to participate," Mr. Charney said.
Under Mr. Bloomberg and Michael A. Cardozo, the corporation counsel, the city has generally refused to enter into consent decrees -- lawsuit settlements overseen by the courts. These, it was argued, unwisely limited the authority of managers. They stifled innovation. Experts would be second-guessed. And the city was not discriminating -- or so it argued over and over.
Given an opportunity to avoid the litigation that went on for years over the police stop-and-frisk practices and which recently concluded with a stunning loss, the city chose to fight, at enormous cost. Here's the missed chance: The city agreed in 2003 to settle a racial-profiling lawsuit that had been filed in 1999, under the previous administration.
When the terms of that settlement were expiring in 2007, the stop-and-frisk numbers were just becoming public. The city declined to continue the oversight terms of the previous settlement. "The city bought themselves a new lawsuit," said Chris Dunn, a lawyer with the New York Civil Liberties Union. "They could have extended the terms for a couple of years, which would have been a low-cost, no-cost proposition."
Since Mr. Bloomberg took office, the budget for the city's Law Department has increased by more than 56 percent -- almost double the rate of inflation, and much faster than nearly all city agencies except for the Education Department.
The stop-and-frisk litigation costs will certainly run into multimillion-dollar sums. Asked how much the case has cost the city so far, a spokeswoman for Mr. Cardozo said the number was not at hand.
Miles and miles of street paving, to be sure.

Full text:   Lawmakers and central bankers in India, Indonesia, Turkey and several emerging-market economies are scrambling to contain the damage from falling currencies and to keep foreign investors from heading for the exits.
Money has poured out of those economies over the last few weeks, pushing down the prices of a wide array of assets, including stocks, bonds and currencies. On Tuesday, the Indian rupee fell to a record low against the dollar, while the Indonesian rupiah dropped to its lowest level against the dollar since 2009.
In an effort to slow the exodus of foreign money from Turkey, the country's central bank raised a key interest rate on Tuesday. That came as the Reserve Bank of India announced that it would start buying Indian government bonds later this week to "address the risks to macroeconomic stability."
"At this point in time I personally see the current government is completely in panic," said Arvind Singhal, the chairman of Technopak Advisors, a consulting firm in Delhi. The strengthening of the American economy appears to be one of the catalysts for the problems in the emerging economies. A booming United States stock market has been a magnet for investors who might have otherwise invested in overseas stocks.
More important, the American economic recovery is causing the Federal Reserve to reconsider the need for the stimulus measures that have fueled the boom in places like India and Turkey.
Many of these nations fueled their economic growth with an unprecedented flow of money from foreign investors. Those investors, in turn, were encouraged by the low-interest-rate policies of the Fed, which made it easy to borrow money and send it abroad.
Last year, $1.2 trillion poured into emerging economies from around the world, nearly six times the amount going in just a decade ago, according to a report out Tuesday from HSBC.
As the Fed is taking the first steps toward letting rates rise in the United States, investors are pulling back their money. As they do, the local economies worsen, setting off a self-perpetuating cycle of market drops. Mutual funds that hold emerging market bonds, for example, have seen investors pull out money every single week since May, according to the data firm EPFR.
The sell-offs have recalled some of the emerging market crises of previous decades.
Many analysts say they believe that even the most troubled countries are insulated from that sort of economic collapse, but the optimism that was common a few years ago has largely dried up.
"I don't see any near-term positive indicators out there for investors to start piling back into emerging markets," said Kevin Daly, who invests in emerging markets debt for Aberdeen Asset Management in London.
The experiences in many emerging markets are the flip side of the economic situation in the United States, where the economic data has been improving.
In the United States, the stock markets closed Tuesday with little change. Both the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and the Nasdaq composite index rose modestly, while the Dow Jones industrial average slipped slightly. The S.& P. 500 gained 6.29 points, or 0.4 percent, to close at 1,652.35. The Nasdaq picked up 24.50 points, or 0.7 percent, to close at 3,613.59. The Dow fell 7.75 points, to 15,002.99.
The most acute problems in the emerging markets began in May, when Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, gave the first signals that the Fed might begin trimming back the bond purchases it had been making to support the economy. Since then, a wide array of global assets have moved in tandem with forecasts of how soon the Fed might slow the bond purchases.
The changes at the Fed, though, have not hit evenly across the developing world. Initially, the hardest hit countries were those that were also exposed to an economic slowdown in China. Australia, which relies heavily on exports of commodities to China, fell sharply earlier in the summer.
The fear that Indonesia may not be able to continue attracting that money helped push the main stock index in Jakarta down 3.2 percent on Tuesday. Over the last month, the index has dropped 11.6 percent.
The most urgent fears have centered around India, where the economy is more than twice as large as Indonesia's, and where the current account deficit is projected to be more than twice as big this year.
Investors have sold 24 percent of the money they had in Indian bonds since May, according to a Credit Suisse analysis of Indian government figures. All of that money leaving the country makes the national currency, the rupee, worth less.
For ordinary Indians, the falling value of the rupee has quickly made foreign goods more expensive, fanning inflation.
Indian lawmakers have taken a number of steps aimed at stemming the tide of money rushing out of the country. The government has tried to limit the amount of investments Indian companies can make overseas, and has also tried to curtail purchases of gold and silver from abroad. All of these measures, though, have appeared to make the problems worse.
"Initially the government just tried to talk their way through by saying everything is all fine, but it did not work," Mr. Singhal, the consultant, said. "Then they get into active intervention in the market, but that hasn't worked either"
Central bankers are in a somewhat difficult position because in order to keep more money in the country and tame inflation, interest rates need to rise. But higher interest rates make it harder for local companies to borrow, potentially limiting economic growth. That is leading to unusual measures like the bond-buying program that the Indian central bank announced Tuesday.
Some Indians are pinning their hopes on the arrival of Raghuram Rajan, a highly regarded University of Chicago economics professor who is set to take over the helm of the Reserve Bank of India in September.
But many economists say they believe that the problems are unlikely to significantly improve before the national elections bring in a new government next year.
"As a patriot, I'd definitely say they should be able to" stabilize the currency, said Ajay Chaturvedi, the founder of a HarVa, an Indian outsourcing firm. "But I don't think as a finance guy that they'll be able to."
In the bond market in the United States on Tuesday, the price of the Treasury's 10-year note rose 17/32, to 97 8/32. Its yield dropped to 2.82 percent, from 2.88 percent late Monday.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text:   LIMA, Peru -- From his office window, Henrik Kristensen, the chief executive of the company that runs Peru's main port, can still look out at rows of newly arrived, shiny Kia automobiles from South Korea and shipping containers stacked four high, full of imported items like television sets and brand-name clothing bound for the growing number of malls that serve this country's burgeoning middle class.
"This is Peru," he said. "When you go to the shopping malls they're full of people, they're full. That's a good indicator that people are really spending money."
Peru's economy grew an average of 6.4 percent a year from 2002-12 after adjusting for inflation, according to government figures, a remarkable period of sustained expansion that has made it one of the world's star economies.
But suddenly growth has slowed here, and just beyond the view from Mr. Kristensen's window, under Lima's perpetually gray winter sky, the reason becomes clear.
At Dock 5B, ships are loaded with Peru's mining riches, including copper ore, lead and zinc -- the raw materials that fueled the Peruvian boom with their rising prices in recent years. But in the first six months of this year, mineral shipments through the port were down 12 percent by weight, according to APM Terminals, Mr. Kristensen's company, which operates the facility for the Peruvian government.
The decrease resulted from a drop in demand in a struggling world economy and a slowdown in China, one of Peru's top trading partners. Those factors have also caused mineral prices to plummet, sucking the wind from the sails of Peru's economy.
This bust amid the boom has given vent to a national angst, with hand-wringing over the economy a mainstay of newspaper front pages and television news programs. Headlines bemoan soaring trade imbalances as the value of mining and other exports, including apparel and agricultural products, plunges at the same time imports are surging.
Miguel Castilla, the economy and finance minister, said he expected the economy to grow between 5.5 percent and 6 percent this year. While that was down from earlier predictions, it would maintain Peru's place as one of the fastest-growing economies in Latin America. Even some of the most skeptical economists predict Peru's economy will grow by nearly 5 percent this year, a rate that would be celebrated as a ripping success in many countries.
But in Peru, such predictions are being treated as something close to disaster.
"Growing for a decade at 6 percent, you get used to it," said Gustavo Yamada, the dean of economics at the University of the Pacific in Lima. Mr. Yamada said he expected growth in Peru to settle into a range of about 4 percent to 5 percent in coming years.
"That creates a scenario," he said, "of, 'Hey, wait a minute, we were going to be the next Inca tiger, what a disappointment.' "
Polls show that consumer confidence has slipped this year, and a Peru Central Bank survey in June showed that investor confidence was at its lowest point in almost two years.
"We have become used to a sustained period of growth, and we have forgotten about cycles," said Mr. Castilla, the economic minister.
Just as outside factors, like rising metals prices, fueled Peru's boom, similar factors, like the slow recovery in the United States, Europe's economic woes and China's slowdown, are now causing it to cool down, he said.
"We're at a crossroads," Mr. Castilla said. "We have everything we need to cope with this less favorable world condition, but there's an urgent need to implement the reforms that have been approved recently and to tackle other issues."
Those changes include steps to clear away economic obstacles -- like making government more efficient, making capital markets work better and improving infrastructure.
Mr. Castilla's ministry has also chosen a list of 31 projects worth $22 billion, including mining and infrastructure, that it wants to fast-track by removing bureaucratic obstacles.
Peru's economy is a mash-up of strengths and weaknesses. The country has robust international reserves, a large rainy day fund that can be used for economic stimulus in a crisis, and low public debt.
Poverty in Peru has been cut by more than half in recent years, falling from 59 percent of the population in 2004 to 26 percent last year, according to government figures. Millions have moved into the middle class, which the Inter-American Development Bank estimates has doubled in size from 2007-12 and now includes about half of all Peruvian families.
But the new prosperity is unevenly distributed, concentrated in the cities and along the coast. More than half of those in rural areas still live in poverty, especially in the Andes and the Amazon basin. Lima also remains home to vast slums.
The education system is poor, millions still lack access to adequate water and sewer connections, and there are myriad infrastructure bottlenecks.
The port, in an area known as Callao, illustrates some of these challenges. It is undergoing a $750 million modernization paid for by APM Terminals, which took over the running of the facility from the government two years ago.
But the road into the port is choked with trucks waiting to pass through the facility's single gateway. Farther inland, the highways needed to get goods to and from the port are often treacherous.
Peru's economy is heavily dependent on mining. The nation is the world's third-largest producer of copper and silver and the sixth-largest producer of gold, according to the United States Geological Survey. And despite talks of diversification, President Ollanta Humala is pinning his hopes for sustained growth on mining.
Several new copper mines are scheduled to begin producing over the next few years, which could double the country's output. But gold mining, which accounts for a large share of the value of mine exports, has declined as mines have become tapped out, and protests have stalled a major new gold-mining project, known as Conga, in the Cajamarca region.
The total volume of Peru's mineral exports in the first half of this year was about equal to that of the same period in 2012, but because of lower prices, their value fell by more than 15 percent, according to the Exporters Association, a trade group in Peru.
All this is coming at an awkward time for Mr. Humala, whose approval rating slid from more than 50 percent early this year to 33 percent in a recent poll. Halfway through his four-year term, Mr. Humala is seen by many as a bland president who struggles to inspire, seemingly lurching from crisis to crisis.
He was criticized for his unsmiling performance on July 28 when he read his annual Independence Day speech, the equivalent of Peru's state of the nation address. Several commentators said he had wasted an opportunity to rally the country and sound an optimistic note on the economy.
This week, Mr. Humala told the country that "the world is going through a tremendous economic crisis," according to local media reports. "The crisis has come to Peru."
Mr. Humala, a former military officer, started his political career as a leftist and at one stage modeled himself on Hugo Chávez, the fiery former president of Venezuela. But to win election in 2011, he moved to the center and pledged to keep the country on its economic course.
He also promised to bring the benefits of Peru's economic growth to the millions who have been left out. While he has created or bolstered some social programs, many of his onetime backers on the left feel betrayed. A new Civil Service law that includes evaluations of public employees brought angry protests from unions last month.
And while many in the business community are relieved that he has not made major changes in economic policy, their trust appears thin. When Mr. Humala's government said in April that it was considering buying a stake in the Peruvian operations of the Spanish oil company Repsol, it was met with a storm of protest and quickly backtracked.
Carlos González, an economist with the Exporters Association, said Peru's economic deceleration was being overdramatized, but he added that Peru would have to work harder to maintain growth and to attract investors as outside conditions changed.
"We were the prettiest girl in the neighborhood who could get the best boyfriend," he said. "It seems we've passed that moment."

Abstract: The government has followed with a series of increasingly desperate policy announcements in recent weeks in hopes of turning things around, including an increase in import duties on gold and silver and attempts to defend the currency without raising interest rates too high. The Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, has recently responded to the rupee's weakness by raising interest rates, but those moves have already begun to hurt a huge swath of India's corporate sector.

Full text:   NEW DELHI -- For the last 10 years, India seemed poised to take its place alongside China as one of the dominant economic and strategic powerhouses of Asia. Its economy was surging, its military was strengthening, and its leaders were striding across the world stage.
But a summer of difficulties has dented India's confidence, and a growing chorus of critics is starting to ask whether India's rise may take years, and perhaps decades, longer than many had hoped.
"There is a growing sense of desperation out there, particularly among the young," said Ramachandra Guha, one of India's leading historians.
Three events last week crystallized those new worries. On Wednesday, one of India's most advanced submarines, the Sindhurakshak, exploded and sank at its berth in Mumbai, almost certainly killing 18 of the 21 sailors on its night watch.
On Friday, a top Indian general announced that India had killed 28 people in recent weeks in and around the Line of Control in Kashmir as part of the worst fighting between India and Pakistan since a 2003 cease-fire.
Also Friday, the Sensex, the Indian stock index, plunged nearly 4 percent, while the value of the rupee continued to fall, reaching just under 62 rupees per dollar, a record low.
Each event was unrelated to the others, but together they paint a picture of a country that is rapidly losing its swagger. India's growing economic worries are perhaps its most challenging.
"India is now the sick man of Asia," said Rajiv Biswas, Asia-Pacific chief economist at the financial information provider IHS Global Insight. "They are in a crisis."
In part, the problems are age-old: stifling red tape, creaky infrastructure and a seeming inability to push through much-needed changes and investment decisions. For years, investors largely overlooked those problems because of the promise of a market of 1.2 billion people. Money poured into India, allowing it to paper over a chronic deficit in its current account, a measure of foreign trade and investment.
But after more than a decade of largely futile efforts not only to tap into India's domestic market but also to use the country's vast employee base to manufacture exports for the rest of Asia, many major foreign companies are beginning to lose patience. And just as they are starting to lose heart, a reviving American economy has led investors to shift funds from emerging-market economies back to the United States.
The Indian government recently loosened restrictions on direct foreign investment, expecting a number of major retailers like Walmart and other companies to come rushing in. The companies have instead stayed away, worried not only by the government's constant policy changes but also by the widespread and endemic corruption in Indian society.
The government has followed with a series of increasingly desperate policy announcements in recent weeks in hopes of turning things around, including an increase in import duties on gold and silver and attempts to defend the currency without raising interest rates too high.
Then Wednesday night, the government announced measures to restrict the amounts that individuals and local companies could invest overseas without seeking approval. It was an astonishing move in a country where a growing number of companies have global operations and ambitions.
The Indian stock markets were closed Thursday because of the nation's Independence Day, but shares swooned at Friday's opening. Many analysts are predicting that the markets will continue to decline.
"I think things will get much worse before they get better," said Sonal Varma, an India economist at Nomura Securities in Mumbai. "The government is between a rock and a hard place."
The problem for India, analysts say, is that the country has small and poorly performing manufacturing and mining sectors, which would normally benefit from a weakening currency. Meanwhile, India must buy its oil, much of its coal and other crucial goods like computers in largely dollar-denominated trades that have become nearly 40 percent more expensive over the past two years.
That is helping feed inflation, which jumped in July to an annual rate of 5.79 percent from 4.86 percent in June, far above what analysts had expected.
The Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, has recently responded to the rupee's weakness by raising interest rates, but those moves have already begun to hurt a huge swath of India's corporate sector. Growth rates had already slowed to 5 percent in the most recent quarter, and India now has a far harder time meeting its current-account deficit.
Analysts fear that higher inflation, softening growth, a falling currency and waning investor confidence could spin into a vicious cycle that will be difficult to contain.
"There's a risk of a spiral downward," said Mr. Biswas, the IHS Global economist. "It will be very hard to break."
The submarine explosion revealed once again the vast strategic challenges that the Indian military faces and how far behind China it has fallen. India still relies on Russia for more than 60 percent of its defense equipment needs, and its army, air force and navy have vital Russian equipment that is often decades old and of increasingly poor quality.
The Sindhurakshak is one of 10 Russian-made Kilo-class submarines that India has as part of its front-line maritime defenses, but only six of India's submarines are operational at any given time -- far fewer than are needed to protect the nation's vast coastline.
Indeed, India has fewer than 100 ships, compared with China's 260. India is the world's largest weapons importer, but with its economy under stress and foreign currency reserves increasingly precious, that level of purchases will be increasingly hard to sustain.
The country's efforts to build its own weapons have largely been disastrous, and a growing number of corruption scandals have tainted its foreign purchases, including a recent deal to buy helicopters from Italy.
Unable to build or buy, India is becoming dangerously short of vital defense equipment, analysts say.
Meanwhile, the country's bitter rivalry with Pakistan continues. Many analysts say that India is unlikely to achieve prominence on the world stage until it reaches some sort of resolution with Pakistan of disputes that have lasted for decades over Kashmir and other issues.

Abstract: Mr. Lindstrom, who is a financial adviser at UBS Wealth Management in Omaha, and Mr. Ade, a member of the investment club Tiger 21, are among investors who say they believe farmland could be headed for a serious drop in values, if not a full-on crash. Brian C. Duke, vice president for Northern Trust, said that even with the run-up in prices for commodities, the annual return of farmland remains about 3 percent. Since 2000, the value of land in Illinois, for example, has increased 207 percent.

Full text:   DAN LINDSTROM remembers looking at a piece of Nebraska farmland six or seven years ago that cost $3,300 an acre. Raised on a farm, he ran the numbers with his brother who is farming the family land and concluded that it was too expensive. He figured that with a 2 to 3 percent return, it made more sense to put the money into a dividend-paying stock and have his brother lease additional land.
A few weeks ago, Mr. Lindstrom said similar land sold for nearly $11,000 an acre.
This is a common story across the farm belt. In Indiana, William C. Ade, who made a fortune in oil and gas exploration in Asia, said he stopped adding to his 1,000 acres when the price passed $5,000 an acre.
"Right now it's at auction as high as $12,000 an acre," he said of land to grow corn and soybeans in northwest Indiana. "A poor plot of land went for $8,000."
Mr. Lindstrom, who is a financial adviser at UBS Wealth Management in Omaha, and Mr. Ade, a member of the investment club Tiger 21, are among investors who say they believe farmland could be headed for a serious drop in values, if not a full-on crash. Of course, many of them have been thinking that for years.
The traditional view of farmland, from the farmer to the agricultural economist to the investment adviser, is, as Mr. Ade put it, "an inflation-proof bond." ("No one is going to steal it," he said. "No one is going to default on it. If inflation goes up, it will still be there.")
After the financial collapse of 2008, most forms of real estate were shunned. But not farmland. Prices shot up, driven by rising commodity prices from global demand, low interest rates in the United States and high auction prices begetting higher prices.
Now commodity prices have fallen. Corn has gone to about $4.60 a bushel this week from over $8 a bushel last year. Soybeans have fallen to about $12.60 a bushel from over $17. Yet the value of farmland for row crops has continued to rise.
"We're kind of at an inflection point," said Brent Gloy, a professor of agricultural economics at Purdue University. "We've had five years of spectacular profitability that was somewhat unanticipated. The U.S.D.A. was forecasting much lower than this, so it surprised people."
Yet there are still reasons to think that there will be buyers for land who will hold on to it for decades to come. A report released by U.S. Trust highlighted the graying of America's farmers and their need to sell or lease their land as they age.
"Can land go up and down?" asked John Taylor, national farm and ranch executive for U.S. Trust, which manages 900 farms for investors. "Sure. But I've never seen land go to zero. And with world demand, there is no vacancy factor on good U.S. farmland."
All of this raises the issue of whether it is time to sell.
Brian C. Duke, vice president for Northern Trust, said that even with the run-up in prices for commodities, the annual return of farmland remains about 3 percent. Since 2000, the value of land in Illinois, for example, has increased 207 percent. For an investment comparison, The Dow Jones industrial average went up 42 percent in that period. Triple-digit appreciation has a way of luring new investors.
More experienced investors said that appreciation isn't the goal: to realize it you have to sell the land. "The capital gain is nice, " said Albert Kirchner, who is known as Bud and owned a manufacturing company. "We don't look at the capital gain. We look at it from a productivity standpoint."
Mr. Kirchner owns 6,000 acres of corn and soybean land in Illinois, an 8,000-acre cattle ranch in Montana and 1,200 acres of timberland in Florida. But his benchmark since he started investing in land after World War II has remained a 4 percent annual return.
At that number and using Agriculture Department estimates that the average farmland value in Illinois is $7,800, Mr. Kirchner's land would be worth $46.8 million, with an annual return of $1,872,000.
But for the person who has bought land recently at auction, getting even 4 percent becomes more challenging. At $12,000 an acre, a 4 percent return is $480. Kevin Casner, who farms 2,400 acres in Carrollton, Mo., with his son Adam, said the rents in his area ranged from $150 to $450 an acre. (Those rents were negotiated before commodity prices started to fall, and will presumably drop.)
A landlord can squeeze a farmer only so far on rent. Mr. Lindstrom said that an acre of his family farm was producing 175 bushels of corn, which equals a little more than $740 at $4.25 a bushel. But a farmer has some pretty hefty fixed costs. He said that, per acre, seed is $100, nitrogen is $100, dry fertilizer is $100, taxes are $50, insecticide is $30, chemicals are $50, and cash rent is $300 on average. That is $680 without factoring in the cost of equipment and labor. There is no room to increase the rent in this example by $180 more an acre.
This balance between commodity prices and land values and rents can change. It is why all land investors need to have a long enough time frame. "If you're wanting to park money for five years, farmland is really not what you should be investing in," Mr. Duke said. "You need to have that longer-term approach."
Many farmers and investors fear the past decade could be too much of a good thing.
"In real terms the gain we've seen in farmland values over the last 10 years are greater than those we saw in the 1970s," said Professor Gloy of Purdue. In the early 1980s, farmland prices crashed when interest rates went up and farmers could not continue to borrow to finance their operations.
The two things that could set off a decline are a further drop in commodity prices and higher interest rates.
Matt Ward, one of the owners of Premier Grain Farms in Walker, Iowa, said that a drop of $2 a bushel in the price of corn translated to a loss of about $400 an acre. If all 15,000 acres he farms were planted evenly, that would translate into $6 million less in revenue than the land produced last year.
Investors who have sharecropping agreements that designate a split in the harvest between farmer and owner will see their return reduced immediately. Those who have cash leases are likely to have to negotiate lower rents when the lease is renewed.
Another option for an investor has been a variable cash lease. The owner would accept a lower cash rent up front and negotiate an additional payment if the price of the commodity or the yield was higher. There is now less chance of upside potential.
As for interest rates, the fear is that they will rise and the value of land will fall. Mr. Lindstrom, the farm owner who works for UBS, said there was no way to finance land at today's rates of 5 percent and make money. Cash buyers, he said, are at risk of losing their principal.
"Could the land go from $10,000 to $15,000 an acre?" he said. "Sure, but not today and not with corn at $4.25. I'd be surprised if we don't go from $10,000 to $8,000 or $7,000. Land has tripled in the last five to six years."
Still, this was the man who passed on buying land at $3,300 an acre because he thought it was overpriced. "We just tried to buy more ground and were willing to go to $7,500 an acre," Mr. Lindstrom said.
"It went for $10,500. My instincts tell me we'll buy that ground, and we'll buy it cheaper."

Full text:   SHENMU, China -- As the Chinese economy boomed, few cities soared faster or higher than Shenmu, a community of nearly 500,000 in northwestern China.
Top luxury clothing stores in this city's downtown were recording as much as $500,000 a day in sales. Tables at the best restaurants had to be reserved weeks in advance. The new Fortune Garden Club for the city's business elite made headlines by paying $1 million for a king-size mahogany bed, to be used by members and their companions.
But a painful credit crisis is now spreading across Shenmu and cities nearby, as thousands of businesses have closed, fleets of BMWs and Audis have been repossessed and street protests have erupted.
Now the leading purveyors of Western fashions are deserted, monthly sales at restaurants are down as much as 97 percent and the marble entrance to the Fortune Garden Club is shuttered. All but one of the city's car dealerships have failed.
The owner of the city's largest jewelry store was detained by the authorities a week ago after creditors found him secretly packing millions of dollars' worth of gold and jewels into cases and accused him of preparing to flee the city without settling his debts. A top restaurant closed a day earlier, and its owner left town, as have the founder of the Fortune Garden and many other executives.
"It's an economic crisis just like the United States has had; just like it," said Wang Ting, an operator of an illegal casino in Fugu, near Shenmu. "There's no cash, everyone stays home without a job, there's no way the economy can recover."
Shenmu, and nearby cities like Ordos and Fugu, are at the leading edge of broader troubles that are beginning to afflict the entire Chinese economy. Across China, growth has slowed. With the slowdown have come rising defaults on loans made outside the conventional banking system, chronic overcapacity in many industries like coal mining and steel production and, in particularly troubled cities like Shenmu, a sharp decline in previously debt-fueled prices for real estate and other assets.
The cracks are showing in many sizable cities like coastal Wenzhou, where informal lending, a big part of so-called shadow banking, has dominated for a quarter-century. Cities with economies linked to commodities with falling prices have also been affected, as more people have defaulted on loans. The biggest, most economically diverse metropolitan areas like Beijing and Shanghai seem considerably less affected, but also have many small and medium-size businesses that depend on informal lending.
Lending has collapsed here in northern Shaanxi Province, where it was particularly speculative and frenzied, and where the local coal industry has also been crippled by steeply falling prices.
As some borrowers began defaulting early this year, worried lenders in the informal sector raised interest rates for small and medium-size businesses, previously 25 to 40 percent a year, to as much as 125 percent a year. The increase set off a much broader wave of defaults in recent weeks, as owners found themselves unable to repay billions of dollars in bad debts, many of them handwritten and hard to enforce in court.
"Almost no one will give you a loan," said a construction executive who gave only his surname, Xie, as he stood next to his white Toyota Land Cruiser outside a project that had been halted.
Although changes are being slowly introduced, state-owned banks have long been allowed to lend only at low, regulated rates barely above the inflation rate, with the total value of loans controlled by quarterly quotas. All over China, these loans go overwhelmingly to large state-owned businesses, government officials and politically connected individuals, who then relend the money at much higher interest rates to small and medium-size businesses in the private sector that need money to grow.
Liu Linfei, a government official from nearby Yulin, stood on a Shenmu street corner in a T-shirt and shorts on a recent weekend afternoon, outside two high-rise hotels where construction had been stopped just before the windows could be installed. He said he had borrowed 600,000 renminbi, almost $100,000, from a bank shortly before the collapse, at an interest rate of 4.1 percent a year.
Mr. Liu then lent the cash to moneylenders here at an interest rate of 10.4 percent, planning to pocket the difference.
The moneylenders who borrowed from Mr. Liu defaulted, and now he is struggling to repay the bank. "I'm not going to lose my house, because I'm repaying it little by little with money I borrow from my relatives," he said.
The Chinese are finding it harder to repay loans because the economy is slowing. Most analyses of China's economy look only at the real economic growth rate, around 7.5 percent this year. But for companies' sales and profits, which determine their ability to repay debts, what really matters is the nominal growth rate, which is real economic growth plus inflation.
Private sector businesses could afford to borrow at double-digit interest rates because nominal growth of 16 to 23 percent a year from 2004 through 2011 exceeded the rates. But nominal growth slowed last year to 9.8 percent and fell again in the first half of this year, to an annual pace of 8.8 percent.
At the same time, overinvestment led to overcapacity. Dozens of new mines opened around Shenmu in the last decade and older mines expanded. But demand has grown much more slowly than expected for electricity and steel, the two main users of coal.
Coal prices have dropped by half in the last three years as a result. Now, out of 90 mines near Shenmu, practically the only ones still operating are nine that are state-owned and do not need to show a profit.
The popping of the real estate bubble has been the most serious blow to the local economy. Real estate prices had soared in cities across China. In Shenmu, 1,200-square-foot apartments that sold for less than $20,000 a decade ago reached $330,000 by last winter.
Local real estate brokers say that they are advising sellers to avoid price cuts of more than 10 percent. But local business owners who buy and sell apartments say that deals are now being done for as little as $115,000 for a 1,200-square-foot apartment, a decline of 65 percent.
Public discontent is fueling street protests. Several thousand residents turned out in mid-July for a demonstration in the expensively paved square across the street from city hall, demanding that municipal officials revive the stalled economy. More recently, a smaller group of migrant workers protested, demanding that the local government pay their back wages after construction was halted on a row of high-rise apartment buildings.
Yet a Shenmu merchant, who insisted on anonymity because of local tensions, said that he had a lot of sympathy for officials, who even put up banners on city streets last year warning residents of the dangers of participating in informal lending schemes.
"It's a national problem, it's not a local issue," he said.

Full text:   A day after the Justice Department filed a lawsuit to block the merger of American Airlines and US Airways, regulators and industry officials continued to wrestle with a central question: What is the best way to protect consumers?
To the Justice Department, a merger between American and US Airways would increase the fares and fees that have been steadily rising.
But to the airlines, the merger would lower costs and provide more flexibility for many travelers. What is more, some industry analysts said that a hobbled American, which is still trying to emerge from bankruptcy protection, would struggle to compete against the two giants, United Airlines and Delta Air Lines.
"What we are saying today is simply that they got this one wrong," Richard Parker, a lawyer for US Airways, told reporters on Wednesday.
The Justice Department's action comes after a decade of rapid consolidation in the airline industry, including the mergers of Delta and Northwest in 2008 and United and Continental in 2010. But antitrust officials said on Tuesday that despite the cost savings for the carriers from consolidation, domestic airfares, on average, had increased much faster than inflation over the last several years, prompting the department to revise its thinking about what was best for the consumer.
The Transportation Department has calculated that after adjusting for inflation, the average domestic airfare climbed to $379 in the first quarter of 2013 from $335 during the recession in 2009. And the fares varied greatly, often depending on the level of competition. For example, passengers in Huntsville, Ala., paid the highest fare, $543, in the first quarter while Atlantic City had the lowest, $169.
"I think the economics of the Justice Department is correct," said George Hoffer, a transportation economics professor at the University of Richmond. "However, they are a day late and a dollar short. This should have been their decision in the Delta-Northwest case."
But Mr. Hoffer said the airlines could prevail in court because the earlier mergers created "a structural disequilibrium" in the industry, with United and Delta having more flexibility to reroute passengers, especially lucrative corporate customers, when trouble arises.
Another issue is American's ability to compete as a stand-alone airline. The Justice Department's Antitrust Division argued that American could come out of bankruptcy as a strong competitor without the merger. It pointed to American's order of 460 new airplanes over the next decade, worth $38 billion and billed as the largest single order in history, as well as its recent return to profitability.
But some financial and aviation analysts see it differently. American's domestic network and hubs are considered weaker than Delta's or United's, and its international network is smaller. The airline is also part of Oneworld, the smallest of the three global airline alliances. American, which is owned by A.M.R., cut its costs through bankruptcy, but it did little to bridge the gap in revenues with its peers, which can command higher fares and attract more business travelers.
"Apparently, the Justice Department takes the position not held by most analysts, who viewed A.M.R.'s proposed stand-alone plan as unlikely to be competitive or to succeed," said Robert W. Mann, an aviation consultant.
If the merger is blocked, the clear winners will be United and Delta, which have global ambitions, some analysts say. A smaller American will struggle to attract business travelers with its smaller domestic network and smaller international footprint.
John Godyn, an airline analyst at Morgan Stanley Research, wrote in a note to investors that Delta and United "would have a duopoly on corporate travel, superior networks and more valuable frequent flier programs."
Professor Hoffer, however, said that American had done enough cost-cutting in recent years to hold on to its spot as the nation's fourth-largest carrier. "Because the industry is more concentrated, it would be easier for American to raise capital and grow itself," he said.
If US Airways and American prevail and the merger goes forward, they will most likely have to make significant concessions to the Justice Department -- perhaps agree to carve out some routes, sell landing rights at Washington's Reagan National Airport, or keep a low-fare program for a period of time. Antitrust officials and the airlines' lawyers suggested they were not interested in a deal, though they would have ample opportunity to talk as they moved toward a trial, possibly by the end of the year.
Southwest, which merged with AirTran in 2011, is the nation's third-largest airline. The combination of American and US Airways, the fifth-largest airline, would create the world's largest.
One crucial factor in analyzing the deal is US Airways' current role as a something of a spoiler. Because it operates out of smaller hubs than its competitors, it often offers sharply lower fares for last-minute passengers willing to make a connection rather than fly nonstop.
The Justice Department argues that the merger with American would prompt US Airways to shift more travelers to higher-priced flights at American's larger hubs. But the airlines argue that if the merger goes through, they would offer more flights each day at many airports and could negotiate better for business from big corporations that now favor United and Delta.
The combination of American and US Airways had gained the backing of American's creditors, a federal bankruptcy judge, and the unions representing the airline's pilots, flight attendants and mechanics.
Ironically, the Justice Department has endorsed the strategy initially championed by American's own executives, when they filed for court protection in November 2011. American's chairman, Tom Horton, said at the time that American would emerge as a stronger independent airline. The expectation after that was that Mr. Horton would pursue an acquisition on his own terms, most probably with US Airways.
That provided an opening for Doug Parker, the chief executive of US Airways. By advocating for a quick merger of the carriers, while American was still in bankruptcy, he managed to outmaneuver Mr. Horton, with the support of American's three labor groups.

Full text:   BERKELEY, Calif. -- CONGRESS began its summer recess last week and won't reconvene until after Labor Day. You'd be forgiven for not noticing a difference. With just 15 bills signed into law so far this year, the 113th Congress is on pace to be the most unproductive since at least the 1940s.
But just because the legislature has ceased to function doesn't mean our government has. Political decision making has moved to peripheral public entities, where power is exercised less transparently and accountability to voters is less direct. What we're losing in the process isn't government -- it's democracy.
Take the Federal Reserve. Absent any Congressional legislation to speak of -- no short-term spending to increase job growth, no long-term plan to reduce the budget deficit -- the nation's central bank has been forced to do all the heavy lifting with the economy. The $85 billion of bonds it buys each month is now the main form of government stimulus to the economy as well as the linchpin of continued job growth. Congress's inability to pass effective fiscal policy means that the Fed's monetary policy, to keep long-term interest rates as low as possible, has become the only game in town for boosting private spending and investment.
But the strategy also poses serious risks, like asset bubbles, if borrowers use the cheap money to speculate; bond collapses, if the Fed slows its bond buying too quickly and spooks the market; and inflation, if low interest rates cause buyers and sellers to expect prices to rise. It could also increase income inequality, by giving wealthy investors a cheap source of funds to expand their portfolios. Forcing the Fed to become the sole decision maker on the economy is also why the selection of a new Fed chairman has become so important -- even more important than it ought to be.
Congress's paralysis has also encouraged the Supreme Court to enter the political fray. Normally the judicial activism of recent years could be checked by Congressional action. But not now. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy's opinion for the majority in the 2010 Citizens United case, which struck down limits on corporate campaign contributions, rested partly on the presumption that Congress would require corporations to disclose their political expenditures. But no bill requiring full disclosure has stood a chance of making it through the quagmire.
The court's decision this summer in Shelby County v. Holder handed Congress the task of coming up with a new, updated formula for deciding which states and localities need permission from the Justice Department, under the Voting Rights Act, to make changes to their election processes. But legislative paralysis makes the passage of any new formula highly unlikely. Seen in this light, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr.'s deciding vote last year to uphold the Affordable Care Act probably reflected his reasonable fear that the court would otherwise be viewed, not unfairly, as just another political battleground.
Or consider climate change. It's a public debate the nation briefly embarked on in the 2008 presidential race, when John McCain and Barack Obama presented different plans for cap-and-trade systems. Naturally, gridlock in Congress put an end to it. After the election, Mr. McCain backed off any cap-and-trade plan, and the two parties have been at loggerheads over the environment ever since.
The issue ultimately lost the spotlight to a debate over Mr. Obama's choice for administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, Gina McCarthy, who is expected to use the E.P.A.'s authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate the carbon emissions of power plants; and to a Congressional showdown, motivated in part by Mr. Obama's E.P.A. appointment, over the use of the filibuster on presidential nominees.
Mr. Obama won the skirmish and got his administrator, but don't expect much public deliberation over carbon emissions from here on. The E.P.A. will handle the issue through regulatory rule making, mostly unchecked by Congress and the public.
A final displacement of national politics has been onto state governments, now grappling with everything from undocumented immigrants and gun control to gay marriage and abortion. While many political matters should be left to the states, these cry out for federal standards because of the relative ease with which undocumented immigrants, gun sellers, gay couples and women seeking abortions can transport themselves to more accommodating jurisdictions.
What's more, these institutions aren't even understood by the public to be making political decisions with national implications. Media coverage tends to be narrowly drawn for insiders -- macroeconomists, constitutional scholars, E.P.A. watchers, the residents of a particular state -- or trivialized for outsiders: Should the next Fed chief be female? Are Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas too openly partisan? Is Ms. McCarthy too much of a firebrand? Are "red" states diverging from "blue" states?
The Republican right -- mostly new House members who are supported by the Tea Party and who are in open rebellion against the rest of the right -- are probably pleased with the gridlock in Congress. They would like nothing better than to stop the federal government from functioning. But they may not fully grasp that their efforts have only shifted power elsewhere in the system.
Some of the institutions gaining power may be making decisions consistent with conservative values: the Supreme Court and some state governments, for instance. But hardly all (the Fed and the E.P.A.).
In any event, it's bizarre that a self-styled populist insurrection would end up making our government less accountable to the people. But that's exactly what it's done. What's really gridlocked now is democracy.

Full text:   Can the American airline industry turn a profit in a competitive market?
This question is probably not front-of-mind at the headquarters of American Airlines, where executives are justifiably upset that the Justice Department decided on Tuesday to oppose its merger with US Airways.
After all, antitrust regulators allowed Delta to swallow Northwest just five years ago. They let Continental merge with United in 2010.
How could the Obama administration stop American -- the last of the airlines to file for bankruptcy as a means to wipe out debt and lower labor costs, the one that tried hardest to stay in the game by going it alone -- from doing the same thing?
But whether American and the other three so-called legacy carrier airlines that remain in operation can, in fact, learn to survive in a competitive market and make money without turning routes and networks into virtual monopolies, is the right question to ask.
Airline executives, it must be clear by now, seem to believe pretty strongly that they cannot. This is not only apparent in their penchant for mergers, which has led to capacity reductions and fare increases. Their preferred strategies over the years -- bulking up into closed allied networks, keeping customers via frequent flier systems and corporate loyalty programs -- all share a basic mistrust of open competition.
But they will have to learn fast. On Tuesday, the Justice Department sought to eliminate further oligopolization -- the control of the industry by a small number of dominant players -- from the airlines' strategic tool kit. Airlines in the United States need an alternative path.
The airlines' track record is dismal. From 1979 -- right after the deregulation of the industry -- through 2009, airlines lost $59 billion on their domestic operations (in 2009 dollars), according to Severin Borenstein from the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley, and $8 billion on international flights. Since the 1990s, US Airways, United, Northwest, Delta, Continental and American Airlines have all filed for bankruptcy -- a couple of them twice.
To some extent, it's not their fault. Airlines racked up most of their losses in the 2000s, when rising fuel costs and the drop in passengers following the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, walloped their bottom line. The entry of low-cost carriers like JetBlue and Southwest, which had taken some 25 percent of the domestic market by the middle of the decade, also eroded profitability of the legacy carriers.
Still, Professor Borenstein points out: "I don't think the fact that they've been losing money is justification for mergers. The reason they are losing money is they have much higher costs than smaller airlines."
Eliminating competition has been their main strategic response. Delta has been making money recently: almost $2.5 billion in the last three years. United made almost $400 million over the period, even after losing more than $700 million last year because of problems in merging its systems with Continental's. US Airways made about $1.2 billion. Even American, in bankruptcy since 2011, managed to turn a profit in the second quarter of this year.
A big reason for the turnaround is that oligopolies work. Fares rose by 16 percent on top of inflation over the last three years, after falling fairly consistently through the previous decade. And airlines introduced a tattoo of additional charges, for services like making a reservation or taking a suitcase that used to be included in the price of a ticket.
In its complaint against the merger, the Justice Department quoted US Airways president, Scott Kirby, who noted that consolidation has "allowed the industry to do things like ancillary revenues," which he called "a structural permanent change to the industry and one that's impossible to overstate the benefit of it." Indeed, in 2012 domestic airlines chalked up $6 billion in fees from checked bags and flight changes alone.
For the Justice Department, whether it is unfair to prohibit American Airlines and US Airways from doing what it allowed Delta, United and friends to do before -- rightly or wrongly -- is beside the point. The officials' objective is to maintain some modicum of competition in the airline industry and -- perhaps -- promote even more.
"The airline industry is not the most competitive industry in the history of mankind," Bill Baer, assistant attorney general in charge of the department's antitrust division, told me on Tuesday. "This oligopolistic structure is working in ways that don't really benefit consumers."
This merger is special in two ways. First, the American deal with US Airways is particularly anticompetitive. The airlines share many routes and airports, so a merger would take out two rivals who are proving strong competitors. American, its books cleansed by bankruptcy, has an aggressive stand-alone plan to compete by buying new jets and opening new routes. US Air has proved to be a feisty low-fare competitor, saving passengers hundreds of millions of dollars, the D.O.J. says.
The other peculiarity, unfortunately perhaps for American and US Airways, is that this merger comes after the previous two. If Justice were to allow this to go through, only four airlines, including Southwest, would control 80 percent of the domestic air travel market.
Nothing has been decided yet. American and US Air said in a statement that they would fight the Justice Department in court. Yet, for the sake of passengers and even the industry itself, there is a good case for them trying to go it alone. They might actually make it.
There are profitable and competitive models for the industry to follow. The low-cost airlines are mostly profitable. And the lumbering legacy carriers are less lumbering than they used to be. They have shed costs, often at the expense of their own employees and retirees. They have gotten better at investing in the proper equipment and at hedging fuel prices. And they have shed much of the excess capacity that plagued them through much of the last decade.
This might cut against airline executives' instincts, focused as they have been on culling competition over more than 20 years. But perhaps competition won't kill them. They might even thrive.

Full text:   UNLESS you know they're taking place, amazing feats of endurance and longevity are invisible in their early stages.
Few people paid much attention when a rookie named Lou Gehrig entered a Yankee game against the Washington Senators on June 1, 1925, and why would they? He was a pinch-hitter, and he didn't get on base. But he played the next day, and the next, and kept going for 2,130 consecutive games until nearly everybody noticed. After Gehrig's 2,000th game in 1938, this newspaper celebrated his achievement as "a record which probably never will be surpassed."
Records are made to be broken, of course. Cal Ripken Jr. shattered that one with an extraordinary attendance record of 2,632 consecutive games that started under everybody's radar on May 30, 1982. It ended with enormous hoopla more than 16 years later, and Ripken received credit for reviving baseball's popularity when fans deserted after the strike-shortened 1994 season.
Why bring up these stretches of workaday achievement now? It's not just that baseball, mired in another dreary steroid scandal this summer, could dearly use another quiet hero.
As I noted in a column at the beginning of the year, making money is, arguably, the true national pastime of the United States. And for people who track the ups and downs of the financial markets, it may be time to take notice that another epic streak is well under way: the stock market rose at the opening bell of 2012, and it has never dropped below that level.
As streaks often do, this one started quietly enough. It began more than 19 months ago, on Jan. 3, 2012, the first trading day of the year. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index galloped out of the gate, immediately putting it into positive territory. While the market had many declines -- including a deep sag after President Obama's re-election in November -- the overall trend line was positive. In 2012, the stock market never fell below 1,258.86, its opening level for the year.
That seemed unusual enough when Paul Hickey, co-founder of the Bespoke Investment Group, alerted me about it at the end of last year, during what seemed to be a rocky period for the market. What's remarkable is that despite uneven and often lackluster economic reports, and amid continuing worries on Wall Street about the Federal Reserve's plans to taper its loose monetary policy, the stock market's long upward streak continues.
For the current calendar year, too, the S.& P. 500 has never closed below its January opening level. So the streak is now running strongly into its second year. How unusual is that? I asked Mr. Hickey to crunch the numbers. He's found that this is already the second-longest streak since 1928, when his records begin.
The longest lasted exactly two years. It started on the opening day of trading in 1975, extended through all of 1976, and ended on Jan. 3, 1977, the first trading day of that year, when the market fell. While the market had big gains in that period, that streak received little if any attention at the time.
The current streak has also received little fanfare. Neither, really, has the entire bull market in stocks.
"In some ways, it's the most detested bull market of all time," said Michael Hartnett, chief global equity strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. "A big part of that comes from what preceded this market: the bursting of two large equity bubbles within a 10-year period, and the terrible trauma that caused."
While there have been net inflows into stocks lately, many private clients and big institutional investors have never become comfortable with the current equity market, he said. The persistently weak economy has also dampened investors' enthusiasm.
"You hear more about the revival of the housing market these days than you do about the boom in the stock market," he said.
And yet the market has been extraordinarily strong, in a very understated way. There have been few big days in the market this year, for example, Mr. Hickey says. Big-volume days have tended to occur on down days, not when the market is rallying.
Only 10 percent of trading days in recent weeks have had gains of at least 1 percent, compared with more than 16 percent of such days since 1998, his data shows.
"There just haven't been a lot of big days that have captured headlines," he said.
For many market bulls, that lack of visibility is auspicious.
"I'm not seeing many signs of excess," said Laszlo Birinyi, president of Birinyi Associates, the stock market research firm in Westport, Conn. "We have not reached the exuberant phase of the market cycle."
In 2009, Mr. Birinyi was among the earliest strategists to declare that a new bull market had begun. While he says that after the big gains of recent months, it's quite possible that the market will move sideways or even decline for a time, he also says it's likely that the overall upward trend will continue.
Similarly, Richard Bernstein, formerly the chief investment strategist at Merrill Lynch and now the proprietor of his own firm and a fund manager for Eaton Vance, said, "We're in the middle of one of the greatest bull markets of our careers, and practically no one recognizes it."
People have been nervous about the economy, Mr. Bernstein said, "but it's important to remember that the stock market sets prices off corporate profits, not G.D.P., and profits have been strong."
In addition, he said, "economists and politicians like to talk about absolutes of good or bad, but what the market cares about is better or worse, and the economy's gotten better."
Still, the economy is troubled and the market's performance is not yet all that impressive by at least one very important measure. Adjust for inflation, and even after all of its advances since 2009, the market still isn't at a record high.
The highest that the S.& P. 500 has climbed in this cycle is 1,709.67, which it reached on Aug. 2. Taking inflation into account, Mr. Hickey says, the market's record peak occurred on March 24, 2000, when it hit roughly 2,093 in today's dollars. And on Oct. 9, 2007, it reached roughly 1,748, inflation-adjusted.
This long slog back toward the level of more than a decade ago has disillusioned many people.
"We're not seeing a lot of excitement about the market," Mr. Hickey said. So even if stocks keep grinding upward, it may be awhile before there's much excitement about the market streak.

Full text:   TOKYO -- The Bank of Japan on Thursday left its vast monetary easing program unchanged as it issued an upbeat assessment of Tokyo's efforts to counter growth-sapping deflation.
In a widely expected move, the central bank said its board voted unanimously to stand pat after a two-day policy meeting, as investors keep a close eye on the Federal Reserve of the United States amid growing speculation that it will soon start tapering its large stimulus program.
The Bank of Japan, which unveiled its own gigantic bond-buying program in April, said the outlook for the country -- the world's third-biggest economy -- was looking brighter, while early signs of rising prices were good news for its efforts to hit a 2 percent inflation target within two years.
Many analysts have expressed doubts on the Bank of Japan's ambitious timeline, given that the country has been struggling with deflation for more than 15 years. The inflation target is a crucial part of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's plan, known as Abenomics.
"Japan's economy is starting to recover moderately," the Bank of Japan said on Thursday, pointing to better times ahead for important export markets. "Overseas economies as a whole are gradually heading toward a pickup, although a lackluster performance is partly seen."

To the Editor:
Re "For Medical Tourists, Simple Math" ("Paying Till It Hurts" series, front page, Aug. 4), about the prices charged by medical device manufacturers, focusing on artificial hips and knees:
Contrary to the article's claims, the medical technology industry is highly price competitive. Over the last 20 years, industry prices have increased at only one-fifth the rate of prices for other medical goods and services and only about one-third as fast as the Consumer Price Index. Implants like artificial hips and knees are, if anything, even more competitively priced. Medical technology has consistently accounted for a low and stable 6 percent share of national health expenditures.
While prices have actually declined in inflation-adjusted terms, the industry has continued to develop scores of lifesaving and life-enhancing products. Decades of technological advances allow the patient profiled, who could not even stand without pain before surgery, to resume snowboarding.
Low prices and amazing medical progress. That's a good deal for American patients.
STEPHEN J. UBL President, Advanced Medical Technology Association Washington, Aug. 6, 2013
To the Editor:
Your useful account of the much higher prices for hip replacements in the United States compared with Europe only scratches the surface of the problem. At the heart of this situation is the effective elimination of the competition that international transactions in medical services can provide.
"Exporting patients and importing doctors" is an important way in which we can introduce competition to bring down the exorbitant cost of many surgeries beyond hip replacement. "Long-distance" consultations and treatment (telemedicine) are also effective ways to introduce competition and greatly reduce costs.
Equally, relaxing entry by foreign medical personnel will reduce the danger that we will insure people who will be unable to find doctors to treat them.
JAGDISH BHAGWATI SANDIP MADAN New York, Aug. 6, 2013
The writers are, respectively, a professor of economics at Columbia and the chief executive of Global HealthNet.
To the Editor:
Orthopedic surgeons applaud your article's emphasis on joint replacement as a transformative experience. This was demonstrated by the patients profiled, who are back to work, living their active lives.
The article's inclusion of the surgeon's fee for one patient's operation (shown in a graphic) was, however, misleading. The average Medicare reimbursement for an orthopedic surgeon is $1,454 for a total hip replacement, a far cry from the $17,500 for the operation cited in the graphic. Average Medicare reimbursement to a hospital (including the implant) is, as you point out in your article, approximately $12,000, again a far cry from the $44,900 in the graphic.

Full text:   The fast-food workers who have been walking off their jobs illustrate a central fact of contemporary work life in America: As lower-wage occupations have proliferated in the past several years, Americans are increasingly unable to make a living at their jobs. They work harder and are paid less than workers in other advanced countries. And their wages have stagnated even as executive pay has soared.
As measured by the federal minimum wage, currently $7.25 an hour, low-paid work in America is lower paid today than at any time in modern memory. If the minimum wage had kept pace with inflation or average wages over the past nearly 50 years, it would be about $10 an hour; if it had kept pace with the growth in average labor productivity, it would be about $17 an hour.
In contrast, the median hourly pay of fast-food workers -- most of whom are in their 20s or older and many of whom are parents -- is less than $9 for front-line workers and just above $9 when shift supervisors are included. Not surprising, the strikers demanded better pay -- $15 an hour -- and the right to organize without retaliation.
Also not surprising, they have been motivated to act by the inaction of the nation's leaders. Republicans are against a higher minimum wage, and Democrats are too timid. Legislation proposed by Congressional Democrats would raise the hourly minimum to $10.10 over nearly two-and-a-half years from the date of enactment. President Obama has proposed a similarly gradual increase to $9 an hour. Congress and the White House also squandered a chance to try to improve workers' earnings prospects when they let right-to-organize legislation die years ago.
Activism among fast-food workers is almost certain to continue and is likely to spread to other underpaid workers. Most of the jobs lost during the recession were midwage jobs, while most of the new jobs have been lower paying. In addition to food-service jobs, big growth areas today include home care and retail sales, with median hourly wages of roughly $10 and $11, respectively. According to the Labor Department, six of the 10 occupations that are projected to add the most jobs by 2020 pay wages at the lower end of the scale.
At some point, as strikes continue, well-paid executives in low-wage industries will have to confront the fact that low worker pay is at odds with their companies' upbeat corporate images and their self-images as top executives. (The chief executives of McDonald's and Yum Brands, which owns Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and KFC, are among the nation's highest-paid corporate leaders.)
Political leaders will likewise have to confront their own failures. The strikers did not ask for Washington's help, but there is a lot that Congress and the Obama administration could do. In addition to raising the minimum wage, there needs to be more enforcement of fair labor laws, including crackdowns on employers that misclassify employees as salaried workers, independent contractors or interns in order to deny them overtime, benefits or other pay. It would help, too, for Congress to end the foot-dragging around implementation of a law passed years ago requiring disclosure of the ratio of chief executive pay to that of a company's work force.
The Great Recession and the slow recovery have reinforced trends toward inequality and inadequate pay that were evident even before the last downturn. Fast-food workers are fighting back, in just cause.

Abstract: According to the Kaiser Family Foundation survey, the average contribution by public employees throughout the country is 12 percent for individual plans and 23 percent for family plans.

Full text:   Cities and towns across the country are pushing municipal unions to accept cheaper health benefits in anticipation of a component of the Affordable Care Act that will tax expensive plans starting in 2018.
The so-called Cadillac tax was inserted into the Affordable Care Act at the advice of economists who argued that expensive health insurance with the employee bearing little cost made people insensitive to the cost of care. In public employment, though, where benefits are arrived at through bargaining with powerful unions, switching to cheaper plans will not be easy.
Cities including New York and Boston, and school districts from Westchester County, N.Y., to Orange County, Calif., are warning unions that if they cannot figure out how to rein in health care costs now, the price when the tax goes into effect will be steep, threatening raises and even jobs.
"Every municipality with a generous health care plan is doing the math on this," said J. D. Piro, a health care lawyer at a human resources consultancy, Aon Hewitt.
But some prominent liberals express frustration at seeing the tax used against unions in negotiations.
"I think it was misguided all along," Robert B. Reich, the former labor secretary, said in an e-mail. When the law was being written, he said, he worried that the tax was "a blunt instrument that could too easily become a bargaining chit for cutting back benefits of workers."
"Apparently, that's what it's become," Mr. Reich, who is a professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley, said.
Under the tax, plans that cost above a certain threshold in 2018 -- $10,200 annually for individual plans and $27,500 for family plans, with slightly higher cutoffs for retirees and those in high-risk professions like law enforcement -- will be taxed at 40 percent of their costs in excess of the limit. (The thresholds will rise with inflation after 2018.)
State and local governments across the country tend to offer more expensive health plans than private businesses do, and workers often accept smaller wage increases to retain their benefits. Because of this, state and local government employees are expected to be disproportionately represented among those whose plans will be subject to the tax.
New York City expects its two most popular employee health plans to reach taxable Cadillac levels by 2018 or shortly after. This year, the city projects that it will pay a total of $7,128 for individuals and $18,249 for families in its most popular plan, including the costs the city pays into union welfare funds to cover prescription drug benefits. That is above the national average for employer-sponsored health care coverage, which last year was $5,615 for single coverage and $15,745 for family coverage, according to a 2012 Kaiser Family Foundation survey.
The total health care cost for the city's nearly 300,000 municipal employees, pre-Medicare-age retirees and their dependents is expected to approach $8 billion by 2018.
In a letter in April to the head of a labor coalition, Caswell F. Holloway IV, deputy mayor for operations, said the Cadillac tax would cost New York City $22 million in 2018, increasing to $549 million in 2022. (This year, the total city budget, excluding federal and state aid, is just over $50 billion.)
"We know that, on the current trajectory, we're going to be hit with that tax and it would increase very steeply," Mr. Holloway said.
So the administration of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, in its final months in office, is asking municipal unions to agree to seek new bids for the city's health insurance business, hoping to lower premiums. It has already achieved one small victory, getting the city's current primary insurer to freeze premiums for one year if it keeps the city's business, the mayor said on Friday.
But lower-cost plans are likely to involve greater out-of-pocket costs and more limited networks of doctors, and so far, the response from labor has been cool.
Ninety-five percent of city employees and 93 percent of retirees are in the two largest plans, which require employees to pay nothing toward their premiums. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation survey, the average contribution by public employees throughout the country is 12 percent for individual plans and 23 percent for family plans.
Harry Nespoli, the chairman of the Municipal Labor Committee, the labor coalition that negotiates with the city on health care, said that he was concerned about the tax, but also that the burden of any cuts would fall largely on workers at the bottom of the pay scale.
Mr. Nespoli said his staff was looking over the request for proposals that the city had written, but he said he was skeptical that the process of seeking new health insurance could be completed before the next administration.
"We're not going to turn around and do a $7 billion contract that affects our members for the next 10 years out without looking at it very carefully," he said.
Most of Boston's 20,000 employees are currently in plans that by 2018 would exceed the tax threshold. The city and its unions are preparing a request for proposals for new insurance coverage.
"The tax is going to be a hit, and, if you're not expecting it, it's going to be very shocking," said Meredith Weenick, the chief financial officer for Boston.
Jim Finley, the executive director of the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities, said he thought it would be hard for Connecticut towns and cities to get their unions to agree to cheaper health care benefits to avoid the tax.
"In the end, it's the taxpayer that's going to bear that burden," Mr. Finley said.
In Orange County, Calif., the Newport Mesa Unified School District warned employees during contract negotiations that if the district's health care costs continued rising at the current rate, the district could face a $2.3 million burden from the tax in 2018.
The teachers' union ultimately agreed to accept greater out-of-pocket costs to reduce the increase in its premium this year to 3 percent from 6 percent, but union leaders said they resented the district's using the threat of the tax as a negotiating tactic.
Municipal unions opposed the inclusion of the tax in the health care law, and it was partly their efforts that succeeded in delaying its effective date until 2018.
Steven Kreisberg, the director of collective bargaining and health care policy at the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, said the term Cadillac tax was misleading, because it "connotes a certain aspect of luxury in these health plans that is just factually incorrect."
The announcement last month that the Obama administration would delay by a year the mandate that larger employers offer coverage to their workers does not affect the timing of the excise tax, although it may provide encouragement to those who hope that the assessment will be delayed or scrapped altogether.
"Some skeptics, and I'm not one of them, say that that's why the tax was put into effect in 2018 -- that it's far enough away that people can consider whether or not they really want it to go into effect," Mr. Piro, the health care lawyer, said.
Jonathan Gruber, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who was a paid consultant to the Obama administration on health care policy, said forcing state and local governments to rein in health care costs was exactly what the tax was intended to do.
"This is intended to shift compensation away from excessively generous health insurance toward wages," he said.
In New York, if the Bloomberg administration does not succeed in getting new health insurance before the end of the year, the problem will fall in the lap of the next mayor.
Mr. Holloway said the Bloomberg administration, like many city governments, had long been concerned about the rising cost of health care and its impact on the budget.
But the 2018 tax "adds a sense of real urgency to getting a handle on this," he said.
"We've got to start thinking about this now," he continued. "Why is it that my plan is so expensive per person? What are the ways that we could get that under control?"

Full text:   TEHRAN -- Hassan Rouhani was sworn in as Iran's president during a ceremony in Parliament on Sunday, after which he presented a new cabinet dominated by technocrats who had previously served under a moderate former president, Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.
The cabinet must still be confirmed by Parliament.
"My government will be one of foresight and hope," Mr. Rouhani said in a speech after his swearing-in ceremony, adding that his election showed that the Iranian people want "to live free," and "are longing for change and progress, they want relief from poverty and discrimination."
He faces a mountain of problems, including rampant inflation, diminishing revenues and foreign reserves, possible food shortages and new United States sanctions over the country's nuclear program.
By choosing to stock his cabinet with old hands from the Rafsanjani years, Mr. Rouhani appeared to be looking to a more moderate past to solve current problems and plan for the future, analysts said. And he showed that the former president would wield considerable influence in the new government.
"Most key ministers have served under Hashemi-Rafsanjani," said Nader Karimi Joni, a political analyst who has been critical of Iran's leaders. "This shows his clear involvement."
Mr. Rafsanjani, 78, wanted to run for a new term as president this year, but he was barred by the country's Guardian Council, which said he was too old.
During the ceremony on Sunday, he sat smiling next to the incoming president.
Among the Rafsanjani protégés is the proposed minister of oil, Bijan Namdar Zangeneh, who is widely regarded as the modernizer of Iran's oil industry, having invited in Western companies to help carry out the work. The incoming minister of housing, Abbas Akhondi, held the same position during Mr. Rafsanjani's tenure, from 1989 to 1997.
The proposed head of the influential Ministry of Industries and Mines, Mohammad Reza Nematzadeh, is a former member of the Revolutionary Guards who is now strictly opposed to involvement by that organization in the economy.
Mr. Rouhani's choice for foreign minister, Javad Zarif, raised the most eyebrows. Mr. Zarif, 53, has lived half his life in the United States, is a fluent English speaker and served from 2002 to 2007 as Iran's ambassador to the United Nations. He was also part of Mr. Rouhani's nuclear negotiating team, which in 2003 struck a deal with European nations to temporarily suspend uranium enrichment.
"These appointments mean Mr. Rouhani's cabinet is technocrat-dominated and geared towards changing domestic and international affairs, like what we saw during Mr. Rafsanjani's time," Mr. Joni said.
Hinting that he was open to talks with the West, Mr. Rouhani emphasized that sanctions and even war would not change the minds of Iran's leaders regarding the nuclear program.
"To have interactions with Iran, there should be talks based on an equal position, building mutual trust and respect, and reducing enmity," Mr. Rouhani said. Speaking to the West, he added, "I hereby say this explicitly, that if you expect a suitable response, you should talk to Iran with respect, not the language of sanctions." His words prompted loud applause from members of Parliament and other officials.
Officials close to the new president are saying that they want to see a first-step gesture from the United States, noting that Mr. Rouhani's landslide victory has given him a broad mandate to negotiate with the West.
The White House released a statement on Sunday hailing the arrival of Mr. Rouhani, but it made no mention of concessions.
"The inauguration of President Rouhani presents an opportunity for Iran to act quickly to resolve the international community's deep concerns over Iran's nuclear program," the statement read. "Should this new government choose to engage substantively and seriously to meet its international obligations and find a peaceful solution to this issue, it will find a willing partner in the United States."

Full text:   TEHRAN -- Iran's new president, Hassan Rouhani, vowed Saturday to work with the outside world to lift the "oppressive sanctions" crippling the Iranian economy, as he received the official backing of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei at a ceremony marking the start of his presidential term.
In an acknowledgment of the growing toll that international economic restrictions connected to Iran's nuclear program are having on the population, both Mr. Rouhani and Ayatollah Khamenei made the economy a major theme of their remarks.
"People called for change and improvement in their living standards, they want to live better," Mr. Rouhani said.
But he and the ayatollah offered somewhat different solutions. Whereas Mr. Rouhani said that interactions with the world, meaning talks with Europe and potentially the United States, were a way out of the crisis, Ayatollah Khamenei, who as supreme leader has final word on all important issues, expressed pessimism that such overtures would yield fruit. "Some of our enemies do not speak with our language of wisdom," he said, urging self-sufficiency.
As Mr. Rouhani takes his public oath of office on Sunday, Iran's growing economic crisis sits atop his agenda. Sanctions have slashed oil exports and limited Iran's ability to transfer money from abroad. The shortage has been aggravated by the profligate spending that is a legacy of the departing government of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.
During most of Mr. Ahmadinejad's two four-year terms, Iran enjoyed an oil windfall, with a flow of dollars and euros that fueled huge imports on goods ranging from ice cream to Porsches.
But now Mr. Rouhani's aides describe Iran's economic situation as the worst in decades. Many blame what they call Mr. Ahmadinejad's erratic economic policies, punctuated by slashed subsidies and unbridled inflation.
The signs of woe abound.
Lacking money, Iran's national soccer team scrapped a training trip to Portugal. Teachers in Tehran nervously awaited their wages, which were inexplicably delayed by more than a week. Officials warned recently that food and medicine imports have stalled for three weeks because of a lack of foreign currency.
While Mr. Rouhani has asked for a hundred days to review the state of the economy and devise solutions, there are some voices who now say that the only way to solve the economic ills is to come up with a political settlement of Iran's nuclear dispute. Those voices were barely heard during Mr. Ahmadinejad's tenure.
"Rouhani's economic success depends on the determination of Iran's other leaders to find a solution for the nuclear support," an economics professor, Mohsen Renani of the University of Isfahan, told the Web site Neco News.
In another sign of dissatisfaction over the consequences of Iran's nuclear stance, an influential political professor publicly expressed doubt recently over the benefits of the nuclear program. "Why are we producing radioisotopes when we can import them much cheaper?" the professor, Sadegh Zibakalam of Tehran University, told the reformist weekly Aseman. "Why should we maintain a nuclear program when we have no economic justification?"
While those voices may have grown louder, they by no means represent the official position of Iran's ruling establishment, which maintains that self-sufficiency in nuclear energy is nonnegotiable.
"Whatever happens, our nuclear stances will not change nor waver," Mohammad Taghi Rahbar, a former member of Parliament and an influential Friday Prayer leader in Isfahan, said in an interview. "Our supreme leader, the nation and all officials from all factions believe this is our inalienable right, so we will not retreat at all."
But ignoring the increasing economic pressures, while promising a better future -- a strategy favored by Iran's leaders over the past years -- is proving increasingly complicated. Almost everybody in Iran is feeling the pain.
"It starts with little things, like some weeks ago there was no butter to be found," said Somaye, 31, a teacher who asked that she not be fully identified so as not to attract the attention of the authorities. "It makes you think, What's going on?"
Like those of other teachers in Tehran, the capital and economic pulse of the country, her wages came in unusually late this month, after officials had promised every day they would pay. It took 10 days for her salary to be transferred. "I got in trouble with debts I had to pay," she said.
Last week, the Portuguese coach of Iran's soccer team, Carlos Queiroz, who helped Iran qualify for the 2014 World Cup, told local news media that an important training trip to Lisbon had been canceled because officials said there was no money to pay for it. Importers are complaining that the Central Bank is not providing them with foreign currency needed to buy products abroad. "We really need all sorts of medicine, from contraception pills to products for hemophilia patients," said one influential importer who asked not to be identified because of his government contacts. "But we can't bring them in as the Central Bank is not providing us with dollars."
Less oil money is coming in because of the sanctions. Iran's largest customer, China, has not been paying for oil purchases with cash, instead bartering with goods and equipment at unfavorable prices, the news agency Tasmin reported last Sunday, quoting Amir Jafarpour, the manager of the Oil Ministry's transportation and fuel headquarters.
"Instead of getting our money we have been forced to buy 315 Chinese-made subway coaches at higher prices," he said, complaining that the Chinese were also pocketing the interest at Iranian oil bank accounts in China.
The sanctions situation could become far more onerous under legislation passed Wednesday by the United States House of Representatives, which would basically coerce Iran's remaining oil customers to find other suppliers. The legislation, which the Senate will consider next month, amounts to a threatened embargo on Iran's oil, its most important export.
Mr. Ahmadinejad defended his policies in a meeting with Ayatollah Khamenei last week, saying that Iranians had never been happier and that his government had successfully changed the way ballooning state subsidies were distributed by increasing prices of staples and giving direct cash handouts of $13 each to 60 million people each month.
But as members of Mr. Rouhani's team prepare to take over, they say they are shocked with what they are finding as they go through the books. "The economic situation is much worse from what we expected," Akbar Torkan, a member of Mr. Rouhani's inner circle, told Aseman.
Others are more outspoken. "Iran is an economical wreck," Yahya Ale Eshaq, a former trade minister and close ally of Mr. Rouhani, told Tejarat-e Farda, a business magazine, last week.
Warning that imported raw materials had dwindled, grinding local production to a halt, Mr. Ale Eshaq, who is also the head of the Tehran Chamber of Commerce, said that one of Mr. Rouhani's main challenges would be just to provide basic goods. "We will face shortages," he said.
Mr. Rouhani has criticized Mr. Ahmadinejad's economic policies, saying that almost no jobs had been created during his two terms and that millions of Iranians could face unemployment in coming years.
He also told lawmakers that inflation was rising at an annualized rate of 42 percent -- far higher than the 32 percent rate reported by the government-controlled Central Bank. Private economists say Iran's inflation rate could be even higher.
"The outgoing government for a long time enjoyed record oil revenues," said Morteza Bank, a former minister who now advises Mr. Rouhani. He said that Iran was currently exporting one million barrels of oil a day. That is less than half the 2.5 million barrels a day exported before the sanctions were imposed.
"We have to make the effort to reconstruct this economical wreck," he told the semiofficial Iranian Labour News Agency on Saturday.
Those close to Mr. Rouhani say he will do what he can to turn the economy around. He is now asking Parliament to alter the coming budget to prevent a deficit, which means his cabinet will take unpopular measures like cutting the cash payments and increasing gasoline prices.
"Unless we take measures, we will not be able to pay the cash subsidies from December onward," Gholam Reza Tajgardoun, a former vice president, warned in the reformist newspaper Shargh Daily.
Members of Mr. Rouhani's inner circle have hewed to the official line that the sanctions and economic woes will not force any nuclear concessions. "First of all we are looking for seriousness from the other side," said an associate of Mr. Rouhani's. "Unless we see tangible, serious, active reach-out, we will not be persuaded to spin around empty gestures," the associate said, asking to remain anonymous upon Mr. Rouhani's request.

Full text:   My hometown -- Port Clinton, Ohio, population 6,050 -- was in the 1950s a passable embodiment of the American dream, a place that offered decent opportunity for the children of bankers and factory workers alike.
But a half-century later, wealthy kids park BMW convertibles in the Port Clinton High School lot next to decrepit "junkers" in which homeless classmates live. The American dream has morphed into a split-screen American nightmare. And the story of this small town, and the divergent destinies of its children, turns out to be sadly representative of America.
Growing up, almost all my classmates lived with two parents in homes their parents owned and in neighborhoods where everyone knew everyone else's first name. Some dads worked in the local auto-part factories or gypsum mines, while others, like my dad, were small businessmen. In that era of strong unions and full employment, few families experienced joblessness or serious economic insecurity. Very few P.C.H.S. students came from wealthy backgrounds, and those few made every effort to hide that fact.
Half a century later, my classmates, now mostly retired, have experienced astonishing upward mobility. Nearly three-quarters of them surpassed their parents in education and in that way advanced economically as well. One-third of my classmates came from homes with parents who had not completed high school and, of that group, nearly half went to college.
Low costs at public and private colleges across Ohio were supplemented by locally raised scholarships -- from the Rotary Club, the United Automobile Workers, the Junior Women's Club and the like. Although the only two black students in my class encountered racial prejudice in town and none of their parents had finished grade school, both reached graduate school. Neither for them nor for our white classmates was family background the barrier to upward mobility that it would become in the next century.
Our (white) star quarterback, whom I will call J, grew up on the poor side of town. His dad, who had an eighth-grade education, worked two jobs to keep the family afloat -- on the line at Port Clinton Manufacturing from 7 to 3, then at the canning factory from 3:30 to 11. Despite his 70-plus-hour workweek, J's dad made it to J's games. Unable to afford a car, J's family hitched rides with neighbors to church every week and ate a lot of hash. Despite their modest background, J's parents urged him to aim for college, and he chose the college-prep track at P.C.H.S., finishing in the top quarter of our class. His minister pointed him toward a downstate Lutheran institution and made a phone call to help find him financial aid. J graduated debt-free and continued on to seminary and a successful career as a Lutheran minister, coaching high school football on the side.
J's rise from a well-knit but modest working-class family to a successful professional career was not atypical, as a recent survey of my classmates revealed. My classmates describe our youth in strikingly similar terms: "We were poor, but we didn't know it." In fact, however, in the breadth and depth of the social support we enjoyed, we were rich, but we didn't know it.
As we graduated, none of us had any inkling that Port Clinton would change anytime soon. While almost half of us headed off to college, those who stayed in town had reason to expect a steady job (if they were male), marriage and a more comfortable life than their parents'.
But just beyond the horizon a national economic, social and cultural whirlwind was gathering force that would radically transform the life chances of the children and grandchildren of the graduates of the P.C.H.S. class of 1959. The change would be jaw dropping and heart wrenching, for Port Clinton turns out to be a poster child for changes that have engulfed America.
The manufacturing foundation of Port Clinton's modest prosperity in the 1950s and 1960s began to tremble in the 1970s. The big Standard Products factory at the east end of town provided nearly 1,000 steady, good-paying blue-collar jobs in the 1950s, but the payroll was more than halved in the 1970s. After two more decades of layoffs and "give backs," the plant gates on Maple Street finally closed in 1993, leaving a barbed-wire-encircled ruin now graced with Environmental Protection Agency warnings of toxicity. But that was merely the most visible symbol of the town's economic implosion.
Manufacturing employment in Ottawa County plummeted from 55 percent of all jobs in 1965 to 25 percent in 1995 and kept falling. By 2012 the average worker in Ottawa County had not had a real raise for four decades and, in fact, is now paid roughly 16 percent less in inflation-adjusted dollars than his or her grandfather in the early 1970s. The local population fell as P.C.H.S. graduates who could escape increasingly did. Most of the downtown shops of my youth stand empty and derelict, driven out of business by gradually shrinking paychecks and the Walmart on the outskirts of town.
The social impact of those economic hammer blows was initially cushioned by the family and community bonds that had been so strong in my youth. But as successive graduating P.C.H.S. classes entered an ever worsening local economy, the social fabric of the 1950s and 1960s was gradually shredded. Juvenile-delinquency rates began to skyrocket in the 1980s and were triple the national average by 2010. Not surprisingly, given falling wages and loosening norms, single-parent households in Ottawa County doubled from 10 percent in 1970 to 20 percent in 2010, while the divorce rate more than quadrupled. In Port Clinton itself, the epicenter of the local economic collapse in the 1980s, the rate of births out of wedlock quadrupled between 1978 and 1990, topping out at about 40 percent, nearly twice the race-adjusted national average (itself rising rapidly).
Unlike working-class kids in the class of 1959, many of their counterparts in Port Clinton today are, despite toil and talent, locked into troubled, even hopeless lives. R, an 18-year-old white woman, is almost the same age as my grandchildren. Her grandfather could have been one of my classmates. But when I went off to college on a scholarship from a local employer, he skipped college in favor of a well-paid, stable blue-collar job. Then the factories closed, and good, working-class jobs fled. So while my kids, and then my grandchildren, headed off to elite colleges and successful careers, his kids never found steady jobs, were seduced by drugs and crime, and burned through a string of impermanent relationships.
His granddaughter R tells a harrowing tale of loneliness, distrust and isolation. Her parents split up when she was in preschool and her mother left her alone and hungry for days. Her dad hooked up with a woman who hit R, refused to feed her and confined R to her room with baby gates. She says her only friend was a yellow mouse who lived in her apartment. Caught trafficking drugs in high school, R spent several months in a juvenile detention center and failed out of high school, finally eking out a diploma online. Her experiences left her with a deep-seated mistrust of anyone and everyone, embodied by the scars on her arms where a boyfriend injured her in the middle of the night. R wistfully recalls her stillborn baby, born when she was 14. Since breaking up with the baby's dad, who left her for someone else, and with a second fiancé, who cheated on her after his release from prison, R is currently dating an older man with two infants born to different mothers -- and, despite big dreams, she is not sure how much she should hope for.
R'S story is heartbreaking. But the story of Port Clinton over the last half-century -- like the history of America over these decades -- is not simply about the collapse of the working class but also about the birth of a new upper class. In the last two decades, just as the traditional economy of Port Clinton was collapsing, wealthy professionals from major cities in the Midwest have flocked to Port Clinton, building elaborate mansions in gated communities along Lake Erie and filling lagoons with their yachts. By 2011, the child poverty rate along the shore in upscale Catawba was only 1 percent, a fraction of the 51 percent rate only a few hundred yards inland. As the once thriving middle class disappeared, adjacent real estate listings in the Port Clinton News Herald advertised near-million-dollar mansions and dilapidated double-wides.
The contrast with the egalitarian ethos and reality of the 1950s -- the contrast between the upward mobility experienced by J and the bleak prospects of R -- vividly captures Port Clinton's transformation in the last half-century, much like that of the rest of the country. My research team has talked with dozens of R's from Austin, Tex., to Duluth, Minn., and from Atlanta to Orange County, Calif.
The crumbling of the American dream is a purple problem, obscured by solely red or solely blue lenses. Its economic and cultural roots are entangled, a mixture of government, private sector, community and personal failings. But the deepest root is our radically shriveled sense of "we." Everyone in my parents' generation thought of J as one of "our kids," but surprisingly few adults in Port Clinton today are even aware of R's existence, and even fewer would likely think of her as "our kid." Until we treat the millions of R's across America as our own kids, we will pay a major economic price, and talk of the American dream will increasingly seem cynical historical fiction.

And stands about the woodland ride
Wearing white for Eastertide.
Now, of my threescore years and ten,
Twenty will not come again,
And take from seventy springs a score,
It only leaves me fifty more.
And since to look at things in bloom
Fifty springs are little room,
About the woodlands I will go
To see the cherry hung with snow.

7. What is the setting of "The Eagle," by Alfred, Lord Tennyson? Why is the setting important to the poem's meaning?
The Eagle
He clasps the crag with crooked hands;
Close to the sun in lonely lands,
Ring'd with the azure world, he stands.
The wrinkled sea beneath him crawls;
He watches from his mountain walls,
And like a thunderbolt he falls.
BRUCE ALBERTS, professor emeritus, biochemistry and biophysics, University of California, San Francisco; former editor in chief, Science magazine
8. "The society of scientists is simple because it has a directing purpose: to explore the truth. Nevertheless, it has to solve the problem of every society, which is to find a compromise between" the individual and the group. "It must encourage the single scientist to be independent, and the body of scientists to be tolerant. From these basic conditions, which form the prime values, there follows step by step a range of values: dissent, freedom of thought and speech, justice, honor, human dignity and self respect." -- Jacob Bronowski, "Science and Human Values," 1956
Think carefully about the above excerpt. Which of the following extrapolations are true? Which are false?
a. A scientist must be an independent thinker free to disagree with the status quo, and the body of scientists must be tolerant of challenges.
b. Most challenges to the status quo will change what scientists believe about the world.
c. Successful scientists are individualists who pay little attention to what other scientists have discovered.
d. New findings require independent testing before being accepted as "the truth." A scientist must therefore report results openly so they can be readily repeated, challenged and built upon.
JAMES LIPTON, host, Bravo's "Inside the Actors Studio"; founding dean, Actors Studio Drama School of Pace University

Abstract: The painfully long and slow recovery of the American economy stumbled last month as employers added a disappointing 162,000 jobs, the government reported on Friday, leaving uncertainty about the timing of the Federal Reserve's plans to begin tapering its extraordinary efforts to revive healthy growth after the financial crisis that hit the world five years ago.

Full text:   The painfully long and slow recovery of the American economy stumbled last month as employers added a disappointing 162,000 jobs, the government reported on Friday, leaving uncertainty about the timing of the Federal Reserve's plans to begin tapering its extraordinary efforts to revive healthy growth after the financial crisis that hit the world five years ago.
The unemployment rate, which comes from a different survey, gave a more encouraging signal, edging down to 7.4 percent from 7.6 percent in June. But the improvement was only partly a result of more people getting jobs. More people also dropped out of the labor force. The unemployment rate refers only to people who are actively looking for work.
While the jobs report was lackluster, particularly compared to expectations that the economy might add closer to 200,000 jobs, many economists said the latest data was unlikely, on its own, to cause Federal Reserve officials to back away from plans to begin easing its stimulus policies. Ben S. Bernanke, chairman of the Fed, has said that the central bank would start reducing its monthly purchases of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities "later this year." Many Wall Street analysts have interpreted that comment as pointing to action as early as the Fed's meeting in September.
"The payroll numbers were a little disappointing, but the Fed has said it's more interested in the unemployment rate than the payroll numbers," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. He noted that the Fed's own forecasts put the unemployment rate around 7.2 to 7.3 percent at the end of this year, not far below the July level. Referring to inflation, he said, "If anything, today's numbers would harden my view if I were a hawk and persuade me to become more hawkish if I were wavering."
Not everyone agreed with that view, with several analysts suggesting the Fed might wait until December to take its first step. The mixed signals from July's jobs report will most likely focus even more attention on August's jobs snapshot, the last before the Fed's next meeting, scheduled for the middle of September.
"The committee needs to see more data on macroeconomic performance for the second half of 2013 before making a judgment on this matter," James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis and one of the members of the Fed committee that sets interest rates who is more dovish on inflation, said in a speech on Friday.
Other indicators also painted a somewhat darker picture of the economy and the job market than was evident from reports earlier this year, with both average hourly wages and the length of the private sector workweek shrinking modestly in July. The job gains reported on Friday were concentrated in retail, food services, financial activities and wholesale trade, according to the Labor Department. Manufacturing gained 6,000 jobs, the first improvement since February, although economists caution that the timing of auto plant shutdowns in the summer can distort the numbers.
July represented the 34th consecutive month of job creation, but the latest pace of employment gains is still far below what would be needed to absorb the backlog of unemployed workers anytime soon. At the roughly 192,000-a-month average rate of job growth so far this year, it would take more than seven years to close the so-called jobs gap left by the recession, according to the Hamilton Project at the Brookings Institution. There are now 11.5 million Americans looking for work who cannot find it. That figure nearly doubles when two other groups of "underemployed" workers are taken into account: people who want to work but have stopped looking, and people who are working part time because they cannot secure full-time jobs. The number of Americans in so-called involuntary part-time employment has barely budged in recent years, and the total for July 2013 was exactly the same as a year earlier.
For these unemployed and underemployed workers, the social safety net that has been supporting them has frayed as a result of federal, state and local budget cuts.
"I honestly didn't think it would be this hard," said Keith Aiken, 38, who moved into a homeless shelter in Greensboro, N.C., about a month ago. His employer of more than a decade, a group home for people with disabilities, shut down last August, and he has been looking for work ever since.
After state officials ended North Carolina's eligibility for federal unemployment benefits last month, Mr. Aiken's benefits stopped and he was no longer able to pay his rent.
"Hopefully, something will come open pretty soon," he said, noting that he was looking into contract labor in Iraq or Afghanistan. "I like to think I'm down but not quite out yet."
The outlook for hiring is unclear, particularly since even the moderate rates of job growth in recent months do not seem justified by the weak gains in economic output. The nation's gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 1.7 percent in the second quarter and 1.1 percent in the first quarter, much slower than would be predicted from recent hiring trends.
Economic output and job growth seem unlikely to stay decoupled for too long, some economists say, in which case output growth should start to pick up, or job growth should start to slow, or both.
"I think with the economy showing 1 percent growth on average over the last three quarters, you're locked into 150,000 jobs per month for the rest of this year," said Steven Ricchiuto, chief United States economist at Mizuho Securities.
One other possible explanation for the seemingly incongruous trends in job and output growth is the mix of jobs being created.
"It's a lot of temp services, retail, food services, health care," said Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist at MFR Inc.
"With low-end jobs contributing more than half the growth, the income generated would be not that great, and you wouldn't be expecting it to drive strong consumer spending."
