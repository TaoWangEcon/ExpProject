Full text: The Peruvian writer Mario Vargas Llosa, whose deeply political work vividly examines the perils of power and corruption in Latin America, won the 2010 Nobel Prize in Literature on Thursday.
Announcing the award in Stockholm, the Swedish Academy praised Mr. Vargas Llosa "for his cartography of the structures of power and his trenchant images of the individual's resistance, revolt and defeat."
Mr. Vargas Llosa, 74, is one of the most celebrated writers of the Spanish-speaking world, an anti-totalitarian intellectual whose work covers the range of human experience, whether it is ideology or eros. He is frequently mentioned with his contemporary Gabriel Garcia Marquez, who won the literature Nobel in 1982, the last South American to do so. Mr. Vargas Llosa has written more than 30 works of nonfiction, plays and novels, including "The Feast of the Goat" and "The War of the End of the World."
The prize is the first for a writer in the Spanish language in two decades, after Octavio Paz of Mexico won in 1990. It renews attention on the Latin American writers who gained renown in the 1960s, like Julio Cortazar of Argentina and Carlos Fuentes of Mexico, who formed the region's "boom generation."
During a news conference at the Instituto Cervantes in Manhattan on Thursday, Mr. Vargas Llosa, an elegant, dashing figure with silvery hair, appeared in front of a crowd of giddy journalists, mostly Spanish-speaking, and Alejandro Toledo, the former president of Peru, who sat in the front row. Mr. Vargas Llosa is currently spending the semester in the United States, teaching Latin American studies at Princeton.
Answering questions in English, Spanish and a bit of French, Mr. Vargas Llosa called the Nobel a recognition of the importance of Latin American literature and of the Spanish language, which has acquired "a sort of citizenship in the world," he said.
When Mr. Vargas Llosa was young and went to Europe for the first time, he said, "Latin America seemed to be a land where there were only dictators, revolutionaries, catastrophes. Now we know that Latin America can produce also artists, musicians, painters, thinkers and novelists."
The announcement of the prize was greeted largely with enthusiasm in Latin America, where Mr. Vargas Llosa is widely admired for his literary greatness but is a divisive figure because of his conservative politics. He has frequently criticized leftist governments in the region, including those of Cuba and Venezuela.
In Peru, members of Congress took to the floor to praise him. People celebrated in Arequipa, the provincial city where he was born, with Peruvian television showing a band playing the national anthem in the streets.
Felipe Calderon, Mexico's president, wrote in a Twitter message that the prize was cause for "Latin American pride."
But illustrating the mixed sentiment that Mr. Vargas Llosa's views elicit among some in the region, the Mexican writer Paco Ignacio Taibo II said that while the prize was "absolutely deserved," Mr. Vargas Llosa himself was "deplorable as a citizen and as a person."
In selecting Mr. Vargas Llosa, the Swedish Academy has once again made a literary choice tinged with politics, though this time from the right instead of the left.
Recent winners of the literature Nobel include Herta Muller, the Romanian-born German novelist; Orhan Pamuk of Turkey; and Harold Pinter of Britain.
"It's very difficult for a Latin American writer to avoid politics," Mr. Vargas Llosa said on Thursday. "Literature is an expression of life, and you cannot eradicate politics from life."
In the days leading up to the announcement, the reliably unreliable speculation over who would win focused on the Kenyan author Ngugi wa Thiong'o; Cormac McCarthy; the Syrian poet Adonis; Philip Roth; and Joyce Carol Oates. The last American to win was Toni Morrison, in 1993.
The awards ceremony is planned for Dec. 10 in Stockholm. Mr. Vargas Llosa will receive 10 million kronor, or about $1.5 million.
Mr. Vargas Llosa first realized that he wanted to be a writer when he was a child, enthralled with an adventure novel by Jules Verne. He spent much of his early childhood in Cochabamba, Bolivia, then moved with his parents to a middle-class suburb of Lima. He attended the University of San Marcos in Lima in the mid-1950s -- a tumultuous time in Peru -- and later drew from that experience to write "Conversation in the Cathedral," a novel published in 1969.
After college he wanted to leave Peru, and began his literary career abroad, living in London, Paris and Madrid.
His work found an international audience in the 1960s with the publication of "The Time of the Hero," a novel based on a Peruvian military academy that aroused some controversy in his home country. By the early 1980s, he was one of the best-selling Latin American writers in the world, having published "Conversation," "Green House" and the comic novel "Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter," among other works.
"They're not only fantastic novels that read beautifully," Ruben Gallo, a professor of Spanish-American literature at Princeton University, said on Thursday. "He's one of the authors who in the 20th century has written the most eloquently and the most poignantly about the intersection between culture and politics in Latin America."
A brief and unsuccessful effort to officially enter the political arena came later. While Peru was besieged by high inflation and the attacks by the Maoists of the Shining Path in 1990, Mr. Vargas Llosa made a quixotic run for the presidency, opposing Alberto Fujimori, then a little-known agronomist.
Mr. Vargas Llosa was ahead in polls for much of his campaign, but some factors may have worked against him: his aristocratic bearing in impoverished Peru and his acknowledgment that in the largely Roman Catholic country, he was an agnostic.
Mr. Fujimori triumphed, and the failed bid left Mr. Vargas Llosa with a sour taste for politics in his country.
Afterward, Mr. Vargas Llosa's influence in the Spanish-speaking world became more widespread through his column for El Pais, the Spanish daily newspaper in Madrid. The column, "Piedra de Toque," or "Touchstone," is distributed in newspapers throughout Latin America and explores themes including literature, travel and the politics of the Middle East and Latin America.
The previous Nobel laureate of the "boom generation," Mr. Garcia Marquez of Colombia, won after wide acclaim for his masterpiece, "One Hundred Years of Solitude." In a twist worthy of one of Mr. Vargas Llosa's subplots, Mr. Garcia Marquez and Mr. Vargas Llosa, at one point close friends, had a violent falling out in 1976 in Mexico City, which they have yet to patch up.
The episode unfolded at a film premiere. When Mr. Garcia Marquez approached Mr. Vargas Llosa to embrace him, the Peruvian writer instead punched him in the face, giving him a black eye, an image immortalized days later by the photographer Rodrigo Moya. Mystery shrouds what happened, but apparently the feud had to do with Mr. Vargas Llosa's wife, whom Mr. Garcia Marquez had consoled during a marital estrangement.
Confusion over the enigmatic feud persisted on Thursday, after news of a Twitter message attributed to Mr. Garcia Marquez -- which read, "Now we're even" -- made the rounds in literary circles across Latin America. Mr. Garcia Marquez's foundation in Colombia later tried to clear things up by saying the Twitter message was not authentic.
In any case, Alvaro Mutis, a Colombian writer who lives in Mexico City and is a friend of both men, told the EFE news agency that a reconciliation between the two heavyweights of Latin literature, after 34 years of rancor, was probably not going to happen.
The news that Mr. Vargas Llosa had won the prize reached him early on Thursday morning, when he was working in his apartment in Manhattan, preparing to set out on a walk through Central Park, he told a radio station in Peru. Initially, he thought it was a prank.
"It was a grand surprise," he said. "It's a good way to start a New York day."

Abstract: The collective impact of this behavior risks either causing inflation and asset bubbles in emerging economies, or else depressing consumption growth and intensifying short-term distortions in favor of exports. "If growth were to slow or even stop in advanced countries, emerging market countries would have a hard time decoupling," he said, emphasizing the interconnectedness of the world economy.\n

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner warned on Wednesday that the necessary rebalancing of the economy was "at risk of being undermined" by countries trying to prevent their currencies from rising in value.
Mr. Geithner, in a speech at the Brookings Institution, said some of the world's biggest economies should "focus on strengthening growth, rather than risking a premature shift to restraint" by cutting government spending too rapidly.
His message -- aimed at countries like China and Germany, but also an appeal for support from other major economies -- came as the International Monetary Fundpredicted that the world economy would grow 4.2 percent next year, down from the estimate of 4.8 percent for this year, but that "a sharper global slowdown is unlikely."
As finance officials from around the world gather here this weekend for the annual meetings of the I.M.F. and the World Bank, American officials are concerned that the degree of cooperation in the recent financial crisis is eroding. In particular, the Obama administration is looking to the I.M.F. to help bring about what months of negotiations have failed to achieve: greater exchange-rate flexibility by China.
Instead of the "competitive devaluation" of the 1930s, which exacerbated the Depression, the world faces a threat of "competitive nonappreciation," Mr. Geithner said, citing a term coined by Edwin M. Truman, a former official at the Treasury and the Federal Reserve.
That was a reference not only to China but also Japan and Brazil, which have taken steps recently to prevent their currencies from rising in value.
"Over time, more and more countries face stronger pressure to lean against the market forces pushing up the value of their currencies," Mr. Geithner said.
"The collective impact of this behavior risks either causing inflation and asset bubbles in emerging economies, or else depressing consumption growth and intensifying short-term distortions in favor of exports."
In his speech, Mr. Geithner called the problem a "damaging dynamic" and a collective problem that "requires a collective approach to solve."
Later, in a question-and-answer session, Mr. Geithner said that "China will be less likely to move, to allow its currency to appreciate more rapidly, if it's not confident that other countries will move with it."
China did not appear to be in the mood to be flexible on Wednesday. In Brussels, Premier Wen Jiabao criticized European Union leaders who have called for a stronger Chinese currency. "Europe shouldn't join the choir," he told a business conference, according to Bloomberg News. If the renminbi "isn't stable, it will bring disaster to China and the world." If China were to increase the renminbi "by 20 to 40 percent as some people are calling for, many of our factories will shut down and society will be in turmoil."
Mr. Geithner's warnings were echoed, in crucial respects, by the I.M.F., which released its latest World Economic Outlook on Wednesday.
"The world economic recovery is proceeding," the I.M.F. chief economist, Olivier J. Blanchard, said at a news conference. "But it is an unbalanced recovery, sluggish in advanced countries, much stronger in emerging and developing countries."
As many as 210 million people worldwide may be unemployed, an increase of more than 30 million since 2007, the report found. Three-fourths of the increase has been in the most-developed economies.
In those advanced economies, growth is now projected at 2.7 percent for this year and 2.2 percent for next year -- compared with 7.1 percent and 6.4 percent, respectively, for emerging and developing economies.
Developing Asia, which does not include Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, is expected again to lead the world in growth, with projected rates of 9.4 percent this year and 8.4 percent next year.
The fund left its growth projections for China -- 10.5 percent this year and 9.6 percent next year, the highest of any major economy -- unchanged from July.
The fund slightly revised downward its projections for the United States, whose economy is projected to grow 2.6 percent this year and 2.3 percent next year. The euro area's economy is expected to expand 1.7 percent this year and 1.5 percent next year.
The European projections were a slight uptick from July projections, largely on account of stronger-than-forecast growth in Germany, whose economy is expected to expand by 3.3 percent this year and 2 percent next year.
The biggest economies need to carefully calibrate efforts to restrain government deficits and debts without derailing the recovery by cutting off fiscal support too sharply, Mr. Blanchard said.
"If growth were to slow or even stop in advanced countries, emerging market countries would have a hard time decoupling," he said, emphasizing the interconnectedness of the world economy. "The need for careful design at the national level, and coordination at the global level, may be even more important today than they were at the peak of the crisis a year and a half ago."
In his remarks at the Brookings Institution, Mr. Geithner suggested that the European debt crisis had caused an overreaction.
"What happened in Europe in the spring was very, very damaging," he said. The euro zone nations "took a long time, far too long" to agree to support their most heavily indebted members. The result, he said, was doubts about "whether Europe had the will or the ability to stand behind their members" and "an exaggerated shift" toward restraint in the healthier, bigger economies.
Mr. Geithner said it was critical to distinguish countries like Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain, which he said "had no choice but to move very, very aggressively" to cut spending, from bigger, less indebted economies like the United States, which continue to enjoy very low interest rates for long-term borrowing, giving them more short-term room to maneuver.
But he also conceded that it was imperative for Congress and the administration to reach agreement on long-term measures to reduce the American deficit and stabilize the nation's public debt level.

Abstract: In its most recent economic outlook report, even the International Monetary Fund -- historically a paragon of fiscal austerity -- laid to rest the idea that cutting budgets would trigger fast growth by restoring confidence in financial investors.

Full text: "No more stimulus" has become the destructive mantra of conservative politicians here and across Europe. Britain has vowed to cut the budget of most government departments by 25 percent to 40 percent over the next four years. Germany's government has adopted its own slash-and-burn austerity plan.
Republicans in Congress have tried -- too successfully -- to block, cut back or delay anything that looks like more stimulus, most recently legislation that would have provided jobs to 250,000 low-income workers.
The enormous cost of these miscalculations should now be evident to all as the fragile global recovery falters. Economies in euro-zone countries are expected to expand by only 1.7 percent in 2010, on average, and 1.5 percent in 2011. The United States' economy is forecast to grow 2.6 percent this year and 2.3 percent next -- better than Europe's but nowhere near enough.
Last week, the International Labor Organization said it would take until 2015 for employment in advanced economies to rise back to 2007 levels, two years more than it predicted last year.
In its most recent economic outlook report, even the International Monetary Fund -- historically a paragon of fiscal austerity -- laid to rest the idea that cutting budgets would trigger fast growth by restoring confidence in financial investors. It suggested that while fiscal adjustment should start "in earnest" next year, it said the objective should be to "achieve sustainable fiscal positions before the end of the decade." If global growth threatens to slow appreciably, it said, countries with the ability to borrow should postpone the budget-cutting.
The Obama administration rightly argues that the deficit must be addressed, but with unemployment high and inflation low, the most urgent task is to stimulate demand to bolster growth. It hasn't had much luck getting that across in Congress -- even with cowering members of the Democratic Party -- or to other big economies. (It has even bowed to political pressure and signed on to a premature vow to cut the deficit in half by 2013.)
There is a Group of 20 summit meeting in Seoul, South Korea, in November. President Obama should use that meeting, and the grim figures on faltering growth, to press a lot harder for sustained support of the global economy. He must argue just as hard at home for more stimulus. The deficit must be addressed -- but, first, the economy needs to recover.

Abstract: [...] the New York Federal Reserve president, William C. Dudley, said in a speech that bank officials had the tools that could provide additional stimulus at costs that do not appear to be prohibitive. [...] I conclude that further action is likely to be warranted, Mr. Dudley said, unless the economic outlook evolves in a way that makes me more confident that we will see better outcomes for both employment and inflation before too long.

Full text: Shares on Wall Street rose on Friday as Federal Reserve officials continued to suggest that they would undertake further monetary easing.
The major indexes began the fourth quarter on a positive note after economic reports showed that personal income, consumer sentiment and manufacturing were generally in line with forecasts.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 41.63 points, or 0.39 percent, at 10,829.68. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 5.04 points, or 0.44 percent, at 1,146.24 and the Nasdaq was 2.13 points, or 0.09 percent, higher at 2,370.75.
All three indexes were generally flat for the week.
United and Continental closed their merger on Friday. Shares of the newly combined company, United Continental Holdings, rose 25 cents, or 1.07 percent, to $23.66.
In the bond market, the price of the 10-year Treasury note was unchanged at 101, and the yield was unchanged at 2.51 percent.
After the major indexes ended the third quarter on Thursday with increases, investors are now focusing on the next corporate earnings season in hopes that it will inspire future rallies.
Peter Cardillo, chief market economist for Avalon Partners, said the Fed was adding to the impetus for the possibility of further monetary easing.
On Friday, two Fed officials added their voices to the recent remarks suggesting such measures were in store for the economy.
The president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, Charles L. Evans, said during a speech in Rome that more monetary easing might be "desirable."
And the New York Federal Reserve president, William C. Dudley, said in a speech that bank officials had the tools that could provide additional stimulus "at costs that do not appear to be prohibitive."
"Thus, I conclude that further action is likely to be warranted," Mr. Dudley said, "unless the economic outlook evolves in a way that makes me more confident that we will see better outcomes for both employment and inflation before too long."
He also noted that, in light of the Fed's dual mandate of creating the highest level of employment while consistent with price stability, "the current situation is wholly unsatisfactory."
Economists interpreted his remarks to mean that there was the strong possibility that further measures would be announced after the Federal Open Market Committee's meeting in November.
Government reports showed personal income was up 0.5 percent in August, an improvement over the previous two months, and spending rose 0.4 percent.
"I think that the economic data is stronger than expected, and the personal income numbers provided a starting point" for the market, said Alan Gayle, a senior investment strategist at RidgeWorth Capital Management. "But the fact that the market is being backstopped by the prospect of additional Fed support I think is making investors more confident of stepping in," he said.
Also on the economic front, the Institute for Supply Management reported that its survey of manufacturing fellto 54.4 percent in September, from 56.3 percent. in August. The latest reading was slightly lower than the 54.5 that economists polled by Reuters had forecast. Any reading above 50 on the index indicates that the sector is expanding, and shares of Boeing, General Electric and 3M rose on the news.
In addition, the Commerce Department reported that spending on construction rose slightly, or 0.4 percent, in August, though the rise was mainly a result of government projects. The slight rise came after a decline of 1.4 percent for July.
Joshua Shapiro, the chief United States economist with MFR, said that the new orders index in the manufacturing report declined, indicating weak final demand growth. Energy, materials and financials were all up more than 1 percent at the close, with manufacturers up. Boeing ended up 29 cents at $66.83, and General Electric rose 11 cents to $16.36.
Technology shares were down less than 1 percent, the only sector in the broader market to show a decline.
Meanwhile, the University of Michigan consumer sentiment index for September was revised slightly higher, to 68.2 points, from an earlier estimate of 66.6.

Wall Street Slips at End Of an Upbeat Quarter

Full text: Shares fell Thursday on Wall Street, but the broader market ended the third quarter with its strongest three-month performance in a year.
Shares started higher on Thursday, helped by reports on weekly unemployment claims, economic growth and regional manufacturing output that exceeded expectations. But as the day wore on, the major indexes slipped, taking some of the edge off a September rally and raising questions about whether the surge could be maintained.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 47.23 points, or 0.4 percent, at 10,788.05. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 3.53 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,141.20, while the Nasdaq composite index dropped 7.94 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,368.62.
The broader market, using the S.& P. as a gauge, has risen nearly 9 percent this month, its best September performance since 1939. The index has risen 10.72 percent in the three months from June 30, its best quarter since the third period of 2009. The Dow gained 10 percent in the quarter and the Nasdaq rose 12.29 percent.
Tom di Galoma, head of United States rates trading at Guggenheim Securities, attributed the rally to the Federal Reserve. "The start of the bull market in the last quarter," Mr. di Galoma said, came after the Fed's announcement in August that it would try to bolster the economy by buying long-term Treasuries and the subsequent talk of quantitative easing.
Analysts said the rally occurred despite the relative absence of improved economic data, meaning investors had probably adjusted their expectations. In addition, trading volume in the quarter was down 23 percent compared with the year-earlier period as uncertainty kept many investors on the sidelines.
"The market moved up on good news but did not move down on bad news," said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst for Standard & Poor's. "There is still an enormous amount of uncertainty about where to put your money."
Most of the data in the quarter reinforced the notion that the economy was growing, though very slowly, calming concerns about the potential for a double-dip recession.
The broadest measure of the nation's economic activity, gross domestic product, for example, grew in the second quarter at an annual pace of 1.7 percent, down from 3.7 percent in the first. While government data in the first two months of the quarter showed that businesses added more jobs than originally estimated, the unemployment rate remained just below 10 percent.
And the housing industry continued to struggle, feeling the fallout from the expired home buyer tax credit. Sales tumbled 27 percent in July, their second-weakest level since 1997, though they started to stabilize in August.
For most of the quarter, the Fed was a factor in the markets. Its announcement in early August that it would buy long-term Treasury debt with proceeds from its mortgage-related bond portfolio reassured traders, at least for a while. Last week, the Fed said that it was worried that the sluggish recovery could be undermined by very low rates of inflation.
The Fed's policy-making arm then deferred a decision on whether to begin a new push to speed the recovery by additional purchases of financial assets, which would increase the money supply. Stock prices responded by initially rising before falling back in the absence of bolder steps.
Jeffrey Nichols, the senior economic adviser to Rosland Capital, said rising expectations of more creation of money by the Fed helped gold prices shatter the psychologically important level of $1,300 an ounce.
"I think the latest news suggesting that they might buy a range of securities without any time frame was taken as being sort of an open-ended possibility of much greater monetary easing, which is positive for gold," Mr. Nichols said. "There are enough investors who are worried about inflation, and expectations are rising because of Fed policy."
Since the Fed's Aug. 10 decision to buy government debt, "more investors took a greater interest in gold," said Mr. Nichols, who is also the managing director of American Precious Metals Advisors.
In general, Treasury rates have fallen steadily through the quarter. The price of the 10-year Treasury note fell 2/32, to 101, on Thursday, while the yield rose to 2.51 percent from 2.50 percent late Wednesday.
In the currency market, the dollar finished the third quarter lower against a range of currencies, including the yen.
Japan intervened in international currency markets in September for the first time since 2004, buying dollars and selling yen and weakening its currency in a bid to protect its export-led economy.
"It has been a miserable quarter for the U.S. dollar," Marc Chandler, the global head of currency strategy for Brown Brothers Harriman, said.
Even so, the dollar was still higher against the euro and the British pound than it was at the beginning of the year.
"In some ways, the big picture for the third quarter was very unusual," Mr. Chandler said, "in the sense that the stock market rallied, bonds rallied and gold rallied."

Abstract: Cuts for the middle class are now on the table throughout Europe, as governments struggle to close budget deficits and reduce debt levels that now average 84 percent of gross domestic product.

Full text: LONDON -- Every week without fail Lucy Elkin, a comfortably middle-class mother of two small children, receives a $:33.20 child benefit payment, or about $52, from the debt-plagued British government.
"It's useful and it helps pay the bills, but it is not as if we are struggling to put food on the table," Ms. Elkin said as she led her children from the park to their house on the leafy fringe of Hampstead Heath, one of London's most desirable neighborhoods.
Ms. Elkin, 40, is a freelance writer. Her husband is a computer programmer. Along with more than three million middle- to upper-income British families, they are among the recipients of $:11 billion ($17.2 billion) a year paid to mothers with children here. It is a universal benefit that not only costs taxpayers about twice as much as the total for unemployment payments but also represents the largest chunk of the estimated $:30 billion ($47 billion) the government pays each year to Britons with above-average incomes.
"It is one of those things that is quite hard to justify," Ms. Elkin said.
She is not alone in thinking that Britain can no longer afford such generosities. But even as civil servants and ministers are preparing to drastically cut most categories of government spending to help close Britain's budget deficit, the government is so worried about alienating middle-class voters that it is proceeding very cautiously in limiting the subsidy for having children.
"There is a long history of universal welfare schemes here," said Patrick Nolan, an economist for Reform, a free-market-oriented research organization that has issued a report claiming that as much as 16 percent of total welfare benefits go to those who do not need them. "But it has become a very expensive luxury when hundreds of thousands are losing their jobs."
The debate in Britain highlights an issue that other advanced industrial countries are also beginning to grapple with: Who should bear the burden of the coming wave of austerity?
Unless politicians are prepared to dig into the pockets of middle- and upper-income families, experts say, the demands from bond market investors to get government finances under control can be satisfied only by cutting back even further on benefits for the poor and needy. But any serious effort to curb long-established middle-class entitlements risks setting off a public reaction that few political leaders are eager to face.
In Britain, the quandary is particularly stark. The social safety net that has been an essential feature of British life since World War II ended has been built largely on providing similar benefits to all, like health care and home heating allowances for the elderly, regardless of income.
Those earning up to $:37,400 a year pay income tax of 20 percent per year.
All told, about a third of Britain's 61 million people claim either a child subsidy or winter heating allowance. Together they represent a formidable political bloc of families and senior citizens that Prime Minister David Cameron was loath to alienate during last spring's election.
That helps explain why Mr. Cameron promised not to "means test" the child benefit by limiting it to the poor. He said that payments to the elderly to subsidize television license fees, along with bus fare and heating allowances, would not be touched, either.
Lately, though, the government has begun to signal a harder line.
At the Liberal Democrat's party conference in September, Mr. Cameron's coalition partner, Nick Clegg, made the strongest call yet for cutting middle-class benefits, telling delegates that he would be willing to give up the $:2,450 ($3,850) in annual child benefits that he and his wife, who is a corporate lawyer, receive for their three children.
It remains unclear whether the government will follow through on that suggestion. But there is little question that social protection, as it is labeled in government accounts, has been the locomotive behind the 53 percent increase in overall outlays, adjusted for inflation, over the last eight years.
This spending spike was driven by previous Labour governments supplying the extra padding to make the British welfare state one of the most accommodating in Europe.
Cuts for the middle class are now on the table throughout Europe, as governments struggle to close budget deficits and reduce debt levels that now average 84 percent of gross domestic product. In France, the government is planning to raise the retirement age from 60 to 62; in Greece, public-sector pensions have been sharply cut, and in Ireland government wages have been reduced by more than 10 percent.
But with protests mounting, most governments have said that any further cuts in benefits to the middle class were unlikely. And in the United States, where demands are rising from the right to cut government outlays, none of the advocates have proposed reducing such sacrosanct middle-class benefits as the tax deduction for interest on home mortgages or the tax breaks for pensions and retirement savings.
As for Britain, while universal child benefits are common in Europe, total payments to families here -- including child tax credits and maternity allowances -- are the third-highest among the 33 affluent countries that belong to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, trailing France and Luxembourg.
The child benefit pays $:20 a week to the oldest child and $:13.20 for each additional child until they reach the age of 20. The only requirement is that they continue to attend school.
Research shows that, although payments are promoted as a direct and simple means to allay child poverty by putting money into the hands of needy mothers, nearly half of the payments go to families with above-average incomes.
According to a soon-to-be-published study by Ian Walker, an economist at Lancaster University, well-to-do families that received the benefit were more inclined to spend it on themselves, not their children -- with alcohol and tobacco among the most notorious substitutes.
These findings make a "good case for means-testing the benefit," Mr. Walker said. "It's clear that a number of universal benefits look vulnerable."
But many poverty experts strongly defend universal payments, arguing that, despite the excesses, the largest portion of the money goes to those who really need it and that paying benefits across the board is the best way to preserve political support for such programs.
The British government, apart from pensions, pays large sums to the elderly, much of which ends up in the pockets of more affluent citizens. The government spends $:2.7 billion ($4.24 billion) a year to provide a winter heating allowance to everyone over the age of 60. It provides $:1 billion for free bus passes for those senior citizens and devotes $:575 million for complimentary TV licenses for people 75 and older.
Opposition to spending cuts is already building, and unions across the country are banding together, promising a series of strikes. They are expected to culminate in a mass protest on Oct. 19, the day before the government makes public its spending review.
Still, while the fear and anger about the coming cuts are certainly palpable here, there are signs that many Britons are reluctantly coming to the conclusion that the fairest way to deal with the need for austerity may be to bring the era of universal largess to an end.
"It would be nice to give everyone a nice slice of the cake," said Clare Drew, an unemployed mother of two, who has just moved back to London from Ireland and is staying at her mother's until her housing and child benefits come through.
"But with the economy this way, you just can't do that," she continued. "The benefits are going to be decreased."

Abstract: [...] say prominent Chinese figures, it doesn't matter; the renminbi has nothing to do with China's trade surplus.

Full text: Serious people were appalled by Wednesday's vote in the House of Representatives, where a huge bipartisan majority approved legislation, sponsored by Representative Sander Levin, that would potentially pave the way for sanctions against China over its currency policy. As a substantive matter, the bill was very mild; nonetheless, there were dire warnings of trade war and global economic disruption. Better, said respectable opinion, to pursue quiet diplomacy.
But serious people, who have been wrong about so many things since this crisis began -- remember how budget deficits were going to lead to skyrocketing interest rates and soaring inflation? -- are wrong on this issue, too. Diplomacy on China's currency has gone nowhere, and will continue going nowhere unless backed by the threat of retaliation. The hype about trade war is unjustified -- and, anyway, there are worse things than trade conflict. In a time of mass unemployment, made worse by China's predatory currency policy, the possibility of a few new tariffs should be way down on our list of worries.
Let's step back and look at the current state of the world.
Major advanced economies are still reeling from the effects of a burst housing bubble and the financial crisis that followed. Consumer spending is depressed, and firms see no point in expanding when they aren't selling enough to use the capacity they have. The recession may be officially over, but unemployment is extremely high and shows no sign of returning to normal levels.
The situation is quite different, however, in emerging economies. These economies have weathered the economic storm, they are fighting inflation rather than deflation, and they offer abundant investment opportunities. Naturally, capital from wealthier but depressed nations is flowing in their direction. And emerging nations could and should play an important role in helping the world economy as a whole pull out of its slump.
But China, the largest of these emerging economies, isn't allowing this natural process to unfold. Restrictions on foreign investment limit the flow of private funds into China; meanwhile, the Chinese government is keeping the value of its currency, the renminbi, artificially low by buying huge amounts of foreign currency, in effect subsidizing its exports. And these subsidized exports are hurting employment in the rest of the world.
Chinese officials defend this policy with arguments that are both implausible and wildly inconsistent.
They deny that they are deliberately manipulating their exchange rate; I guess the tooth fairy purchased $2.4 trillion in foreign currency and put it on their pillows while they were sleeping. Anyway, say prominent Chinese figures, it doesn't matter; the renminbi has nothing to do with China's trade surplus. Yet this week China's premier cried woe over the prospect of a stronger currency, declaring, "We cannot imagine how many Chinese factories will go bankrupt, how many Chinese workers will lose their jobs." Well, either the renminbi's value matters, or it doesn't -- they can't have it both ways.
Meanwhile, about diplomacy: China's government has shown no hint of helpfulness and seems to go out of its way to flaunt its contempt for U.S. negotiators. In June, the Chinese supposedly agreed to allow their currency to move toward a market-determined rate -- which, if the example of economies like Brazil is any indication, would have meant a sharp rise in the renminbi's value. But, as of Thursday, China's currency had risen about only 2 percent against the dollar -- with most of that rise taking place in just the past few weeks, clearly in anticipation of the vote on the Levin bill.
So what will the bill accomplish? It empowers U.S. officials to impose tariffs against Chinese exports subsidized by the artificially low renminbi, but it doesn't require these officials to take action. And judging from past experience, U.S. officials will not, in fact, take action -- they'll continue to make excuses, to tout imaginary diplomatic progress, and, in general, to confirm China's belief that they are paper tigers.
The Levin bill is, then, a signal at best -- and it's at least as much a shot across the bow of U.S. officials as it is a signal to the Chinese. But it's a step in the right direction.
For the truth is that U.S. policy makers have been incredibly, infuriatingly passive in the face of China's bad behavior -- especially because taking on China is one of the few policy options for tackling unemployment available to the Obama administration, given Republican obstructionism on everything else. The Levin bill probably won't change that passivity. But it will, at least, start to build a fire under policy makers, bringing us closer to the day when, at long last, they are ready to act.

Full text: Markets in the United States on Tuesday erased most of their losses from Monday, as Walgreen led a rally in consumer staples and health companies. Investors also speculated that the Federal Reserve would buy more debt to safeguard the economy.
Walgreen, the country's largest drugstore chain, jumped 11 percent to $33.81 as earnings topped estimates. Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson lifted health care shares after the Supreme Courtagreed to hear an appeal by pharmaceutical companies seeking to block thousands of public hospitals from suing over a federal discount drug program.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 0.49 percent, or 5.54 points, to 1,147.70. The Dow Jones industrial average increased 46.10 points, or 0.43 percent, to 10,858.14, while the Nasdaq gained 9.82 points, or 0.41 percent, to 2,379.59.
"Investors are getting more comfortable with taking some risk as it sounds like the Fed's goal is to increase inflation," said Eric Green, director of research at Penn Capital Management in Philadelphia. "If the economy doesn't get better, there seems to be a belief the Fed is going to stimulate through purchases. If it does get better, that's good for stocks also."
The expectations on the Fed's actions also helped gold hit another record, as it rose $14.70 to close at $1,309.05.
The S.& P. 500 has rallied about 9 percent since the end of August, poised for its best month since April 2009 and its biggest September rally since 1939 as concern eased that Europe's debt crisis and unemployment would derail the economic rebound.
The Fed announced after its Sept. 21 meeting that it was prepared to do more to help the economy, spurring speculation that policy makers would add Treasury securities to the central bank's holdings. The central bank on Tuesday purchased $550 million of Treasury inflation-protected securities as part of a program to reinvest principal payments on its mortgage holdings into long-term government debt.
The Treasury's 10-year note rose 16/32, to 101 12/32. The yield fell to 2.47 percent, from 2.52 percent late Monday.
A bigger-than-estimated decrease in consumer confidence helped fuel speculation of another round of quantitative easing. The Conference Board's consumer confidence index declined to 48.5, lower than forecast, from 53.2 in the previous month.
Endo Pharmaceuticals rallied 8.1 percent to $33.10. The company agreed to buy Qualitest Pharmaceuticals, a generic-drug maker in the United States, for about $1.2 billion in cash from the private equity firm Apax Partners.
Broadwind Energy, a maker of wind towers, surged 27 percent to $1.87 on speculation that General Electric would acquire the company, according to Pavel Molchanov, a Raymond James & Associates equity analyst. G.E. said on Monday that it had formed a joint venture with China's Harbin Power Equipment to make and supply equipment.
Amedisys dropped 16 percent to $24.02. The company, a home nursing provider, was asked by prosecutors for information related to Medicare reimbursements and billing claims by its 31 Alabama home health operations.
Monsanto fell 8.1 percent to $48.75, bringing its two-day drop to 12 percent. Initial field data on Monsanto's SmartStax genetically modified corn showed weaker-than-expected performance, the Jefferies Group wrote in a note. Separately, Nufarm of Australia reported that 2010 North American sales of glyphosate, a herbicide also sold by Monsanto, fell 44 percent over the previous year.
Investors' sentiment on stocks has fallen to panic levels, an indication that the equity market will rise over the next six to 12 months, said Tobias Levkovich, chief United States equity strategist at Citigroup. The bank has a panic-euphoria model, which declined to as low as minus 0.49 this month. In March 2009, the gauge had dropped to minus 0.46, when the S.& P. 500-stock index started a rally of as much as 80 percent on government efforts to stimulate the economy.
The measure had fallen to minus 0.36 on October 2002, when the S.& P. 500 entered a five-year rally.
"If you break below the panic line, there's a 90 percent probability that stocks will be up in six months," Mr. Levkovich said. "There's about a 97 percent probability that stocks will be up 12 months later."

Full text: New Haven
ON Wednesday, the House of Representatives is set to pass legislation that would allow trade sanctions to be imposed on China as compensation for its supposedly undervalued currency. This vote comes a week after President Obama, in a private meeting with Prime Minister Wen Jiabao, was reported to have made it very clear that the United States is, indeed, prepared to take forceful actions if China doesn't budge on this critical issue. Unfortunately, forcing such a currency realignment would be a blunder of historic proportions.
In a recent meeting with Mr. Wen in New York, I framed the dispute between our two nations in a very different light. The gist of what I told him is this: The economic tensions between the United States and China arise because of two things we have in common.
First, there is our shared fixation on jobs. In the United States, we continue to struggle with high rates of unemployment and underemployment. In China, policymakers continue to worry about what they term "social stability" -- that is, full employment, absorption of surplus rural labor and reduced inequalities consistent with their aspirations for a "harmonious society."
Second, for both China and the United States, there are major imbalances in the percentages of gross domestic product devoted to exports, investment, consumption and savings.
These joint concerns have resulted in serious tensions that must be resolved. There are, however, two very different potential strategies to address these tensions: a major currency realignment, favored by many in the United States, or structural policies aimed at increasing China's internal private consumption.
The currency fix won't work. At best, it is a circuitous solution that would address only one of the many pressures shaping the imbalances between our two nations; at worst, it would lead to a trade war, or risk jeopardizing China's understandable focus on financial and economic stability.
Besides, in a highly competitive world, there are no guarantees that currency shifts would be passed through to foreign customers in the form of price adjustments that might narrow trade imbalances. Similar fixes certainly didn't work for Japan in the late 1980s, and haven't worked for the United States in recent years. We've allowed the dollar to fall 23 percent -- in inflation-adjusted terms -- from its early 2002 peak, against all of our trading partners; we did this in the hopes that a weaker dollar would stimulate exports and domestic production. Yet America continues to struggle with high unemployment and stagnant wages, and now has trade deficits with 90 countries around the world.
This latter point underscores the danger in politicizing this debate. Contrary to accepted wisdom, America does not have a bilateral trade problem with China -- it has a multilateral trade problem with a broad cross-section of countries.
And why do we have these deficits? Because Americans don't save. Adjusted for depreciation, America's net national saving rate -- the sum of savings by individuals, businesses and the government sector -- fell below zero in 2008 and hit -2.3 percent of national income in 2009. This is a truly astonishing development. No leading nation in modern history has ever had such a huge shortfall of saving. And to plug that gap, we're left to borrow and to attract capital from lenders like China, Japan and Germany, which have surplus savings.
If Washington were to restrict trade with China -- either by pushing the Chinese currency sharply higher or by imposing sanctions -- it would only backfire. China could very well retaliate against American exporters, and buy goods from elsewhere (a worrisome development in what is now America's third-largest export market). Or it could start to limit its purchase of Treasury securities.
The United States would then have to turn to some other nation or nations, at a higher cost, to finance our budget deficits and make up for our subpar domestic savings. The result would be an even weaker dollar and increased long-term interest rates. Worse still, as trade was redirected away from China, already hard-pressed American families would be forced to buy products that are noticeably more expensive than Chinese-made imports.
But Washington remains unwilling to address our unprecedented saving gap, and instead tries to duck responsibility by blaming China. Scapegoating may be good politics, but proposing a bilateral fix for a multilateral problem is just bad economics.
China should stay the course with its measured currency reforms, allowing the renminbi to continue to appreciate gradually and steadily over time. Contrary to the inflammatory rhetoric of China's critics, this is not "manipulation." It is a reasonable strategy to anchor the renminbi to the world's reserve currency, the dollar, in an effort to maintain financial stability in an all-too-unstable world.
Nonetheless, China must address its role in fostering global imbalances. For China's people and its trading partners, consumption has long been the missing link in an otherwise vibrant economy. China's gross domestic saving rate is 54 percent of national income, the highest in the world for a major economy. But its consumption share of G.D.P. is only about 36 percent, the lowest for a major economy and about half the 70 percent ratio in the United States.
I would therefore urge China to opt for aggressive and immediate pro-consumption structural policies. Stimulating domestic consumer demand would be a far more direct -- and potentially a far less destabilizing -- way of reducing saving and trade imbalances than a currency realignment would be.
These policies should include an expanded social safety net, with a public retirement program, private pensions and medical and unemployment insurance. China should also provide major support for rural incomes through tax policy and land ownership reform, as well as enhanced initiatives to encourage rural-urban migration. And it should encourage the creation of service-oriented jobs in industries like retail and wholesale trade, domestic transportation, leisure and hospitality.
During our recent meeting, Mr. Wen openly agreed with these three pro-consumption initiatives. My hope is that such measures will be featured prominently in China's 12th five-year plan, for 2011-2016, because they could provide an important impetus to Chinese employment, personal income and consumer purchasing power.
That would be a win-win for China and the broader global economy. After all, the import share of China's G.D.P. is quite high -- 28.5 percent in 2008, a figure that suggests the Chinese are predisposed to buy foreign goods. Any increase in Chinese consumption would therefore offer a potentially powerful opportunity for American-made goods and services.
China bashers are blind to these critical points. No nation has ever devalued its way to prosperity. A weaker dollar, or the mirror image of a stronger renminbi, would be no exception to that time-honored premise. America's own economic miracle has long been defined by our ability to meet competitive challenges head on. And a China that starts to consume more would offer us precisely the opportunity we need to rise to that challenge again.
The Chinese leadership must now make the urgent choice about how to best deal with political and economic pressures coming from the United States and others. Congress has opted for the low road of misdirected currency bashing. China should take the high road by providing immediate and long-overdue stimulus to private consumption.

Full text: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan -- The Pakistani military, angered by the inept handling of the country's devastating floods and alarmed by a collapse of the economy, is pushing for a shake-up of the elected government, and in the longer term, even the removal of President Asif Ali Zardari and his top lieutenants.
The military, preoccupied by a war against militants and reluctant to assume direct responsibility for the economic crisis, has made clear it is not eager to take over the government, as it has many times before, military officials and politicians said.
But the government's performance since the floods, which have left 20 million people homeless and the nation dependent on handouts from skeptical foreign donors, has laid bare the deep underlying tensions between military and civilian leaders.
American officials, too, say it has left them increasingly disillusioned with Mr. Zardari, a deeply unpopular president who was elected two and a half years ago on a wave of sympathy after the assassination of his wife, former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.
In a meeting on Monday that was played on the front page of Pakistan's newspapers, the army chief, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, confronted the president and his prime minister, Yousaf Raza Gilani, over incompetence and corruption in the government.
According to the press and Pakistani officials familiar with the conversation, the general demanded that they dismiss at least some ministers in the oversized 60-member cabinet, many of whom face corruption charges.
The civilian government has so far resisted the general's demand. But the meeting was widely interpreted by the Pakistani news media, which has grown increasingly hostile to the president, as a rebuke to the civilian politicians and as having pushed the government to the brink.
After the meeting, the president's office issued a statement, approved by all the men, saying they had agreed "to protect the democratic process and to resolve all issues in accordance with the constitution."
A Pakistani official close to the president who was familiar with the conversation but did not want to be identified, said, "The president made it clear that he would not leave, come what may."
"Sanity had prevailed," the official added.
Since the floods, the government has defended its handling of the crisis, arguing that any government would have been overwhelmed by its scale.
Still, it is clear that General Kayani, head of the country's most powerful institution, and the one that has taken the lead in the flood crisis, has ratcheted up the pressure on the government.
Having secured an exceptional three-year extension in his post from Mr. Zardari in July, General Kayani appears determined to prevent the economy from bankruptcy. Military officers in the main cities have been talking openly and expansively about their contempt for the Zardari government and what they term the economic calamity, an unusual candor, reporters and politicians said.
"The gross economic mismanagement by the government is at the heart of it," said Rifaat Hussain, a professor of international relations at Islamabad University and a confidant of the military. "And there is the rising public disaffection with the Pakistani Peoples Party under Zardari and Gilani."
As the military demands the overhaul, the Supreme Court is also pushing the government on the issue of corruption by threatening to remove the president's immunity from prosecution, a move that would expose him to charges of corruption in an old money-laundering case in Switzerland.
The government has defied the court's demand to write a letter to the Swiss government requesting a reopening of the case against Mr. Zardari, who served 11 years in prison in Pakistan on unproved corruption charges. On Monday, the court granted an extension of two weeks for the government to reconsider its position.
Much of the rising disdain for the government has to do with the perception among the media and the public of the callous and inept handling of the floods by the nation's wealthy ruling class.
Mr. Gilani drew public ire for appearing at an ersatz camp for flood victims set up just for television cameras. It also did not help that newspapers reported that scores of cartons from the London luxury store Harrods had arrived at his residence in Lahore at the height of the flooding.
Mr. Zardari, meanwhile, was vilified for visiting his chateau in France as torrents of water wiped out millions of villagers in his home province, Sindh.
In his most recent visit to Pakistan, Richard C. Holbrooke, the American special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, said the international community could not be expected to provide all the billions of dollars needed to repair the flood damage, a warning interpreted here as a rebuke of the civilian government and its mismanagement.
But Washington, not unlike Pakistan's military, is caught, American officials say, because there is no appetite for a return of military rule. Nor is there desire to see the opposition politician and former prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, resume power.
Mr. Sharif, who has also faced corruption charges during his career, is considered by Washington to be too close to some of Pakistan's militant groups, whose members vote in Punjab, the Sharif electoral base.
As the head of the of the main opposition party, the Pakistan Muslim League-N, Mr. Sharif is not ready to come to the fore in any case, his aides say, because he does not want to be associated with the paralysis of the current government.
Of mounting concern to the Obama administration is the potential for serious unrest if the economy unspools further: inflation by some predictions will reach 25 percent in the coming period. The price of sugar has tripled, and the cost of flour has doubled since the Zardari government came to power.
In particular, Washington wants the government to raise taxes on the wealthy landed and commercial class, a shortcoming that has become especially galling as Pakistan's dependence on foreign donors rises.
Pakistan's revenues from taxes are among the lowest in the world: only 2 million Pakistanis of a population of 170 million pay income tax, according to estimates by the United States.
A report in a leading newspaper, The News, said Monday that Mr. Gilani and 25 of his ministers, including the finance minister, Hafiz Shaikh, did not pay income taxes at all, according to sworn affidavits by the ministers to the Election Commission of Pakistan.
The alarm about the economy was first sounded by Mr. Shaikh, a former officer of the World Bank, who told a meeting of political and military leaders last month that the government had enough money to pay only two months' salaries. The economy was "teetering on the brink" before the floods but was now heading for the "abyss," Mr. Shaikh was quoted as saying.
The military officers who attended were astounded, Mr. Hussain and others informed of the meeting said, and have pressed the government for changes, politicians and diplomats said.
As the military maneuvers for change, it is not immune from criticism. Defense spending is budgeted at 13.6 percent of total expenditures in 2011, in line with past yearly expenditures even as the civilian population suffers.
The defense budget remains beyond public scrutiny, a fact that increasingly irks the public.
"Do we even know how much it costs taxpayers each year to make possible the office, the home, the car fleets, attendants, guest houses and other amenities that are enjoyed by the army chief or even a corps commander?" asked Babar Sattar, a lawyer who often writes about corruption.

Abstract: Last Friday, Mr. Obama personally raised the issue with the Chinese premier, Wen Jiabao, on the sidelines of the United NationsGeneral Assembly meetings in New York. Since June, when China announced that it would permit greater exchange-rate flexibility, the renminbi has risen less than 2 percent against the dollar, with much of the increase occurring this month, amid rising Congressional anger and tough new rhetoric from the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The House is expected to give the Obama administration another tool in its diplomatic pouch to pressure China to let its currency rise in value, reflecting growing concern around the country over the loss of manufacturing jobs, persistently high unemployment and a rising trade deficit.
In what is likely to be one of Congress's last significant measures before the election, the House will vote Wednesday on a symbolic but not insignificant measure threatening China with punitive tariffs on its imports to the United States.
In the past, Beijing has responded to such tactics by allowing its currency to rise gradually in relation to the dollar. Lately, though, efforts at cajoling the Chinese to revalue their currency have met with little, if any, response.
But it is unclear whether the legislation, which faces cloudy prospects in the Senate, will succeed this time in prodding a China that has become more self-confident on the world stage. Some economists believe that Beijing has undervalued the currency, the renminbi, for about a decade to promote Chinese exports by making them cheaper.
"The legislation will strengthen the administration's hand in its negotiations with China, but also risks provoking a strong backlash," said Eswar S. Prasad, a professor of trade policy at Cornell and a former head of the International Monetary Fund's China division. "Ultimately its short-term effect is likely to be more symbolic than substantive."
The strategy has borne fruit before. In July 2005, under pressure from a Republican-controlled Congress and the Bush administration, Chinese officials agreed to end the fixed peg of the renminbi to the dollar, allowing it to appreciate by more than 20 percent until July 2008, when they re-established the peg in response to global economic turmoil.
Now, with Democrats struggling to maintain their Congressional majorities, a Democratic president is pressing China on the issue. But so far the efforts have yielded little.
Lawrence H. Summers, one of President Obama's top economic advisers, and Thomas E. Donilon, deputy national security adviser, traveled to Beijing this month for three days of meetings with Chinese leaders but returned empty-handed on the currency issue.
Last Friday, Mr. Obama personally raised the issue with the Chinese premier, Wen Jiabao, on the sidelines of the United NationsGeneral Assembly meetings in New York.
Since June, when China announced that it would permit greater exchange-rate flexibility, the renminbi has risen less than 2 percent against the dollar, with much of the increase occurring this month, amid rising Congressional anger and tough new rhetoric from the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner.
A weaker renminbi -- estimates of the extent of the undervaluation range as high as 40 percent -- makes Chinese exports cheaper and foreign imports more expensive.
But in both countries, there are constituencies for and against currency revaluation.
In the United States, smaller manufacturers, labor unions and agricultural producers have been pressing the government to take a tough stance, saying that the currency policy has contributed to soaring trade deficits and the continued erosion of domestic industry.
But large multinational corporations, especially those with production plants in China, and Wall Street banks, are comfortable with a weak renminbi because they export goods from China or are trying to promote investment there.
In China, consumers would benefit from cheaper imports, and a stronger renminbi would help correct global economic imbalances that some economists say could lead to soaring inflation and asset bubbles. But export-oriented businesses and state-owned companies, which wield tremendous clout within the Communist regime, say the weak currency is vital for economic growth.
In recent weeks, the Obama administration, which had favored quiet diplomacy, has signaled to Congress that it was open to new measures.
Though he did not endorse the legislation, Mr. Geithner said at a House hearing this month that "it is very important that China hear from the Congress, from Republicans and from Democrats," about the effect of China's policies on American economic interests.
The Ways and Means Committee passed the bill on a voice vote on Friday.
Sponsored by Representatives Tim Ryan, Democrat of Ohio, and Tim Murphy, Republican of Pennsylvania, the legislation would expand the Commerce Department's ability to impose punitive duties on countries that undervalue their currencies to promote exports.
Experts expressed skepticism about the move; some believe it will merely antagonize the Chinese.
"Many people don't think the multilateral steps have worked, that they've been tried, the talk has gone on, and nothing has happened," Ira S. Shapiro, a lawyer at Greenberg Traurig and a top trade negotiator during the Clinton administration, told House members this month. "I think it's too early to reach that conclusion."
Mr. Shapiro urged American officials to make the upcoming Group of 20 summit meeting in Seoul, South Korea, in November the focal point of multinational efforts to persuade China to move. If those talks fail, he said, the United States should pursue remedies at the World Trade Organization, which China joined in 2001.
Professor Prasad of Cornell warned that if the Congressional proposal went forward, China could retaliate by limiting American imports or denying American manufacturers and financial institutions "the coveted prize of access to rapidly growing Chinese markets."
Framing the issue as a dispute between the two countries, he added, "suits the Chinese well as it deflects attention from the global consequences of Chinese currency policy."
Many economists believe that China is unlikely to budge without a concerted demonstration of international resolve. But such coordination is difficult when all countries are struggling to bolster their recoveries.
Two weeks ago, Japan devalued the yen, its first intervention in currency markets since 2004. The finance minister of Brazil, whose currency has soared in value, warned Tuesday that an "international currency war" was under way.
The International Monetary Fund has affirmed that China undervalues its currency, but lacks enforcement powers to give teeth to its reports. And the process for resolving disputes through the World Trade Organization is lengthy and uncertain.
All of those factors have made action by the House increasingly likely.

Full text: September consumer confidence in the United States slipped to its lowest levels since February, driven by a deteriorating labor market and business conditions, according to a private report released Tuesday.
The Conference Board, an industry group, said its index of consumer attitudes fell to 48.5 points in September, from a revised 53.2 in August.
Inflation expectations eased slightly, even after the Federal Reserve said it was ready to take action to keep yields down in an effort to stimulate growth. Consumers' one-year inflation expectations edged down to 4.9 percent, from 5.0 percent the previous month.
The median of forecasts from analysts polled by Reuters was for an overall September reading of 52.5. Forecasts ranged from 48.0 to 55.0.
The August reading was revised down slightly from an original 53.5.
The expectations index slipped to 65.4 from 72.0 last month, and the present situation index slipped to 23.1 from 24.9 in August.
Consumers' labor market assessment also worsened. Those who said jobs were "hard to get" rose to 46.1 percent from 45.5 percent, while the share that described jobs as "plentiful" decreased to 3.8 percent from 4 percent.
Also, single-family home prices fell in July, and were seen stabilizing near the lows without the homebuyer tax credit that ended in April, the Standard & Poor's/Case-Shillerhome price indexes showed Tuesday.
The composite index of 20 metropolitan areas declined 0.1 percent in July from June on a seasonally adjusted basis, as expected in a Reuters poll. The dip followed a 0.2 percent June rise, which was revised down from a 0.3 percent increase.
Unadjusted, the 20-city index gained 0.6 percent after June's 1 percent gain. A 0.4 percent rise was expected.
Home prices in the 20 cities index rose 3.2 percent from July 2009, a slower annual pace than the 4.2 percent increased in June, the index reported.
Ten of the cities had annual gains, and only Las Vegas set a new low, as the impact of the homebuyer tax credit faded away, S.& P. said. But the year-over-year growth rates slowed in 16 of the cities and both the 10- and 20-city composite indexes in July from the previous month.
"While we could still see some residual support from the homebuyers' tax credit, which covers purchases closing through Sept. 30th, anyone looking for home prices to return to the lofty 2005-2006 levels might be disappointed," David M. Blitzer, chairman of the index committee at S.& P., said in a statement.

Full text: Extravagant promises and bluster are the stuff of campaign rhetoric, but the House Republicans' "Pledge to America" goes far beyond the norm.
Its breathless mimicry of the Declaration of Independence -- the "governed do not consent," it declares, while vowing to rein in "an arrogant and out-of-touch government of self-appointed elites" -- would be ludicrous, if these were not destructively polarized times.
While it promises to create jobs, control deficit spending and restore Americans' trust in government, it is devoid of tough policy choices. This new "governing agenda" does not say how the Republicans would replace revenue that would be lost from permanently extending all of the Bush tax cuts, or how they would manage Medicare and Social Security, or even which discretionary programs would go when they slash $100 billion in spending. Their record at all of these things is dismal.
The best way to understand the pledge is as a bid to co-opt the Tea Party by a Republican leadership that wants to sound insurrectionist but is the same old Washington elite. These are the folks who slashed taxes on the rich, turned a surplus into a crushing deficit, and helped unleash the financial crisis that has thrown millions of Americans out of their jobs and their homes.
Not only are the players the same, the policies are the same. Just more tax cuts for the rich and more deficit spending. We find it hard to believe that even the most disaffected voters will be taken in. But again, these are strange and worrying times.
Still, the pledge was worth a careful reading. It is a reminder that there is a choice to be made this fall.
THE BUDGET DEFICIT The Republicans' central claim is that they will be able to reduce the budget deficit, while cutting taxes deeply and making marginal cuts in spending. That pledge is impossible to keep. There is no chance of reducing the deficit without tax increases. The budget has been chronically short of revenue since the start of the Bush-era tax cuts, and more indiscriminate cutting will only dig the hole deeper.
Cutting the deficit will also require curbs on the government's biggest and most popular entitlement programs -- Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, collectively 40 percent of the budget. Ditto military spending, another 20 percent. Yet Republicans pledge to shield seniors, veterans and the troops from spending cuts.
It is difficult to put an exact number on the size of the deficits and debt implied by the pledge, because the details are sketchy. What is known is that if current tax and spending policies continue, the deficit (currently estimated at $1.3 trillion) will double in size as a share of the economy in the decades to come.
TAXES AND TAX CUTS The Republicans' pledge also fails to mention that President Obama has already called for extending the tax cuts for 98 percent of taxpayers (couples making up to $250,000 and individuals making up to $200,000).
So what the pledge is really advocating is a permanent extension of tax cuts for the top 2 percent. In all, the pledge's tax proposal would add $3.7 trillion to the nation's debt over the next 10 years, nearly $700 billion more than the administration's proposal.
The drive for permanent high-end tax cuts is profligate; there is no other word for it. The nation cannot afford it. We are fighting a war in Afghanistan and only now winding down the war in Iraq. The baby boom generation is about to retire. To keep competing, the country needs enormous investment in infrastructure, energy alternatives, education and basic research.
The pledge asserts that letting the high-end tax cuts expire would kill job creation. With the economy weak, letting all the tax cuts expire would be a big hit to consumer spending and, by extension, job growth. But richer Americans tend to save, not spend, their tax cuts. Of 11 ways to boost the economy analyzed by the Congressional Budget Office, preserving the high-end tax cuts ranked last.
Republicans also assert that letting the high-end cuts expire would devastate small businesses. But less than 3 percent of taxpayers with business income would be affected. Republicans claim that 50 percent of small-business income would be hit. The only way to get that number is by including "small businesses" like some major law firms, investment funds, actors and athletes -- hardly Main Street.
In any case, business owners do not typically base their hiring decisions on their income tax rate. If the top tax rates reverted to the pre-Bush levels, wealthy owners would keep less of the additional profit. But if a hire is profitable before tax, it will be profitable after tax. Undeterred by facts, the pledge would let small-business owners deduct 20 percent of their business income. Given the Republicans' broad definition, that implies another big tax cut -- an estimated $25 billion over two years -- flowing to many high earners.
SPENDING The Republicans' document promises the American people a "fact based" discussion of the scale of the nation's budget problems. Then it offers a laundry list of spending-cut proposals, none of which are up to the scale of the problem, and many that cannot be taken seriously.
Calling the $862 billion stimulus wasteful and unnecessary, it says Congress should immediately cancel any unspent funds. Never mind that the stimulus, while too small given the depth of the crisis, still prevented a bad recession from being much worse.
There is also not much to cancel. Of roughly $260 billion left, contracts have already been signed for $150 billion. Another $45 billion is tax cuts that will soon be claimed, and $33 billion is for safety-net spending, like food stamps. That leaves $31 billion in investment projects -- like roads and rail systems -- still up for grabs. At a time when the private sector is not creating enough jobs, canceling them would be a mistake.
The House Republicans also promise to roll back spending, saving $100 billion in the first year alone. There are no details, but the proposal appears to reflect an earlier Republican proposal to cut programs like education, food safety and environmental protection.
Even in the best of times, it would be disastrous to slash such vital programs. Right now, it would also remove purchasing power, cost jobs and heighten the risk of a prolonged downturn.
The Republicans also say they will save taxpayers $30 billion by ending the government takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. A serious debate on the future of the huge mortgage companies needs to take place. Currently, however, they own or back most new mortgages. Cutting them loose too soon would risk further damage to the wounded housing market.
Then there is the bank bailout, or TARP, the Troubled Asset Relief Program. which the pledge vows to end "once and for all," for a savings of $16 billion. What it does not say is that new TARP spending was basically outlawed in the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill passed in July.
HEALTH CARE REFORM The Republican plan to "repeal and replace" the new reform law is set forth in a skimpy chapter that fails to offer any real alternative to cover uninsured Americans or reduce medical inflation.
The pledge contains a few golden G.O.P. oldies: medical liability reform that will probably not save serious money; allowing Americans to purchase insurance issued in other states, which could bring down premiums for the healthy while driving them up for the chronically ill; and expanding so-called health savings accounts that are useful for some Americans but not all.
At the same time as they revile reform, the authors embrace, or at least pretend to, some of the most popular, consumer-friendly features of the law, like eliminating spending caps and prohibitions against dropping your coverage just because you get sick. The Republicans say they would provide incentives to states to develop innovative reforms; that, too, is already in the law.
The pledge document does not mention the Republicans' plan -- should repeal fail -- to block the annual appropriations needed to carry out reform. That just-say-no approach is flat-out irresponsible. The health care reforms are so intertwined that it is hard to eliminate one provision without undermining others.

Americans are right to be worried and even angry about the bad economy. And they are right to demand that Washington do a lot more to revive employment now and start to reduce the deficit soon. But these are hard problems built up over eight years of mainly Republican leadership. The pledge takes the country backward -- a place no one should want to go.

Abstract: More than 100 House Democrats, including leaders of the Congressional Black Caucus and the Congressional Progressive Caucus, have signed a letter to Speaker Nancy Pelosi opposing the use of food stamp money to pay for the expansion of child nutrition programs. By reducing future food stamp benefits, Mr. Bloomberg said, the Senate bill "would reduce the availability of nutritious food at children's homes in order to provide those very same children nutritious options at school."

Full text: WASHINGTON -- In her campaign to reduce childhood obesity and improve school nutrition, Michelle Obama has become entangled in a fight with White House allies, including liberal Democrats and advocates for the poor.
At issue is how to pay for additional spending on the school lunch program and other child nutrition projects eagerly sought by the White House. A bill that the House is expected to consider within days would come up with some of the money by cutting future food stamp benefits.
When the Senate passed the bill in early August, Mrs. Obama said she was thrilled. But anti-hunger groups were not. They deluged House members on Thursday with phone calls and e-mails expressing alarm.
"It is wrong to take money from food stamps to finance child nutrition programs," said Edward M. Cooney, executive director of the Congressional Hunger Center, an advocacy group. "You are taking money from low-income people in one program and spending it on low-income people -- maybe the same people -- in another program."
The Food Research and Action Center and Catholic Charities USA said they supported expanding child nutrition programs but opposed cutting money for food stamps, now known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.
More than 100 House Democrats, including leaders of the Congressional Black Caucus and the Congressional Progressive Caucus, have signed a letter to Speaker Nancy Pelosi opposing the use of food stamp money to pay for the expansion of child nutrition programs. Labor unions, including the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and the National Education Association, and women's groups have sent similar letters.
Administration officials are pushing House Democrats to pass the Senate bill. The House Democratic whip, James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, sent an e-mail to colleagues this week asking if they supported it.
House Democratic leaders said the House could consider the Senate bill under an expedited procedure that prohibits amendments and requires a two-thirds majority for passage.
Martha B. Coven, a senior staff member at the White House Domestic Policy Council, said the bill "would make a historic investment in school meal programs and go a long way toward achieving Mrs. Obama's goal of ending the epidemic of childhood obesity in a generation."
"We support the bill as a whole," Ms. Coven said. "We strongly support House passage of the Senate bill." She declined to comment on criticism of the food stamp changes.
Lawmakers from both parties and child nutrition advocates have praised many provisions of the Senate bill. It gives the secretary of agriculture the authority to establish nutrition standards for foods sold in schools during the school day, including vending machine items. And it would require schools to serve more fruits and vegetables, whole grains and low-fat dairy products.
Also, for the first time in over three decades, it would increase federal reimbursement for school lunches beyond inflation -- to allow for the cost of higher-quality meals. It would also allow more than 100,000 children on Medicaid to qualify for free school meals, without filing applications.
Representative Jim McGovern, Democrat of Massachusetts, said: "I want to pass a child nutrition bill. I am committed to the first lady's campaign. I want to be helpful. But I won't vote for a bill that robs Peter to pay Paul. The White House needs to work with us to find a better way to offset the cost."
Representative Barbara Lee, Democrat of California and chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, said, "While I want a strong and robust reauthorization of the Child Nutrition Act, we cannot do it on the backs of the unemployed, underemployed and chronically poor."
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York City weighed in too. He wrote that he was concerned about the health and welfare of the more than one million students in the city's public schools. But he said that Congress should not try to help them at the expense of food stamp recipients.
By reducing future food stamp benefits, Mr. Bloomberg said, the Senate bill "would reduce the availability of nutritious food at children's homes in order to provide those very same children nutritious options at school."
Nationwide, more than 41 million people receive food stamps, nearly half of them children. The number of recipients has increased 51 percent since the recession began in December 2007. The average monthly benefit is $133 a person, about $4.40 a day.
The Senate bill would save $2.2 billion over 10 years by eliminating an increase in benefits provided by the 2009 economic stimulus law. Food price inflation has been lower than expected, so the increase could be ended early, in November 2013, proponents say.
Ellen S. Teller of the Food Research and Action Center said the cuts "would increase poverty and could increase obesity because shoppers would try to stretch their dollars by buying cheaper, calorie-dense food that has low nutritional value."

Full text: The following is the full text of the statement released Tuesday by the Federal Reserve:
Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in August indicates that the pace of recovery in output and employment has slowed in recent months. Household spending is increasing gradually, but remains constrained by high unemployment, modest income growth, lower housing wealth, and tight credit. Business spending on equipment and software is rising, though less rapidly than earlier in the year, while investment in nonresidential structures continues to be weak. Employers remain reluctant to add to payrolls. Housing starts are at a depressed level. Bank lending has continued to contract, but at a reduced rate in recent months. The committee anticipates a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization in a context of price stability, although the pace of economic recovery is likely to be modest in the near term.
Measures of underlying inflation are currently at levels somewhat below those the committee judges most consistent, over the longer run, with its mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability. With substantial resource slack continuing to restrain cost pressures and longer-term inflation expectations stable, inflation is likely to remain subdued for some time before rising to levels the committee considers consistent with its mandate.
The committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate for an extended period. The committee also will maintain its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its securities holdings.
The committee will continue to monitor the economic outlook and financial developments and is prepared to provide additional accommodation if needed to support the economic recovery and to return inflation, over time, to levels consistent with its mandate.
Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Ben S. Bernanke, chairman; William C. Dudley, vice chairman; James Bullard; Elizabeth A. Duke; Sandra Pianalto; Eric S. Rosengren; Daniel K. Tarullo; and Kevin M. Warsh.
Voting against the policy was Thomas M. Hoenig, who judged that the economy continues to recover at a moderate pace. Accordingly, he believed that continuing to express the expectation of exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period was no longer warranted and will lead to future imbalances that undermine stable long-run growth. In addition, given economic and financial conditions, Mr. Hoenig did not believe that continuing to reinvest principal payments from its securities holdings was required to support the committee's policy objectives.

Full text: Citizens for the Republic, a conservative grass-roots lobbying group, plans to release a stark, one-minute ad on Wednesday called "Mourning in America," a play on the 1984 ad for Ronald Reagan, "Morning in America."
"There's mourning in America," the new spot begins, as dreary images of unemployed workers and dilapidated buildings glide by. "Today, 15 million men and women won't have the opportunity to go to work, business is shuttered, 2,900 families will have their homes foreclosed by nightfall."
The ad is a blunt, almost point-by-point comparison to the hopeful, optimistic spot from Reagan's re-election year. "Morning in America" promoted the future, noting, "This afternoon, 6,500 young men and women will be married and with inflation at less than half of what it was just four years ago, they can look forward with confidence to the future." This week's spot offers a grim contrast: "This afternoon, 6,000 men and women will be married, each of their children to be born with a $30,000 share of the runaway national debt."
People familiar with the buy say the citizens group, which Reagan started in 1977 as a political action committee, is spending hundreds of thousands of dollars to put the ad on national cable channels for one week.
"It's morning again in America," the Reagan ad concludes, as the Capitol glistens against a night sky and people raise American flags up flagpoles. "And under the leadership of President Reagan, our country is prouder and stronger and better."
The new spot ends with distinctly different adjectives.
"There's mourning in America," a narrator intones. "Under the leadership of President Obama, our country is fading and weaker and worse off. His policies were a grand experiment, policies that failed. This November, let's choose a smaller, more caring government, one that remembers us."
The organization is hoping that their spot could be a breakout ad for this election cycle, and they enlisted the help of Fred Davis, a Republican media consultant who was behind the now infamous Carly Fiorina "Demon Sheep" ad.
"They wanted something that could be a big umbrella message for what malaise is in the country," Mr. Davis said. "They came to me and basically said, 'We're not happy with the way things are going in the country, and what can we do that has the potential to be a game changer?' "
Mr. Davis said he kept coming back to Reagan's 1984 commercial - an ad he said he liked for its elegant simplicity- and submitted a version of "Morning in America" to the citizens group. It then added the extra vowel, transforming it to "Mourning."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text: Shares on Wall Street got a brief bump on Tuesday after word that the Federal Reserve was ready to do more to help the economy, but indexes ended mostly lower after the central bank disappointed some investors by not taking any bold new actions.
Treasury prices rallied as investors saw the Fed's announcement as a signal that more bond purchases were on the way.
The Fed said it was concerned that inflation was below levels consistent with a healthy economy and indicated that it was ready to provide "additional accommodation" to support the recovery. That would mean more purchases of Treasuries or other kinds of debt, which would keep interest rates low in a bid to encourage borrowing.
"They left themselves as much room as they possibly could," said E. William Stone, chief investment strategist at PNC Wealth Management. "In the bond world, the coast is clear for buyers."
Treasuries rose sharply after the Fed's announcement, sending interest rates lower. The price on the 10-year Treasury note rose 1 4/32, to 100 14/32, while the yield fell sharply, to 2.57 percent from 2.70 percent late Monday. The yield is a common benchmark for setting interest rates on corporate debt and mortgages.
The Fed's statement, which came after a one-day meeting of its interest rate committee, had only a temporary effect on stocks. Hopes had been building that the Fed would announce a new bond-purchasing program.
Shares had been trading lower ahead of the Fed's announcement and rallied briefly after the news came out. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped nearly 80 points after the announcement.
But a late slump erased most of the day's advances. The Dow rose 7.41 points, or 0.07 percent, to close at 10,761.03. It is still up 7.5 percent for September.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 2.93 points, or 0.26 percent, to 1,139.78, while the Nasdaq composite index fell 6.48 points, or 0.28 percent, to 2,349.35.
The weakness in broader indexes suggested that a three-week rally on the stock market might be losing steam as stocks started to seem expensive. The S.& P. 500 is still up 8.6 percent for the month, an extraordinarily strong showing for September, while the Nasdaq is up 11.1 percent.
Tom Porcelli, head of United States market economics at the Royal Bank of Canada, said there was now a good chance that the Fed would decide to add more debt to its books at the next meeting of its rate-setting committee on Nov. 2.
But another round of bond buying by the Fed may offer the economy little help, he argued. The last round of Fed purchases had the effect of lowering lending rates by a half a percentage point.
Now, a move by the Fed would probably have less impact. Interest rates are low but borrowing is still weak. "The fact remains that the economic backdrop is the driver of lending, not low rates," Mr. Porcelli wrote in a note to clients after the announcement.
In corporate news, steep discounts and higher costs drove fiscal first-quarter profit lower at ConAgra Foods. Shares of the company, which owns the Chef Boyardee and Peter Pan brands, fell 80 cents, or 3.6 percent, to close at $21.57.
The cruise line operator Carnival Corporation reported a 22 percent jump in quarterly profit as demand was strong during the summer. It also raised its full-year earnings outlook well above analysts' forecasts. The company's stock rose 51 cents, to $37.57.
The dollar fell against other major currencies. Gold prices continued to hover near record highs, trading up $8.80, to $1,287.15 an ounce.
Falling stocks outnumbered rising ones two to one on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to one billion shares.

Abstract: Officials at the Federal Reserve signaled on Tuesday for the first time that they were worried that the slow-moving economic recovery could be undermined by very low rates of inflation, and hinted strongly that it might resume buying vast amounts of government debt to spur the recovery. While the central bank's Federal Open Market Committee did not take any new steps on interest rates, it communicated in unmistakable terms its concerns about the fragility of the economic recovery and a threat to stable prices.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Officials at the Federal Reserve signaled on Tuesday for the first time that they were worried that the slow-moving economic recovery could be undermined by very low rates of inflation, and hinted strongly that it might resume buying vast amounts of government debt to spur the recovery. While the central bank's Federal Open Market Committee did not take any new steps on interest rates, it communicated in unmistakable terms its concerns about the fragility of the economic recovery and a threat to stable prices.
It said that underlying inflation levels, which have hovered at about half the Fed's 2 percent target rate, were "somewhat below those the committee judges most consistent, over the longer run, with its mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability."
That was a departure from just six weeks ago when the committee commented that inflation measures had "trended lower in recent quarters." The concern over low inflation has raised fears of deflation -- a sustained drop in wages and prices.
Last month, the Fed said it was "prepared to provide additional accommodation if needed" to support the recovery and get inflation back to normal.
For now, the Fed took no such action. It will continue to maintain its portfolio of securities by reinvesting the proceeds from its holdings of mortgage-related bonds to buy long-term Treasury debt, the tactic it announced on Aug. 10. That strategy was intended to prevent the possibility of a slight tightening of monetary policy that would have occurred as bonds held by the Fed were paid off and money was taken out of the economy.
On Tuesday the Fed's policy-making committee did what most market analysts expected; it deferred the decision on whether it should begin a big new push to speed the recovery by creating money for large-scale purchases of Treasury securities, a strategy known as quantitative easing. Such easing would push down long-term interest rates, which could help reduce the already low cost of borrowing.
"They can't say unequivocally that we're going into another recession, but they certainly can't promise a rapid recovery," said Michael D. Bordo, an economist at Rutgers University and an authority on monetary policy. "They're in this limbo state."
Moments after the central bank announced its decision, stock prices, which had been flat most of the day, rose with the Dow increasing as much as 80 points. But some investors wanted the Fed to take bolder steps and the rally fizzled. The Dow ended the day up 7.41 points.
Last March, the Fed completed a big round of quantitative easing after buying $1.4 trillion in mortgage-related securities and $300 billion in Treasury debt in the space of 15 months.
In a speech on Aug. 27, at the Fed's annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyo., the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, left no doubt that a big new round of quantitative easing was one option if the recovery needed a lift. Other options include signaling that the Fed intends to keep rates low for even longer than markets already expect, or lowering the interest paid on reserves that banks hold at the Fed -- a step that could encourage banks to lend more.
"The committee put a marker down in August," said Ellen E. Meade, an economist at American University who studies Fed decision-making. "They want to keep it out there, but they don't want to use it just yet. They opened the door on quantitative easing, and they're keeping it open until they're sure they need to close it."
Angel Gurria, secretary-general of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, said, "The Fed needs to be vigilant but doesn't necessarily need to restart the program at this stage."
He added: "We need to know if this is a short-term weakness or if it has longer staying power. We believe it is more likely that the weakness is temporary and that we will probably recover from this recent bump. It's a pothole, not a ditch."
The committee began its meeting on Tuesday at 8 a.m., an hour earlier than usual, to leave plenty of time for discussion in an acknowledgment of the Fed's uncertainty.
Though the recession officially ended in June 2009, as the academic arbiters of the nation's business cycles announced Monday, the 9.6 percent unemployment rate shows no signs of improvement.
"On balance, has the economy been worsening since Jackson Hole? Probably not," Professor Meade said. "Have there been a few signs that things have gotten better? Maybe. The urgency that seemed to be on the margins in August may have lessened, and that's the argument for waiting."
While the Fed tries to operate outside of political cycles, the fact that this was the last scheduled policy meeting before the midterm elections cannot have escaped its members' notice. The committee is next scheduled to gather for a two-day meeting on Nov. 2 -- Election Day -- and Nov. 3.
"All else equal, if they can postpone action until after the midterm election, they would prefer to do that," said Jonathan H. Wright, an economist at Johns Hopkins University and a former Fed researcher.
There is a growing expectation among Wall Street economists that the Fed will resume quantitative easing later this year, either at the November meeting or at the committee's final meeting this year, on Dec. 14. Of course, the forecasters have been known to err.
"I think there's a big split within the committee," Professor Wright said. "To get the F.O.M.C. to really do any of the remaining options that they have open to them, it would take some really clear signal of the economic outlook worsening."
To no one's surprise, the Fed on Tuesday left the benchmark short-term interest rate -- the federal funds rate, at which banks lend to each overnight -- at near zero, its level since December 2008, and reiterated that the rate would likely remain "exceptionally low" for "an extended period," the wording it has consistently used since March 2009.
And equally expectedly, Thomas M. Hoenig, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, was the lone dissenter in the committee's 8 to 1 vote. He has objected at every committee meeting this year to the Fed's language on keeping short rates low, and he also opposed the decision made in August to reinvest proceeds from mortgage-related securities in new purchases of government debt.
The Tuesday meeting was unusual in one respect. There were only nine officials voting, not the normal 12. That was because the Fed's seven-member board of governors now has three vacancies, after the retirement of Donald L. Kohn on Sept. 1.
President Obama has nominated three people to fill the seats, but the Senate has not yet confirmed them. Along with the seven governors, the committee includes the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and a rotating group of four other regional Fed presidents.

Full text: Beijing
Spend enough time with Chinese officials and economists, and you will hear a story about the Japanese yen in the 1980s.
Back then, Americans were upset about Japanese imports flowing into the country, just as they are upset about Chinese imports today. So the United States pushed Japan to let the yen appreciate, thereby making Japanese imports more expensive and American exports to Japan cheaper. Tokyo complied, and the yen surged almost 50 percent from 1985 to 1987.
Yet the imports kept coming. The trade deficit with Japan actually widened to $108 billion in 1987, from $94 billion in 1985. The rising yen wasn't enough to halt the growth of companies like Sony and Toyota. They had too many advantages, including lower labor costs.
The moral of the story, in the Chinese telling, is that even a sharp rise in China's renminbi won't necessarily do much to help the American economy. "Renminbi appreciation may not have a big impact," Fan Gang, an economist and former government adviser, said last week at a meeting here with American economists and policy makers, "or an impact at all."
And it's true that a stronger renminbi would not be a quick fix for our economic problems, as appealing a notion as that might be. The yen isn't the only parallel here. The renminbi itself rose 21 percent against the dollar from 2005 to 2008, and the trade deficit continued to widen.
But there is also no question that China's currency remains undervalued, probably by 20 percent or so. The economics are simple enough. The huge demand for Chinese goods should be driving up the price of its currency, but Beijing has been intervening to prevent that. Getting China to stop will be crucial to correcting the global economy's imbalances. A stronger renminbi will help China's people -- many of whom are hungry for better living standards, to judge by the recent labor strikes -- buy more goods and services, and it will also help the rest of world produce more. But change is not going to happen overnight.
China's Communist Party has had a very good 20-year run by making incremental changes and then watching the benefits accumulate over time. Realistically, that may be the best we can hope for with the renminbi.
It also happens to be the ultimate moral of the story about the yen -- even if Chinese officials tend to leave that part out.

A big change in an exchange rate seems at first glance that it should have an immediate impact. Certainly, it has some impact. The 1980s trade deficit with Japan would have grown even more rapidly had the yen not risen.
But there are two main reasons that a stronger renminbi probably will not lead to a rapid hiring increase in the United States.
The first is that China and United States aren't the only two countries in the world. Many products that we think of as being made in China, like the iPhone, are really just assembled in China. High-end parts often come from richer countries, like Israel or South Korea. Basic parts can be made in poorer countries, like Vietnam.
The entire value of the product counts toward the trade deficit between the United States and China. A stronger renminbi, however, would affect only the portion of the work done in China. And if the renminbi rose enough, some of this work would simply shift to a country like Vietnam (where per capita income is about $3,000, compared with $6,500 in China). Such a shift wouldn't help close our overall trade deficit.
Chinese officials sometimes go so far as to suggest that the value of the renminbi makes little difference. That's wrong. China's economy is now large enough that its currency matters. But the issue is more complicated than it first seems.
The second reason not to view the exchange rate as a cure-all is that economies, like battleships, tend to turn slowly. Companies rarely move production in a matter of weeks. If they are using a Chinese supplier, it is often cheaper to stick with that supplier for a while, even if costs rise, rather than find a new one in another country.
The car business makes for a good example of what might change and when. The industry may not seem typical of the China story, because it has more to do with American exports than Chinese imports. But exports probably matter more for American jobs anyway, given that low-end toy manufacturing in Guangdong Province isn't moving to Alabama or Michigan.
Like other first-time visitors to China, I have been struck by the number of Buicks on the roads here. In one Beijing traffic jam, three different Buick minivans were idling in the lane next to mine. When was the last time you were surrounded by Buicks?
Unfortunately for American autoworkers, though, none of those Buicks minivans was made in the United States. Buick exports only the high-end Enclave sport utility vehicle to China and makes the rest of its vehicles locally, with a Chinese partner. BMW, similarly, makes the 3- and 5-series here but ships in the costlier 7-series and Z sports cars.
With a stronger renminbi, you could see how carmakers might draw the dividing line in a different place, especially as the Chinese car market grows. The highest-margin vehicles would no longer be the only ones that could support the higher labor and shipping costs -- not to mention China's 25 percent vehicle tariff.
Already, American exports to China are a big deal. They are on pace to equal about $83 billion this year, up from $68 billion last year and $21 billion a decade ago, adjusted for inflation. As a point of reference, $10 billion of gross domestic product equals about 80,000 jobs on average. So every extra $10 billion of goods sold to China is like its own little stimulus program.
Like any other stimulus, this one will require some politics -- namely, pressuring China and negotiating with it. Companies will have to make clear, as General Electric, Microsoft and others have begun to, that their growth in China depends on the government taking property rights seriously and being more open to foreigners. As one European executive of a Chinese technology firm told me, "Foreigners can't do anything alone here."
The United States and other countries, meanwhile, will have to look for any possible leverage to reduce tariffs and other barriers and push up the renminbi. China is eager to buy advanced technology, for example, and not all the items on the United States' forbidden list are truly matters of national security. The Obama administration has started to prune this list.
Then, of course, there are those bills before Congress ominously threatening to put new tariffs on Chinese imports. The bills have definitely gotten China's attention. If anything, they are a hotter topic in Beijing than in Washington, filling state-run newspapers and broadcasts.
The tricky part now is using the credible threat of tariffs to force a faster rise in the renminbi -- which is up only 1.6 percent since 2008, mostly in the last two weeks -- without setting off a trade war that would cost jobs in both countries.
With the benefit of hindsight, we can see the real lesson of that story about the yen is that success can take time. The yen has continued to gain strength since the 1980s and, even after its fall in the last week, it is still more than twice as high versus the dollar as in 1985. Not coincidentally, the trade deficit with Japan, as a share of the economy, has shrunk 66 percent.
This is the path that rising economic powers, from Germany to the United States to Japan, have taken before. They start as exporters and then build up a thriving domestic economy. (Japan, alas, hasn't been so good at the second part.) It's the path China needs to take now, for the sake of its citizens and for the world.
The currency move of the past couple of weeks is a good start -- so long as it continues.

Abstract: Sahara India Pariwar, India's biggest film production company, which also operates multiplex cinemas, understands the prevailing Hollywood business model. Maybe the next Bond film could even be released on the Web -- whereby advertising revenue would supplant box office sales -- just in time for the 50th anniversary of the franchise in 2012.

Full text: One of India's top film producers, Sahara India Pariwar, is interested in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, James Bond's Hollywood studio. That may sound groundbreaking, but a purchase of MGM by the Indian conglomerate would probably provoke only relief in Tinseltown because it would not upset the industry's status quo. A more radical buyout could be something Google's YouTube unit might be capable of, if it dares.
Sahara India Pariwar, India's biggest film production company, which also operates multiplex cinemas, understands the prevailing Hollywood business model. Films are released first in theaters and then eventually appear on DVD and Blu-ray, on pay television, and on the Internet. The basic idea is that customers pay extra to see movies sooner, especially during the theatrical "window."
That model, though, could be ripe for a shake-up amid the rise of Web-based video, led by YouTube, Hulu, Netflix and Apple iTunes. YouTube aside, these emerging channels have collaborated with content producers and have little interest in upsetting the industry. Hulu, for instance, is owned by three television networks. Netflix and iTunes have struck deals with producers to distribute their content, after a delay, to paying customers.
YouTube is a little different, and it's the big player of the bunch. Four years after Google paid $1.6 billion for the business, people are watching two billion videos a day on the Web site. Yet the division is still a money loser though it is on the verge of making a profit. That's because those videos mostly aren't the kind that people pay for or advertisers crave. Long term, it's hard to see how YouTube can turn its scale into cash without far greater access to original programming than it has currently planned.
Experiments in paid content and live streaming represent one type of response from YouTube. But it's another possibility that particularly alarms some in Hollywood. With $30 billion of cash, Google could easily make an offer that MGM's creditors couldn't refuse. Owning MGM would allow YouTube to vault ahead of its rivals by bypassing the theatrical window. Maybe the next Bond film could even be released on the Web -- whereby advertising revenue would supplant box office sales -- just in time for the 50th anniversary of the franchise in 2012.
All that may sound like a stretch, but Google has already done plenty to disrupt media industry conventions. Hollywood may thank Bollywood for delaying another shock.
China Goes Shopping
China's conquistadores are blazing a trail into South America. Two Chinese state-owned oil companies are considering a stake in OGX of Brazil. There's also talk of a Chinese bid for part of BP's Argentine joint venture. At a recent investor forum, one Chinese executive likened the continent to a new Africa. The colonial comparison is apt, but South America may be a less fulfilling El Dorado.
Today's explorers aren't searching for gold, but for resources, notably iron, copper, and farmland. Previously trade was the chosen means of securing them, while investment remained paltry. Brazil has tripled its trade surplus with China to around $15 billion in four years. Copper-rich Chile followed a similar pattern.
Direct investment is catching up. China is the biggest foreign investor in Brazil this year. Once capital-starved Latin governments welcome the change: Brazil's government has had to run interest rates double the level of inflation. Venezuela and Brazil have both offered up oil flows for investment and loans.
China's interest in the region partly reflects rising barriers elsewhere. Canada, Australia and the United States have erected defenses around mining and agricultural resources, or threatened to. Latin America and Africa, by comparison, remain open for business.
But South America's needs are different from Africa's. China has wooed countries like South Africa, Ghana and Kenya by building ports and railways, because what it lacks in resources it makes up for in infrastructure expertise and surplus labor. But South America has those already in abundance. That changes the calculus. The likes of Brazil would prefer a big slice of China's $2.7 trillion foreign reserves.
That's a path to overpaying for assets. Take OGX, the group controlled by the Brazilian billionaire Eike Batista. The company has yet to produce a drop of oil. The more finite resources China buys at exuberant prices, the higher the premium sellers will demand.
Japan learned that lesson when its 1980s foreign investment surge culminated in crazy bids for trophy assets. China's conquistadores have a clearer strategic goal, but they too may leave behind more treasure than they haul away.

Full text: The United States economy has lost more jobs than it has added since the recovery began over a year ago.
Yes, you read that correctly.
The downturn officially ended, and the recovery officially began, in June 2009, according to an announcement Monday by the official arbiter of economic turning points. Since that point, total output -- the amount of goods and services produced by the United States -- has increased, as have many other measures of economic activity.
But nonfarm payrolls are still down 329,000 from their level at the recession's official end 15 months ago, and the slow growth in recent months means that the unemployed still have a long slog ahead.
"We started from a deep hole," said James Poterba, an economics professor at M.I.T. and a member of the National Bureau of Economic Research's Business Cycle Dating Committee, which declared the recession's end. "And clearly the bounce-back has not been immediate after hitting this trough."
The declaration of the recession's end confirms what many suspected: The 2007-9 recession was not only the longest post-World War II recession, but also the deepest, in terms of both job losses and at least one measure of output declines.
The announcement also implies that any contraction that might lie ahead would be a separate and distinct recession, and one that the Obama administration could not claim to have inherited. While economists generally say such a double-dip recession seems unlikely, new monthly estimates of gross domestic product, released by two committee members, show that output shrank in May and June, the most recent months for which data are available. Output and other factors would have to shrink for a longer period of time before another contraction might be declared.
Even without a full-blown double dip in the economy, the recovery thus far has been so anemic that the job picture seems likely to stagnate, and perhaps even get worse, in the near future.
Many forecasters estimate that output needs to grow over the long run by about 2.5 percent to keep the unemployment rate, now at 9.6 percent, constant. The economy grew at an annual rate of just 1.6 percent in the second quarter of this year, and private forecasts indicate growth will not be much better in the third quarter. (The Business Cycle Dating Committee itself does not engage in forecasting.)
"The amount of unemployment we've already got and the slowness of recovery lead to predictions that we could have 9-plus percent unemployment even through the next presidential election," said Robert J. Gordon, an economics professor at Northwestern University and a committee member.
"What's really unique about this recession is the amount of unemployment in combination with the slowness of the recovery," he said. "That's just not happened before. We had a sharp recession followed by a sharp recovery in the 1980s. And in '91 and '01 we had slow recoveries, but those recessions were shallow recessions, so the slowness didn't matter much."
All three of these most recent recoveries have been known as jobless recoveries, as employment growth has significantly lagged output growth. In this recovery, the job market bottomed six months after economic output bottomed. That is still not nearly as much of a lag as experienced after the 2001 recession, when it took the job market 19 months to turn around after output improved.
This new pattern of jobless recoveries has led to some complaints that employment should play a more prominent role in dating business cycles and to criticism that a jobless recovery is not truly a recovery at all. Business Cycle Dating Committee members have been reluctant to change their criteria too drastically, though, because they want to maintain consistency in the official chronology of contractions and expansions.
While all three recent recoveries have been weak for employment, the job market has to cover the most ground from the latest recession.
From December 2007 to June 2009, the American economy lost more than 5 percent of its nonfarm payroll jobs, the largest decline since World War II. And through December 2009, the month that employment hit bottom, the nation had lost more than 6 percent of its jobs.
The unemployment rate, which comes from a different survey, peaked last October at 10.1 percent. The postwar high was in 1982, at 10.8 percent. But the composition of the work force was very different in the 1980s -- it was younger, and younger people tend to have higher unemployment rates -- and so if adjusted for age, unemployment this time around actually looks much worse.
The broadest measure of unemployment, including people who are reluctantly working part time when they wish to be working full time and those who have given up looking for work altogether, also was at its highest level since World War II.
There is some debate, though, about whether this recession was the worst in terms of output.
Adjusted for inflation, output contracted more than in any other postwar period, according to Robert E. Hall, a Stanford economics professor and committee chairman.
But some economists say that a better measure would be the gap between where output is and where it could have been if growth had been uninterrupted.
"It's definitely not as deep as 1981-82 when measured relative to the economy's potential growth rate," Mr. Gordon said.
Besides employment, nearly every indicator that the committee considers simultaneously reached a low point in June 2009, which made that month a relatively easy selection as the official turning point, Mr. Gordon said. The committee previously met in April but had decided that the data were inconclusive.
In its statement on Monday affirming the recession's end, the bureau took care to note that the recession, by definition, meant only the period until the economy reached its low point -- not a return to its previous vigor.
"In declaring the recession over, we're not at all saying the unemployment rate, or anything else, has returned to normal," said James H. Stock, an economics professor at Harvard and a member of the business cycle committee.
"We clearly still have a long ways to go."

Full text: SAO PAULO, Brazil -- Until last week, Dilma Rousseff, the candidate hand-picked by Brazil's president to succeed him, appeared to be cruising to an easy first-round victory in an election next month that would make her the first woman to become president in the country's history.
Riding the coattails of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who will probably go down as his country's most popular president, Ms. Rousseff extended her lead in the polls enough that she seemed poised to capture a majority of votes in the Oct. 3 election and avoid a second round.
But then a political scandal involving Mr. da Silva's chief of staff -- who succeeded Ms. Rousseff in the post in April so that she could campaign -- exploded onto the headlines here, suddenly threatening to push the election to a runoff and sully the da Silva government's reputation.
Erenice Guerra, the former right-hand woman of Ms. Rousseff, resigned Thursday amid a flurry of local news reports accusing her of trafficking in influence under Mr. da Silva's nose. Ms. Guerra, they contend, took part in a lobby run by her son that helped businesses gain access to contracts and state bank loans for public works projects in exchange for money -- some of which was reportedly intended to help finance political campaigns.
Ms. Guerra has denied the allegations and tried to blame the opposition for them, referring to Ms. Rousseff's rival candidate, Jose Serra, as "unethical and already defeated." In her resignation letter she wrote of a "sordid campaign to defame" her image, her work and her family, and said she needed "peace and time" to defend herself from the accusations. She declined to comment further in an interview request.
Mr. da Silva has weathered scandals before and emerged unscathed, but this is the second political crisis in a month involving his Workers' Party. The other recent controversy, in which the tax records of Mr. Serra's daughter and other members of his party were illegally released, seemed to resonate little with average voters, though it did appear to hurt Ms. Rousseff's preference rating among voters in the highest income and education brackets, a very small portion of the electorate.
Poll numbers taken last week, before the more recent scandal started to gain its full momentum, showed that Ms. Rousseff had actually extended her lead over Mr. Serra, the former governor of Sao Paulo.
But analysts said the accusations of influence peddling had the potential to gain more traction with voters, and Mr. Serra is starting to pursue the issue vigorously, saying Ms. Rousseff was either a bad administrator for not knowing about it or had committed a crime if she did know.
"This may change the votes of well-educated, well-informed people," said Paulo Sotero, director of the Brazil Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, and it has the potential to push the voting to a second round. But he said it was unlikely to affect the final outcome.
Alexandre Barros, managing director of Early Warning Consulting, a political consultancy in Brasilia, said, "Most voters don't understand what is going on with these scandals." He speculated that by forcing out Ms. Guerra, Mr. da Silva "will divert bullets from the scandal itself and neutralize whatever ill effects it could have" for Ms. Rousseff.
This year's election has been about continuity, and few Brazilians seem willing to risk upsetting the economic momentum that Mr. da Silva's government has built over eight years.
Neither Ms. Rousseff nor Mr. Serra has come close to matching the charisma or political skills of Mr. da Silva, a former union leader with a fourth-grade education whose humble beginnings have resonated with many Brazilians. But Ms. Rousseff has had the popular president -- and his accomplishments -- in her corner. He brazenly hit the campaign trail with her, trumpeting her administrative skills, and saying he would probably take a role in the new government.
Mr. da Silva's influence has been too much to overcome, political analysts said. Under his leadership, Brazil became the eighth largest economy in the world, enjoyed relatively low inflation, increased prosperity for all economic classes and became a bigger player on the international diplomatic stage.
"A very popular president with an 80 percent approval rating is very hard to campaign against," said David Fleischer, a political science professor at University of Brasilia. Mr. da Silva "totally engaged himself in Dilma's campaign and was able to transfer his approval rating, votes and charisma."
Mr. Serra, an experienced politician and a popular former governor, has run an ineffectual campaign in which he has tried to show he is a better continuation candidate than Ms. Rousseff, who had never before run for political office, analysts said.
"He thought his experience would compensate for Lula's popularity," Mr. Sotero said. "But he did not explain to the Brazilian people what he is for."
Mr. Serra created confusion, analysts said, when he included images of him side by side with Mr. da Silva in campaign television spots, as if to identify himself with the president. But days later, he began to sharply criticize the government.
He also alienated former President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, fearing that Mr. Cardoso was too unpopular with the masses, even though he set the stage for Brazil's recent economic success and has been a unifying opposition force.
Still, the latest allegations against Ms. Guerra raise serious questions about the da Silva government, analysts said. Two of Mr. da Silva's three chiefs of staff have resigned in disgrace. A 2005 vote-buying scandal led Jose Dirceu to step down, damaging the reputation of the Workers' Party, which Mr. da Silva helped found.
No direct link has been made between Ms. Rousseff and any possible influence peddling. But Mr. da Silva's government is not taking any chances. The president has remained in Brazil rather than fly to New York where he had been scheduled to give a speech on Thursday at the United Nations.
Mr. da Silva also reacted quickly to try to contain the growing scandal, asking for Ms. Guerra's resignation five days after the allegations surfaced; he waited 10 days to ask for Mr. Dirceu's resignation in 2005.
Ms. Rousseff, while on a campaign stop on Saturday, told reporters that she had known nothing about a supposed lobbying arrangement. "I was never made aware of that," she said.
But various investigations, which are barely under way, are unlikely to produce any results until after the first round of voting. Anything short of direct evidence showing that Ms. Rousseff was involved in malfeasance is unlikely to upend her chances in the first round now, analysts said.
"Brazil is living a great moment," said Mr. Sotero, the Brazil Institute's director. "Brazilians are happy where they are, and they want more."
Like Americans, "they are very practical people," and in the end, he said, "they vote their pockets."

Full text: WASHINGTON -- With tax rates at the center of the debate over how to revive the stalled recovery, the Federal Reserve is likely to spend its policy meeting on Tuesday weighing the merits of additional steps to stimulate the economy, while deferring some major decisions until later this year.
The meeting will be the Federal Open Market Committee's last scheduled gathering before the midterm elections. And given that the central bank studiously tries to stay outside the fray, the politically delicate moment and the mixed economic indicators of recent weeks suggest that the Fed will hold off for now on a pivotal decision: whether to try to further stimulate the economy by resuming large-scale purchases of Treasury securities to push record-low interest rates even lower.
The central bank took a crucial step toward renewed stimulus last month when it voted to use money the Fed receives from its huge portfolio of mortgage-backed securities to buy long-term Treasury debt. Though fairly modest in scope, the action raised the possibility that the Fed might resume the asset purchases, a strategy known as quantitative easing.
The Fed concluded a major program of such easing in March. The idea behind easing is to put downward pressure on long-term interest rates. Short-term rates, over which the Fed has more direct influence, have already been at nearly zero since the end of 2008.
At the Fed's annual policy symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyo., late last month, the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, made clear he was prepared to take additional action to forestall the danger that the American economy might fall into deflation, a sustained period of falling prices like the one that has afflicted Japan since the early 1990s.
Although the Fed considers that danger remote, it is worried because inflation is running at only about half the desired level of about 2 percent, while unemployment stands at 9.6 percent.
The committee's Aug. 10 meeting was dominated by a vigorous discussion over the decision to reinvest the mortgage-related bond proceeds -- an approach Mr. Bernanke favored. The meeting on Tuesday will probably be used to assess actions the committee might take at its meetings on Nov. 2 and 3 and Dec. 14.
"Officials are likely to spend much of the session debating the pros and cons of the various stimulus options so that they can be ready to act should future data prove disappointing," Richard Berner, chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley, wrote in a report last week.
Continued "fiscal gridlock" -- an inability to reach agreement on how to handle the impending expiration of the Bush-era tax cuts -- would put pressure on the Fed to act, Mr. Berner added. A second round of quantitative easing could lower the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note to 2 percent, from its current level of about 2.75 percent, he estimated.
Laurence H. Meyer, an economic forecaster and former Fed governor, said additional quantitative easing would have a meaningful effect on the economy but would not be a "game changer."
The Fed could announce that it was buying an additional $2 trillion in securities -- nearly doubling its $2.3 trillion balance sheet, which is already two and a half times where it stood before the financial crisis in 2008. Or it could take a more incremental approach, by buying a modest amount of securities and leaving the door open for more.
Mr. Meyer estimated that the "shock-and-awe option" would raise economic growth 0.3 percentage point in 2011 and 0.4 percentage point in 2012, but that unemployment would remain high: 9.2 percent at the end of 2011 and 7.7 percent by the end of 2012.
Even if the effects are modest, many economists are expecting eventual Fed action. "Given the likelihood that unemployment will remain unacceptably high for the foreseeable future, more quantitative easing is looking more and more like an agenda item for the Fed, whether it actually works to stimulate job growth or not," Neal Soss, chief economist at Credit Suisse, wrote in a report last week.
Fed officials have made few public comments in recent weeks, making an evaluation of committee sentiment harder than usual.
Richard W. Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, said in a Sept. 1 speech in Houston that uncertainty over taxes and regulation had caused companies to sit on cash and banks to hold reserves at the Fed rather than make loans.
Mr. Fisher said he would be reluctant to resume large-scale asset purchases, which he said "might be pushing on a string," and possibly set off future inflation.
"For me, the ball is in the fiscal court for now," Mr. Fisher said. "Any further action by the Fed must be subject to the kind of rigorous cost-benefit analysis that Ben Bernanke cited in Jackson Hole."
Mr. Fisher said that officials had been crafting and enforcing tax and regulatory policy "in a capricious manner that makes long-term planning, including expanding payrolls, difficult, if not impossible." He added: "The Fed is not the end-all for curing every economic pathology."
In a Sept. 8 speech in Missoula, Mont., Narayana R. Kocherlakota, president of the Minneapolis Fed, cited statistics about job openings to argue that the high unemployment rate was being fed not so much by a lack of positions per se but by a mismatch of locations and skills.
"The mismatch problems in the labor market do not strike me as readily amenable to the kinds of monetary policy tools currently available to the Fed," he said. "But they may well be amenable to other types of policy tools, like job retraining programs or foreclosure mitigation strategies."
Mr. Kocherlakota also responded to recent reports about Fed dissension.
"We are unabashed technocrats, seeking to solve an unabashedly technical problem: how do we manage monetary policy so as to ensure lower unemployment and maintain inflation at an appropriate rate?" he said. Disagreements, he added, "ultimately stem from different assessments of the complicated economic situation and not from political differences."

Abstract: President Obama plans to press the currency issue, along with complaints about China's policies on trade and intellectual property, at the Group of 20 summit meeting in South Korea in November. The international monetary system has also gotten more complex, with the creation of the euro and the rise of large emerging economies like Brazil, India and Russia.

Full text: CORRECTION APPENDED
WASHINGTON -- Say there was a way to create a half-million American jobs over the next two years without adding a dime to the debt or deficit. And say it would also revive moribund Rust Belt factories, reduce the country's gaping trade deficit and help stabilize the international economic system.
All of this would occur, some economists say, if only China would stop manipulating its currency, keeping it artificially undervalued as a means of boosting its exports and fueling its tremendous economic growth.
Anger over China's exchange-rate policy nearly boiled over in Congressional hearings last week. Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner accused China of violating international norms. President Obama plans to press the currency issue, along with complaints about China's policies on trade and intellectual property, at the Group of 20 summit meeting in South Korea in November.
That China has undervalued its currency, the renminbi, for much of the past decade to boost its surging export-driven economy is not seriously doubted; China intervenes in the markets by buying an estimated $1 billion a day using renminbi. For the lay observer, it's befuddling. Why does this situation persist?
Would China benefit by letting the renminbi rise?
Yes, most experts agree that China would probably be better off if the renminbi's value rose. Doing so would give Chinese consumers more purchasing power, lessen the risk of inflation and asset bubbles, and potentially reduce stark inequalities that have contributed to social unrest.
What's stopping China, then?
Exporters, concentrated along the southern coast, wield enormous clout in Beijing and benefit from an undervalued currency, said Minxin Pei, a political scientist at Claremont McKenna College in Claremont, Calif. So do state-owned enterprises, which have excess capacity and need to be able to sell goods cheaply abroad. China's importers are unhappy with the undervalued renminbi -- as are officials at the central bank -- but both groups are relatively weak.
In the United States, there must be someone against a stronger Chinese currency, right?
Large multinational corporations, and Wall Street, are comfortable with a weak renminbi. Many of the biggest American conglomerates make goods in China (or sell them in the United States) and benefit from the undervalued currency. Financial services companies find deal-making easier with a strong dollar and want to help invest the capital sloshing around China.
But aren't the forces on the other side just as strong?
A high dollar places tremendous competitive pressure on American agricultural producers and domestic manufacturers, and thereby hampers job creation.
So, it's not surprising that Midwest politicians and labor unions have been among China's fiercest critics. High unemployment has also prompted the White House and most Congressional Democrats (and a substantial number of Republicans) to side with the critics.
How have previous problems with a strong dollar been handled?
In the late 1960s, rising federal spending during the Vietnam War and the Great Society pushed inflation upward. The United States had a trade deficit for the first time in the postwar era. Manufacturers were furious. President Richard M. Nixon responded by taking the country off the gold standard in 1971, which caused the dollar to fall by about 20 percent.
From 1981 to 1985, the dollar soared again, as the Federal Reserve boosted interest rates to combat inflation and the Reagan administration borrowed to finance big budget deficits. In September 1985, Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III met Japanese and German officials at the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan. Faced with threats of protectionist action by Congress, the two countries agreed on a plan to devalue the dollar.
So, could such an agreement happen again?
A rapid devaluation of the dollar is unlikely anytime soon. No country, even an ally, wants to see its currency suddenly rise in value (and its exports become more expensive) amid a fragile global recovery. The international monetary system has also gotten more complex, with the creation of the euro and the rise of large emerging economies like Brazil, India and Russia.
Though China allowed its currency to rise by more than 20 percent against the dollar from 2005 to 2008, the financial crisis (which led investors to flock to the dollar) led to a return to old ways. In June, Beijing promised greater exchange-rate flexibility, but since then the renminbi has risen by only about 1 percent. Too little, too late, Mr. Geithner testified last week.
Ultimately, says Jeffry A. Frieden, a Harvard political scientist, exchange rates reflect broader macroeconomic forces. For the dollar to get back in sync, Americans must save and invest more and consume and borrow less, and the Chinese, Germans and Japanese have to recognize that excessive reliance on exports is not to their long-run advantage.
"It's conceivable that the Chinese might conclude it's in their own self-interest to let the currency rise," Professor Frieden said, "but it's not going to come from browbeating and it's not even going to come from well-meaning attempts at cooperation."
Correction: September 26, 2010, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Because of an editing error, an article last Sunday about the possible effects if China lets the value of its currency rise misspelled the given name of a political scientist at Harvard University, who said exchange rates reflect broad macroeconomic forces. He is Jeffry A. Frieden, not Jeffrey.

Full text: REMEMBER the song "Put On a Happy Face"? Just smile, it says, and you'll "spread sunshine all over the place," even if you don't start out feeling very happy yourself.
In many ways, this is fine advice. But if you've ever tried to act on it, you know that it's not always easy to wish optimism into existence.
Optimism, or lack thereof, may seem the province of psychology, not macroeconomics. But the issue is very relevant to the difficulties that policy makers face: a deficit of optimism has much to do with why the United States economy remains stalled today.
The Federal Reserve, pondering what to do to stimulate the economy, has a number of tools at its disposal. But if it could just convince Americans that it was committed to monetary expansion and economic growth, it would help the economy pick up speed.
Yet that is easier said than done. Here's the problem: The economy needs help, but monetary policy, which is the Fed's responsibility, has not been very expansionary. This is true even though the Fed has increased the monetary base enormously since the onset of the financial crisis.
How can this be? Supplying more money did not actually result in enough additional spending. The debilitating financial shock of the last few years convinced many consumers and businesses that they needed to save more. So they are holding on to much of the new money.
Given this problem, there is a logical and seemingly simple move available to the Fed: just make people believe that it is seriously committed to increasing the rate of inflation. Traditionally, the Fed has focused on restraining inflation, not stoking it. But these are unusual times.
If the Fed promises to keep increasing the money supply until prices rise by, say, 3 percent a year, people should eventually start spending. Otherwise, if they just held the money, it would be worth 3 percent less each year.
In a self-fulfilling prophecy, the Fed could stimulate spending and the economy, and at no cost to the Treasury. Of course, if no one believes the Fed's commitment to price inflation, spending and employment will not go up. The plan will fail, and people will view their skepticism as vindicated.
In other words, one of our economic problems can be solved, but only if we are willing to believe it can. Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, wrote about this conundrum before he accepted his current job. In 1999, when discussing what the Japanese central bank could do about the country's deep recession, Mr. Bernanke suggested "a target in the 3 to 4 percent range for inflation, to be maintained for a number of years," saying that it would show the bank's credible commitment to reflate the economy.
Sadly, although Mr. Bernanke clearly understands the problem, the Fed hasn't been acting with much conviction. This is understandable, because if the Fed announces a commitment to a higher inflation target but fails to establish its credibility, it will have shown impotence. It would be a long time before the Fed was trusted again, and the Fed might even lose its (partial) political independence. All of a sudden, the Fed would end up "owning" the recession.
Part of the credibility problem stems from the political environment, especially in Congress. Imagine the day after the announcement of a plan for 3 percent inflation. Older people, creditors and workers on fixed incomes -- all connected to powerful lobbies -- would start to complain. Republicans would wonder whether they had found a new issue on which to campaign, namely, opposition to inflation. And Democrats would worry about what position to take. Presidents of some regional Fed banks would probably oppose the policy publicly.
Although the unemployed might prefer such a policy, they are not well-mobilized politically. And President Obama is himself politically weak at the moment, so he cannot offer the Fed much cover.
Can the Fed walk down this path without blinking? Perhaps not.
The Fed lost some of its political independence during the financial crisis. It undertook major rescue operations in conjunction with the Treasury, and these bailouts proved extremely unpopular. Congress has taken a closer look at Fed operating procedures and will engage in a one-time audit of the Fed's emergency lending. When it comes to inflation, the Fed cannot easily turn to Congress and simply ask to be trusted.
THIS is the sad side story of our financial crisis: especially when it comes to financial matters, a great deal of trust has been lost. There is the prospect of a free lunch right before us, yet it is unclear that we will be able to grab it.
The Federal Open Market Committee, which votes on monetary policy, has three open seats -- a situation that may be hindering the taking of decisive action. The Senate has not been willing to hold a confirmation vote on Mr. Obama's nominations. But filling the seats is not enough; somehow, Fed officials have to believe that Congress is firmly on their side.
In failing to push harder for monetary expansion, is Mr. Bernanke a wise and prudent guardian of the limited discretionary powers of the Fed? Or is he acting like a too-hesitant bureaucrat, afraid to fail and take the blame when he should be gunning for success?
We still don't know which narrative is more accurate, but the Fed is not receiving enough signals of support from Congress.
As high unemployment continues, more and more people, including top economists, are asking the Fed to promise a credible commitment to a more expansionary monetary policy. This approach will work only if the Fed finds a way to be bold -- and if we find a way to believe in it.

Full text: THE Great Recession in America more than earned that title. But by international standards, it was not that bad.
The recession caused a greater decline in gross domestic product in the United States than any American downturn since World War II. It is also in the process of setting the record for the longest downturn, measured in the time it takes for the economy to recover to its prerecession level.
Yet among the world's major industrialized economies, the American recession was among the least severe. And the United States is ahead of most other countries in recovering the lost ground.
From the peak level of economic activity in the fourth quarter of 2007, the American economy shrank 4.1 percent by the time it hit bottom in the second quarter of 2009. Since then, it has recovered most of what was lost, but the size of the economy remains 1.3 percent below the peak, according to preliminary figures for the second quarter of this year.
The accompanying charts show detailed performances of four large industrialized economies, the United States, Japan, Germany and Britain. The other three fell further than the United States, with drops ranging from 6.4 percent in Britain to 8.7 percent in Japan; each has further to go to recover to prerecession levels.
The charts also show the performance of 49 economies around the world. Included are all countries for which data is available and whose lowest quarter was at least 2 percent below the earlier peak level.
Many of the countries that had the worst time of it are former members of the Soviet bloc. The economies of the three Baltic states -- Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia -- all shrank by at least 18 percent. The only other economy to perform that poorly was Ukraine, also a former Soviet republic. Former Soviet bloc countries have also lagged in recovering from the downturn.
In other parts of Europe, the performance was generally better. But some countries -- notably Iceland and Ireland -- were severely damaged in part because major financial institutions collapsed.
It may be surprising that Greece's national output declined less than Germany's. But Greece's economy is still shrinking, while Germany has recovered much of its losses. But the figures are only as good as the national statistics office compiling them, and Greece's reputation on that score is not good.
All figures are measured in local currency, adjusted for inflation.
Until the recent recession, the deepest fall for the American economy since World War II was a 3.7 percent drop during the brief but steep downturn in 1958.
In the 1970s recession brought on by soaring oil prices, the economy took seven quarters to grow back to where it was before the recession, longer than any other postwar downturn. The figure now is 10 quarters and counting.
When the recent financial crisis was at its height, few countries escaped downturns. World trade volumes collapsed, devastating exporters in Asia and Latin America. But most of those countries quickly recovered; their economies are now larger than before the crisis hit.
China does not report exact quarterly figures, making it impossible to know how bad the situation became, but Hong Kong and Taiwan, which do provide numbers, were hurt. Taiwan and Turkey are the only countries that have completely recovered from a double-digit fall in G.D.P.
Some countries managed to escape a downturn or, at worst, had only a small and brief decline. Argentina, India, Indonesia, the Philippines, Tunisia, Israel and Jordan are in that group. Poland's economy, unlike those of its Eastern European neighbors, has regained more than it lost in its shallow downturn.
Developed countries with robust natural resources sectors also fared well. Australia performed better than any other major industrialized economy; its G.D.P. fell less than 1 percent even at the worst of the crisis. Canada did experience a recession, but it has recovered nearly all of what was lost.

Abstract: Officials from the Federal Open Market Committee last met on Aug. 10, when, with short-term interest rates close to zero, they voted to use proceeds from the Fed's mortgage bonds to buy long-term Treasury securities, a measure that signaled growing concern about the slowing recovery and the risk of deflation.

Full text: Consumer prices remained mostly flat in August, according to a government report released Friday, another sign that inflation is so tame that the economy could be on the brink of deflation.
Just days ahead of a Federal Reserve policy meeting, the Labor Department said the Consumer Price Index, a benchmark measure of inflation, rose 0.3 percent in August, compared with 0.3 percent in July, on a seasonally adjusted basis. Excluding volatile energy and food prices, the core index was flat in August. It had risen 0.1 percent in July, and 0.2 percent in June.
Year-over-year core inflation has been running at 0.9 percent for five consecutive months, its lowest pace in more than 50 years.
The C.P.I. results were in line with analysts' forecasts, which had called for a 0.3 percent increase in August, with the core index up 0.1 percent.
The report came a day after the Labor Department announced that higher energy costs pushed its Producer Price Index slightly higher in August. The index, which follows prices paid to producers for goods, rose 0.4 percent in August after a 0.2 percent increase in July, the first in three months.
The data sets the stage for Federal Reserve policy makers, who are meeting on Tuesday against the backdrop of an economy with stable and extremely low inflation, suggestions of deflation, sluggish growth and struggling job and housing markets.
Officials from the Federal Open Market Committee last met on Aug. 10, when, with short-term interest rates close to zero, they voted to use proceeds from the Fed's mortgage bonds to buy long-term Treasury securities, a measure that signaled growing concern about the slowing recovery and the risk of deflation.
Such meetings have been preceded by weeks of speculation about what action Fed officials might take, and how or if they would adjust their language on the economy in the announcements after the meeting. The C.P.I. numbers fueled speculation among economists and in financial markets about the potential for further Fed action.
Dan Greenhaus, chief economic strategist for Miller Tabak & Company, said his firm already expected the Federal Reserve to start a second round of quantitative easing "toward the end of this year or beginning of next, and a flat reading on core inflation only increases those odds." Quantitative easing refers to a monetary policy aimed at increasing the excess reserves of banks, and thus encouraging more lending.
"They could buy additional assets in an effort to drive down interest rates and spur more economic activity than they are seeing," he said.
Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank, said he expected the Fed to maintain the status quo. "I suspect that if they see greater signs of weakness later this year they could institute something a bit more forceful in terms of quantitative easing," he said.
The bond market rallied Friday, while the broader stock market was mostly flat. The markets also absorbed a Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary September reading on consumer sentiment that came in at 66.6, down from 68.9 in August.
Paul D. Ballew, a former senior economist with the Federal Reserve, said he expected policy makers to have discussions on several fronts, including the pace of the recovery and the direction of fiscal policy pertaining to taxes and spending levels. He also expects them to continue their "communications strategy" to convey the message that the central bank is ready to continue to provide support.
Mr. Ballew, who is now a senior vice president with Nationwide, called it the " 'keep the spirits up' approach."
"The question for the Fed at that juncture is, are we seeing signs of the recovery picking up the pace a bit?" he added.
Last month, Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, described inflation as being "slightly below" the desirable level, but said deflation was "not a significant risk." He said the Fed would "strongly resist deviations from price stability in the downward direction."
James F. O'Sullivan, the chief economist of MF Global Ltd., noted that since Mr. Bernanke spoke, some of the crucial macroeconomic numbers, like retail sales and weekly jobless claims, have not deteriorated to the extent that would prompt a move by the Fed.
"It seems highly unlikely they are going to initiate a new round of asset purchases," Mr. O'Sullivan said.
"The message from Fed officials in the last couple of weeks is that it is clearly on the table," he said. "But there is not enough agreement on it yet to start up the program and they want to wait out the data to see what happens."
But the sluggish economy has been challenging as the Fed works to meet its mandate of securing price stability while promoting employment. Fed officials have signaled that they would take measures to address any continued weakening in the job market and other areas.

U.S. Steps Up Criticism of China's Practices

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration increased its criticism of China's economic policies on Thursday, as Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner told Congress that China had substantially undervalued its currency to gain an unfair trade advantage, tolerated theft of foreign technology and created unreasonable barriers to American imports.
But the election year anger from lawmakers seemed to surpass even Mr. Geithner's tougher posture. Lawmakers expressed impatience with the administration's familiar reliance on persuasion and negotiation, saying such tactics had yielded little.
In Beijing, a spokeswoman for the Foreign Ministry said that China would not respond to pressure and that a revaluation of the currency, the renminbi, would do little to affect the United States trade deficit with China. But the renminbi strengthened by 0.27 percent to end trading at 6.72 per dollar Thursday as the government appeared to belatedly permit the greater currency flexibility it had promised in June.
Dismay over China's currency interventions -- it buys about $1 billion a day to maintain the renminbi's peg to the dollar -- has been a recurring theme for years. The election-season rhetoric, the carefully calibrated strengthening of the Chinese currency on the eve of Mr. Geithner's appearance, and the administration's struggle to negotiate a diplomatic line set the stage for predictable political theater.
But now, with the United States in a stalled economic recovery and lawmakers facing a restive electorate, the administration is clearly looking for alternative ways to bring pressure on the Chinese.
Mr. Geithner urged China to allow "significant, sustained appreciation" of its undervalued currency and even suggested that anything less would strain the relations of the world's two largest economies. He made it clear that President Obama would press the issue with China's leaders, giving rise to a potentially pivotal moment in November when leaders of the Group of 20 economic powers meet in South Korea.
Still, Mr. Geithner's plan did not appear to mollify lawmakers.
"There is no question that the economic and trade policies of China represent clear roadblocks to our recovery," Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut and the chairman of the Banking Committee, told Mr. Geithner at a hearing. "I've listened to every administration, Democrats and Republicans, from Ronald Reagan to the current administration, say virtually the same thing, producing the same results. China does basically whatever it wants, while we grow weaker and they grow stronger."
Mr. Dodd, who is not seeking re-election, added: "It's clearly time for a change in strategy."
Successive administrations have declined to formally designate China a currency manipulator -- a finding that could initiate American retaliatory measures -- something that has frustrated lawmakers.
"There is no question that China manipulates its currency in order to subsidize Chinese exports," said the top Republican on the committee, Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama. "The only question is, Why is the administration protecting China by refusing to designate it as a currency manipulator?"
Pointing to Mr. Geithner, Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, said: "I'm increasingly coming to the view that the only person in this room who believes China is not manipulating its currency is you."
Mr. Geithner avoided using any version of the word "manipulation," making it clear that he thought such a finding would only antagonize the Chinese without having much practical effect beyond requiring American officials to engage in talks -- something the administration has already been doing.
Partly in response to American pressure, China permitted the renminbi to rise about 20 to 25 percent from 2005 to 2008, but then stopped the currency from strengthening as the financial crisis threatened the strength of its export-oriented economy.
C. Randall Henning, a political scientist in the School of International Service at American University in Washington and an authority on exchange-rate policy, said it was in China's interest to allow the renminbi to rise in value. The currency interventions have raised the threat of inflation and asset bubbles, hurt the poorer sectors of the country's economy and depressed domestic consumption.
But export interests dominate policy-making within the Chinese government, and consumers have little voice within the communist regime, so "we are likely to see policy shift toward appreciation only when price stability, financial stability or exports are threatened," Mr. Henning said.
Business interests in the United States are sharply divided on the currency issue. Domestic manufacturers and labor unions say that China's currency policies have eviscerated industrial employment. But large multinational companies, particularly those with extensive production facilities in China, benefit from a weak renminbi just as Chinese manufacturers do.
Those companies, along with Wall Street firms, are fearful -- as Mr. Geithner acknowledged -- that excessive pressure could lead China to retaliate against their operations in China. In the worst case, they are worried that the two countries could get mired in a trade war.
A House bill with more than 140 sponsors would virtually compel the administration to find China to be a manipulator and impose duties or other trade barriers in retaliation. Mr. Geithner does not support the proposal, which the administration says would violate United States obligations as a member of the World Trade Organization.
Mr. Geithner said the Treasury would "take China's actions into account" in preparing the administration's next foreign exchange report, which is due to Congress on Oct. 15 but will probably be delayed, as previous reports have been, as officials continue to talk to the Chinese.
The secretary also laid out other concerns about China's policies, including "indigenous innovation," a set of practices that American officials say result in discrimination against foreign products and technology.
The secretary attacked what he called "rampant" violations of intellectual property rights and an "unacceptable" level of theft of technology.
He also criticized a proposal by China to require that certain products be accredited before being sold to its government. The United States says that such requirements might violate standards of the W.T.O., which China joined in 2001.
Mr. Geithner pledged that the administration would be "aggressively using the full set of trade remedies available to us," including filing new cases with the W.T.O. The United States trade representative's office filed two such cases on Wednesday.
He said the administration was "reviewing carefully" a complaint by the United Steelworkers union over Chinese practices in the renewable energy sector.

Abstract: Cliff Waldman, an economist for the Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI, said with the year-on-year core consumer price index falling, and less subject to the volatility of raw materials prices than the producer index, deflation was still a big question mark. Analysts and economists have been sifting through economic figures that have suggested a sluggish economy, with gross domestic product revised down to an annual growth rate of 1.6 percent, unemployment of 9.6 percent and a weak housing market.

Full text: Higher energy costs pushed the overall measure of producer prices higher in August, the government said Thursday, a modest increase that many analysts said reduced concerns about the possibility of deflation even as the economy continued to recover.
The Labor Department said that its Producer Price Index, which follows prices that producers are paid for goods before they are sold to consumers, rose 0.4 percent in August after a 0.2 percent increase in July. That increase was the first in the index in three months.
The August rise was attributed to a 2.2 percent increase in energy prices. When volatile food and energy prices are removed, the core index rose 0.1 percent in August, compared with a 0.3 percent increase in July, which was the largest gain since January. Food prices fell 0.3 percent in August, the fourth decline in five months.
Analysts had forecast a 0.3 percent increase in the August month-on-month figure with the core index up 0.1 percent.
"The figures were positive for both the total and the core level," said Lawrence R. Creatura, vice president at Federated Clover Investment Advisors. "There are no symptoms of inflation here, nor are there symptoms of deflation. Prices in the pipeline are going up, not down."
Economists have been watching the index to help analyze the prospects for price pressures in a period of slow growth. Consumer prices for August will be released on Friday, and the consensus calls for an increase of 0.3 percent in the broader index and 0.1 percent in the core index, the same as July.
But the reports reflect aggregates of different parts in the economy, so consumer prices could still rise in some contexts.
"Just because the total doesn't show dislocation, it does not mean things are calm under the surface," Mr. Creatura said. "It is possible to have deflation in housing offsetting inflation in commodities, and that could result in what appears to be benign C.P.I. But that doesn't mean it doesn't hurt when you get to the checkout in the supermarket."
With the risk of inflation below the Federal Reserve's implicit goal of 2 percent, some officials had expressed concern that the economy could enter a period of falling wages and prices. Last month, the Federal Reserve, signaling its worries about the risk of deflation, voted to use proceeds from its mortgage bonds to buy long-term Treasuries to bolster the economy.
Cliff Waldman, an economist for the Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI, said with the year-on-year core consumer price index falling, and less subject to the volatility of raw materials prices than the producer index, deflation was still a "big question mark."
"We are in an interesting no man's land with inflation and deflation," he said. "We will probably skirt deflation, but just barely."
In another report on Thursday, the Commerce Department said that the current-account trade deficit increased to $123.3 billion in the second quarter, a 12.9 percent increase from the first three months of the year. The current account is the broadest measure of America's international trade, tracking the flow of goods and services as well as investments.
Exports in the quarter totaled $316.1 billion, a 3.4 percent rise from the previous quarter, while imports grew to $485.7 billion in the quarter, up 6.3 percent.
Nigel Gault, the chief United States economist for IHS Global Insight, said he had forecast a 1 percent increase for the broader index in the producer price report because of the increase in gasoline prices in August compared with July. "I do not place a lot of significance in that because gasoline prices have come down since then," he said.
But he said it was likely the economy would go through a prolonged period of very low inflation, with depressed use in industry and unemployment.
Analysts and economists have been sifting through economic figures that have suggested a sluggish economy, with gross domestic product revised down to an annual growth rate of 1.6 percent, unemployment of 9.6 percent and a weak housing market.
In addition to the producer prices, new figures on weekly initial jobless claims, which fell last month to their lowest level since July, were released on Thursday.
The Labor Department said Thursday that new claims for jobless benefits fell by 3,000 to a seasonally adjusted 450,000. It was the third decline in four weeks, and defied economists' expectations of an increase to 459,000.
The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia's survey of regional business conditions was released, suggesting nearly flat manufacturing activity in September.
It said for the second consecutive month, companies in the Philadelphia region, which covers Delaware, eastern Pennsylvania and southern New Jersey, reported a decline in new orders and shipments, and although employment levels held steady, companies reported declines in average work hours. The index of current activity was on an upward trend of minus 0.7 in September from minus 7.7 in August.
John Lonski, a chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets, said the reports, and concerns over sliding home prices, were likely to capture much of the financial market focus on Thursday.
"I think it would be a surprise if the P.P.I. boosted fears of price deflation," he said. "We are not there quite yet."

Abstract: Switzerland abandoned that effort, after its central bank had lost more than 14 billion Swiss francs ($14 billion) in foreign currency holdings in the first half of the year, after a fall in the euro's value ate into the bank's reserves.

Full text: TOKYO -- Japan's decision to intervene in currency markets to weaken the yen and shore up its export-driven economy could be only the first step in a long battle -- one made more difficult because Japan, unable to find support among its trading partners, must go it alone.
Japan moved Wednesday to prop up the United States dollar and weaken the yen, directly manipulating its currency for the first time since 2004. Japanese monetary authorities appeared to have bought dollars and sold yen. That move started a wider market rally that sent the dollar up by about 2.55 percent for the day, to 85.62 yen.
The maneuver by Japan's finance ministry came after the yen had reached 15-year highs in recent weeks, elevated by its status as a haven among risk-averse global investors. The strong yen has hampered Japan's recovery from last year's severe recession by weighing on the competitiveness of its exports, which account for a bulk of the nation's economic growth.
"We conducted a currency intervention to check excessive volatility in currency markets," Yoshihiko Noda, the finance minister, said Wednesday. "We will continue to watch currency market moves and take decisive steps if necessary, including intervention."
It is unlikely, though, that intervention by Japan alone will sway currency markets in the long term. The global volume of foreign exchange trading has grown rapidly in recent years, which prevents intervention by a single government from countering bigger market trends.
Other countries are unlikely to help Japan's cause, because they need to keep their own currencies weaker to bolster exports. A weak currency makes a country's exports more competitive and increases the value of overseas earnings.
Much of the yen's weakening came from investors selling the currency on expectations that the Japanese government would be more active in keeping the yen in check. Japan did not disclose how much it had spent in currency transactions, but dealers put the initial amount at 300 billion to 500 billion yen ($3.5 billion to $5.8 billion).
But as Switzerland found this year, a single government's efforts to weaken its currency can prove futile. Switzerland abandoned that effort, after its central bank had lost more than 14 billion Swiss francs ($14 billion) in foreign currency holdings in the first half of the year, after a fall in the euro's value ate into the bank's reserves.
The Swiss franc is also seen by investors as a relative haven and has also strengthened amid global financial unrest. This month, the franc hit a record high against the euro.
"The Japanese authorities need to be aggressive now and hit the market hard, fast and furious, because as time goes on, the announcement effect will dissipate," David Bloom, global head of FX Strategy Research, said in a report to clients Wednesday. "For this to actually work, what is needed is global cooperation."
The intervention by Japan runs counter to a recent trend among the world's major economies to stay away from market manipulation and let markets decide the strength of their currencies. The United States, for example, has pressured China to stop keeping its currency, the renminbi, artificially weak against the dollar.
Japan's move came after Prime Minister Naoto Kan's victory over a challenger in a partywide ballot on Tuesday. Analysts had initially predicted that the victory by Mr. Kan, who had been less explicit about the need for intervention than his rival, Ichiro Ozawa, would probably not lead to action in currency markets.
Mr. Kan had initially been cautious on outright intervention, opting instead to issue statements hinting at some sort of government action in an attempt to talk down the yen. But Wednesday's action reflected the intense pressure on the prime minister to take more drastic action.
Yoshito Sengoku, the government's top spokesman, indicated Wednesday that the finance ministry -- which orchestrated the intervention -- considers 82 yen to the dollar a benchmark in deciding whether to intervene in markets. The exchange rate had recently neared that point.
He indicated Wednesday that Japanese currency officials were still trying to gauge the reaction of their counterparts in the United States and Europe to the intervention, but he did not disclose any details.
The European Central Bank had no comment on the intervention. European companies, especially German companies, have benefited from the weaker euro, which gives them an advantage over Japanese competitors in the machinery and auto industries.
Natalie Wyeth, a spokeswoman for the United States Treasury, declined to comment on Wednesday.
The intervention drew praise from Japanese exporters. The Nikkei 225 stock average rose 2.3 percent to close at 9,516.56 after losing as much as 1.1 percent earlier.
"We applaud the move by the government and the Bank of Japan to correct the yen's strength," Honda Motor, the No. 2 automaker in Japan after Toyota, said in a statement. Tokyo's intervention would have more effect if the Japanese central bank followed with more monetary easing. Such a move would be meant to widen differentials between Japan's rock-bottom interest rates and those of other countries, making holding the yen less attractive for investors and creating more downward pressure on the currency.
Lower interest rates worldwide since the financial crisis -- particularly in the United States, which has engaged in its own rounds of monetary easing -- have reduced the spread, or difference, between Japan's interest rates and those elsewhere. That narrowed gap has changed the habits of investors who for years borrowed yen at low interest rates, then invested in higher-yielding currencies -- a practice that helped to keep the yen weak for much of the last decade.
The Bank of Japan also faces the decision of whether to support the finance ministry's move by letting the money released in the currency transactions continue to circulate -- or whether to counter the move by absorbing the excess money that results from selling the yen. Such a countermove, a measure known as sterilization, would be help keep inflationary side effects in check.
But analysts said they expected the central bank to leave the money in circulation because Japan's sluggish economy was mired in deflation, or the fall in prices, and that any inflation would in fact be a bonus.
And in a statement, Masaaki Shirakawa, the governor of the Bank of Japan, seemed to substantiate that expectation. He said the bank would pursue "strong monetary easing" and provide liquidity to financial markets.
The central bank, though, has been averse to what it sees as too much easing, and has been keen to assert its independence from the Japanese government, adding some uncertainty to how effective the intervention will be.
"The biggest question is whether the scale of the intervention will grow and lead Japan into a quagmire," said Yasuhide Yajima, senior economist at the NLI Research Institute in Tokyo, "or whether the yen will weaken enough for Japan to go back to a wait-and-see stance."

Full text: The blind self-belief of financiers can't be abolished. Neither can the industry's cycles. But two years after the disastrous failure of Lehman Brothers, regulatory shifts have the potential to reduce the impact of a repeat. The challenge for politicians and watchdogs is not to go soft.
That's what happened before. A munificent Federal Reserve helped stoke a leverage bubble that masqueraded as "the Great Moderation." Meanwhile, financial regulators of all stripes dozed off, encouraged by lawmakers too cozy with Big Finance.
Then there was the costly bust. The pendulum's swing from greed to fear has produced useful results. One is an effort to create powers for the orderly closure of a firm like Lehman. Tougher capital standards make sense. And new rules and greater scrutiny for the over-the-counter derivatives market, one source of the interconnectedness that made Lehman's failure so painful over and above its size, were overdue.
Yet supervisors didn't use their already existent powers energetically enough to crimp the activities of institutions later deemed too big to fail. For all the talk of building capital buffers in good times, today's response to the financial crisis -- not to mention what little penitence there is on the part of banks -- looks pro-cyclical.
Only the next Lehman will show whether lessons have been learned. Restructured bank pay mechanisms could make excessive risk slightly less rewarding, but bankers won't stop their boundless quest for riches. If Son of Lehman has more capital and a better match between its assets and liabilities, failure will be less likely. And the intended financial euthanasia option should keep repercussions from spreading as far.
But authorities must remain vigilant and skeptical, beyond enforcing new rules. After all, in mid-2008, Lehman would have comfortably exceeded new Basel III capital standards.
The Fed will have to lead the way. Invested with more supervisory clout than ever, it needs to show a clear willingness to close failing institutions, even if it means eliminating perceived major providers of liquidity. For watchdogs insulated thinly, at best, from politics, this will be the real test. Flunking will only confirm the morally hazardous idea that the government, armed with taxpayers' money, will always blink first.
Windfall Risk
A planned $32 billion capital-raising by Petrobras, the Brazilian energy group, is just the start of an influx of foreign cash that could over-inflate the country's currency and strangle manufacturers. Soaring oil output will add to the problem. Discipline is needed.
Rather than spurring economic development, resource windfalls have often sucked investment from other sectors and stunted industrialization. This is the so-called Dutch disease, a term coined in the 1970s after revenue from large natural gas finds in the Netherlands ended up constraining the domestic industrial sector. A resource bonanza also encourages politicians to lock in high government spending, sparking inflation and linking the nation's fate to commodity prices.
Brazil is vulnerable. Vast reserves of deep-sea oil discovered in recent years promise to catapult it from a bit player to one of the world's top 10 producers. Petrobras alone hopes to double oil production to 5.4 billion barrels a day by 2020. At current prices this would mean an added inflow of about $80 billion a year, equivalent to about half last year's total exports. And that's without considering output from rival oil majors and the smaller domestic upstart OGX.
That could easily create a surge in the real, already 40 percent up against the dollar since the end of the financial crisis. In turn, that might threaten the real strides Brazil has made in areas beyond oil. The nation has quietly accumulated just over 1 percent of the global export market for cars and 3 percent for aircraft.
Brazilian leaders aren't blind to the danger. A planned social fund could stash oil revenue in foreign assets, partly neutralizing currency inflows and reducing the temptation for the government to splurge. Yet even countries that have established such funds, including Chile and Norway, have come under heavy pressure to raid the cookie jar.
Brazil's economy has been well run for the last decade. But there is a much longer history of governments succumbing to populist pressures. It will test the country's political maturity to ensure its oil endowment keeps on giving. RICHARD BEALES and CHRISTOPHER SWANN

Abstract: Yields on benchmark euro zone government bonds pushed higher -- including those of Germany -- suggesting that investors retained fears about sovereign risk.

Full text: The European Commission significantly raised its growth forecast for the region on Monday because of strong output data during the second quarter, and said that the recovery was starting to broaden across sectors.
In the latest of its twice-yearly economic forecasts, the commission predicted a growth rate for 2010 of 1.7 percent in the 16-nation euro area, and 1.8 percent for the 27-member European Union. Those were upward revisions of around three-quarters of a percentage point compared with the last forecast in May.
It stressed that the recovery was uneven across countries. The higher forecast was based on new, more positive assessments of Britain, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland and Spain, which account for about 80 percent of the European Union's gross domestic product.
This unevenness reflects differences in production structures, the scale of adjustment challenges and rebalancing within the European Union and the countries that use the euro.
But it added that the recovery was broadening "across sectors and demand components." In particular, it noted a better contribution of private investment and consumption to growth in the second quarter of 2010, exceeding the combined contributions of inventories and net exports.
"This rebalancing is encouraging, especially as the weaker external environment in the second part of the year is set to have a dampening effect on E.U. export growth," the report said.
It noted, however, that financial markets were still fragile, having recovered only partly from the tensions experienced in the spring, when investors fled certain European bonds, fearing defaults.
Over all, the new assessment appeared to help bolster European markets. The Euro Stoxx 50 index rose 0.89 percent and the FTSE 100 in London added 1.16 percent on Monday. The euro advanced to $1.2867. Yields on benchmark euro zone government bonds pushed higher -- including those of Germany -- suggesting that investors retained fears about sovereign risk.
The commission stressed that the pace of growth would moderate during the second half, reflecting the softening of the global economy and the fading of the temporary factors that helped start the recovery. It forecast a 0.5 percent expansion in the European Union and euro area in the third quarter, and 0.4 percent for the third quarter followed by 0.3 percent in the fourth.
"The European economy is clearly on a path of recovery," said Olli Rehn, the economic and monetary affairs commissioner. "The rebound of domestic demand bodes well for the job market."
Financial stability and fiscal consolidation are the priorities for the future, he said.
The commission presented a picture of still benign inflation, forecasting a 1.8 percent rate this year for the European Union and 1.4 percent in the euro area. Those forecasts were little changed from May.
Just as the outlook in Europe appears to be improving, the global picture is worrying some analysts and policy makers.
Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the European Central Bank, said Monday that while growth in emerging markets was strong, it remained subdued in the developed countries.
At a news conference in Basel, Switzerland, he repeated that he did not expect the advanced economies to slip back into recession, and also that he did not see a significant risk of deflation.
Separately, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said Monday that its July index of composite leading indicators pointed to "clearer signs of a moderation in the pace of expansion to last month's assessment."
The index is a collation of economic indicators that provides early signals of turning points in business cycles in advanced economies. It fell by 0.1 percentage point in July from June, when it also fell. During the three months before June, the index had risen.
In Britain, Canada, China, France, Italy and India, there are stronger signals of a slower pace of growth in coming months, while there are also stronger signals that the expansion may lose momentum in Japan, the United States and Brazil, it said.

Full text: We can keep wishing and hoping for a powerful economic recovery to pull the U.S. out of its doldrums, but I wouldn't count on it. Ordinary American families no longer have the purchasing power to build a strong recovery and keep it going.
Americans are not being honest with themselves about the structural changes in the economy that have bestowed fabulous wealth on a tiny sliver at the top, while undermining the living standards of the middle class and absolutely crushing the poor. Neither the Democrats nor the Republicans have a viable strategy for reversing this dreadful state of affairs. (There is no evidence the G.O.P. even wants to.)
Robert Reich, in his new book, "Aftershock," gives us one of the clearest explanations to date of what has happened -- how the United States went from what he calls "the Great Prosperity" of 1947 to 1975 to the Great Recession that has hobbled the U.S. economy and darkened the future of younger Americans.
He gives the Obama administration and the Federal Reserve credit for moving quickly in terms of fiscal and monetary policies to prevent the economic crash of 2008 from driving the U.S. into a second great depression. "But," he writes, "we did not learn the larger lesson of the 1930s: that when the distribution of income gets too far out of whack, the economy needs to be reorganized so the broad middle class has enough buying power to rejuvenate the economy over the longer term."
The middle class is finally on its knees. Jobs are scarce and good jobs even scarcer. Government and corporate policies have been whacking working Americans every which way for the past three or four decades. While globalization and technological wizardry were wreaking employment havoc, the movers and shakers in government and in the board rooms of the great corporations were embracing privatization and deregulation with the fervor of fanatics. The safety net was shredded, unions were brutally attacked and demonized, employment training and jobs programs were eliminated, higher education costs skyrocketed, and the nation's infrastructure, a key to long-term industrial and economic health, deteriorated.
It's a wonder matters aren't worse.
While all this was happening, working people, including those in the vast middle class, coped as best they could. Women went into the paid work force in droves. Many workers increased their hours or took on second and third jobs. Savings were drained and debt of every imaginable kind -- from credit cards to mortgages to student loans -- exploded.
With those coping mechanisms now exhausted, it's painfully obvious that the economy has failed working Americans.
There was plenty of growth, but the economic benefits went overwhelmingly -- and unfairly -- to those already at the top. Mr. Reich cites the work of analysts who have tracked the increasing share of national income that has gone to the top 1 percent of earners since the 1970s, when their share was 8 percent to 9 percent. In the 1980s, it rose to 10 percent to 14 percent. In the late-'90s, it was 15 percent to 19 percent. In 2005, it passed 21 percent. By 2007, the last year for which complete data are available, the richest 1 percent were taking more than 23 percent of all income.
The richest one-tenth of 1 percent, representing just 13,000 households, took in more than 11 percent of total income in 2007.
That does not leave enough spending power with the rest of the population to sustain a flourishing economy. This is a point emphasized in "Aftershock." Mr. Reich, a former labor secretary in the Clinton administration, writes: "The wages of the typical American hardly increased in the three decades leading up to the Crash of 2008, considering inflation. In the 2000s, they actually dropped."
A male worker earning the median wage in 2007 earned less than the median wage, adjusted for inflation, of a male worker 30 years earlier. A typical son, in other words, is earning less than his dad did at the same age.
This is what has happened with ordinary workers as the wealth at the top has soared into the stratosphere.
With so much of the middle class and the rest of working America tapped out, there is not enough consumer demand for the goods and services that the U.S. economy is capable of producing. Without that demand, there are precious few prospects for a robust recovery.
If matters stay the same, with working people perpetually struggling in an environment of ever-increasing economic insecurity and inequality, the very stability of the society will be undermined.
The U.S. economy needs to be rebalanced so that the benefits are shared more widely, more equitably. There are many ways to do this, but what is most important right now is to recognize this central fact, to focus on it and to begin seriously considering the most constructive options.

Full text: Last week Japan's minister of finance declared that he and his colleagues wanted a discussion with China about the latter's purchases of Japanese bonds, to "examine its intention" -- diplomat-speak for "Stop it right now." The news made me want to bang my head against the wall in frustration.
You see, senior American policy figures have repeatedly balked at doing anything about Chinese currency manipulation, at least in part out of fear that the Chinese would stop buying our bonds. Yet in the current environment, Chinese purchases of our bonds don't help us -- they hurt us. The Japanese understand that. Why don't we?
Some background: If discussion of Chinese currency policy seems confusing, it's only because many people don't want to face up to the stark, simple reality -- namely, that China is deliberately keeping its currency artificially weak.
The consequences of this policy are also stark and simple: in effect, China is taxing imports while subsidizing exports, feeding a huge trade surplus. You may see claims that China's trade surplus has nothing to do with its currency policy; if so, that would be a first in world economic history. An undervalued currency always promotes trade surpluses, and China is no different.
And in a depressed world economy, any country running an artificial trade surplus is depriving other nations of much-needed sales and jobs. Again, anyone who asserts otherwise is claiming that China is somehow exempt from the economic logic that has always applied to everyone else.
So what should we be doing? U.S. officials have tried to reason with their Chinese counterparts, arguing that a stronger currency would be in China's own interest. They're right about that: an undervalued currency promotes inflation, erodes the real wages of Chinese workers and squanders Chinese resources. But while currency manipulation is bad for China as a whole, it's good for politically influential Chinese companies -- many of them state-owned. And so the currency manipulation goes on.
Time and again, U.S. officials have announced progress on the currency issue; each time, it turns out that they've been had. Back in June, Timothy Geithner, the Treasury secretary, praised China's announcement that it would move to a more flexible exchange rate. Since then, the renminbi has risen a grand total of 1, that's right, 1 percent against the dollar -- with much of the rise taking place in just the past few days, ahead of planned Congressional hearings on the currency issue. And since the dollar has fallen against other major currencies, China's artificial cost advantage has actually increased.
Clearly, nothing will happen until or unless the United States shows that it's willing to do what it normally does when another country subsidizes its exports: impose a temporary tariff that offsets the subsidy. So why has such action never been on the table?
One answer, as I've already suggested, is fear of what would happen if the Chinese stopped buying American bonds. But this fear is completely misplaced: in a world awash with excess savings, we don't need China's money -- especially because the Federal Reserve could and should buy up any bonds the Chinese sell.
It's true that the dollar would fall if China decided to dump some American holdings. But this would actually help the U.S. economy, making our exports more competitive. Ask the Japanese, who want China to stop buying their bonds because those purchases are driving up the yen.
Aside from unjustified financial fears, there's a more sinister cause of U.S. passivity: business fear of Chinese retaliation.
Consider a related issue: the clearly illegal subsidies China provides to its clean-energy industry. These subsidies should have led to a formal complaint from American businesses; in fact, the only organization willing to file a complaint was the steelworkers union. Why? As The Times reported, "multinational companies and trade associations in the clean energy business, as in many other industries, have been wary of filing trade cases, fearing Chinese officials' reputation for retaliating against joint ventures in their country and potentially denying market access to any company that takes sides against China."
Similar intimidation has surely helped discourage action on the currency front. So this is a good time to remember that what's good for multinational companies is often bad for America, especially its workers.
So here's the question: Will U.S. policy makers let themselves be spooked by financial phantoms and bullied by business intimidation? Will they continue to do nothing in the face of policies that benefit Chinese special interests at the expense of both Chinese and American workers? Or will they finally, finally act? Stay tuned.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The global economic recession significantly pushed down purchases of weapons last year to the lowest level since 2005, a new government study has found.
The report to Congress concluded that the value of worldwide arms deals in 2009 was $57.5 billion, a drop of 8.5 percent from 2008.
While the United States maintained its role as the world's leading supplier of weapons, officials nonetheless saw the value of its arms trade sharply decline in 2009. This was in contrast to 2008, when the United States increased the value of its weapons sales despite a drop in business for competitors in the global arms bazaar.
For 2009, the United States signed arms deals worth $22.6 billion -- a dominating 39 percent of the worldwide market. Even so, that sales figure was down from $38.1 billion in 2008, which had been a surprising increase over the $25.7 billion in 2007 that defied sluggish economic trends.
The decrease in American weapons sales in 2009 was caused by a pause in major orders from clients in the Middle East and Asia, which had pumped up the value of contracts the year before. At the same time, there were fewer support and services contracts signed with American defense firms last year, the study said.
Russia was a distant second in worldwide weapons sales in 2009, concluding $10.4 billion in arms deals, followed by France, with $7.4 billion in contracts. Other leading arms traders included Germany, Italy, China and Britain.
The annual report was produced by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, a division of the Library of Congress. The analysis, regarded as the most detailed collection of unclassified global arms sales data available to the public, was delivered to members of the House and Senate over the weekend in advance of their return to work on Monday after the summer recess.
The decline in new weapons sales worldwide in 2009 was caused by government decisions "to defer the purchase of major systems" in a period of "severe international recession," wrote Richard F. Grimmett, a specialist in international security at the Congressional Research Service and the author of the study.
The recession did not halt military modernization and improvements, as nations sought to make their armed forces more lethal despite tight budgets.
"Some nations chose to focus on completing the integration into their militaries of major weapons systems they had already purchased," Mr. Grimmett wrote. Other nations, according to the study, focused available military money on smaller contracts for "training and support services, as well as selective upgrades of existing weapons systems."
Mr. Grimmett said that while the global recession slowed overall weapons sales, "The international arms market is still very competitive," with major weapons-producing nations battling over traditional clients and seeking new buyers in emerging markets.
To that end, the study focuses in particular on the category of weapons sales to the developing world, which totaled $45.1 billion of the overall arms trade in 2009, a drop from $48.8 billion in 2008.
In 2009, Brazil was the top weapons buyer in the developing world, concluding $7.2 billion in purchase contracts, followed by Venezuela with $6.4 billion in purchases and Saudi Arabia with $4.3 billion. Other major arms buyers last year were Taiwan, the United Arab Emirates, Iraq, Egypt, Vietnam, India and Kuwait.
Over much of the past decade, Saudi Arabia, China, India and the United Arab Emirates have been among the largest weapons purchasers in this category.
The United States led not only in global arms sales, but also in the category of weapons contracts to the developing world, signing deals worth $17.4 billion in arms to these nations in 2009. Russia was second, followed by France.
"Relationships between arms suppliers and recipients continue to evolve in the 21st century in response to changing political, military and economic circumstances," Mr. Grimmett concluded. "Where before the principal motivation for arms sales by foreign suppliers might have been to support a foreign policy objective, today that motivation may be based as much on economic considerations."
The study uses figures in 2009 dollars, with amounts for previous years adjusted for inflation to give a constant financial measurement.

Full text: HONG KONG -- For K. K. Lam, a 37-year-old accountant in Guangzhou, inflation means higher prices for pork and for vegetables like bok choy.
For Allen Dong, the sales manager for a home appliance manufacturer 700 miles to the northeast in Ningbo, inflation means trying to persuade retailers to pay more for dehumidifiers so his company can cover rising costs for wages and raw materials.
From street markets to corporate offices, consumers and executives alike in China are trying to cope with rising prices. The National Bureau of Statistics announced on Saturday that consumer prices in China were 3.5 percent higher compared with a year earlier, the largest increase in nearly two years.
To make matters worse, inflation over the short term also seems to be accelerating. A seasonally adjusted comparison of August prices to July prices showed that inflation was running at an annualized pace closer to 4.8 percent.
Prices are rising in China for reasons that many Americans or Europeans might envy. The economy is growing, stores are full and banks are lending lots of money, according to other statistics released by the government on Saturday. Compared with August of last year, industrial production rose 13.9 percent last month, retail sales increased 18.4 percent, bank lending climbed 18.6 percent and fixed-asset investment surged 24 percent.
All four categories rose slightly more than economists had expected, in the latest sign of the Chinese economy's strength even as recoveries seem to be flagging elsewhere.
Separate data released on Friday by the General Administration of Customs showed that Chinese demand for imports also remained surprisingly strong. The trade surplus narrowed to $20 billion last month, and would have been nearly in balance without China's $18 billion surplus with the United States.
But so much cash in the Chinese economy chasing a limited volume of goods is pushing up prices. Inflation is starting to become troublesome, especially for young people entering the work force and retirees on fixed incomes.
Young people with vocational school degrees typically earn $200 to $300 a month in factories near the coast these days, and somewhat less in the Chinese interior. Rising prices have prompted many to ask for bigger paychecks, and blue-collar incomes have increased faster than inflation.
But salaries for recent college graduates, at $300 to $500 a month in coastal areas, have actually declined in the last few years, even before adjusting for inflation. A rapid expansion of universities over the last decade has resulted in more young men and women with undergraduate degrees than companies are ready to hire, except at lower pay.
And as in many countries, retirees are among the most vulnerable to inflation. Ms. Lam said her own mother lived on a pension of just $150 a month.
Rising wages are putting pressure on companies to increase their prices. Mr. Dong, the sales manager at the Ningbo Deye Domestic Electrical Appliance Technology Company, said the company had to raise wages by 10 percent a year, while raw material costs were also climbing.
"It is impossible to transfer our cost increases entirely to our customers, because if we do so, they will all run away," he said. "We are currently doing a study of our assembly line work processes to see where we can achieve greater efficiency."
But as the powerful growth in fixed-asset investment last month showed, Chinese companies are still responding to rising prices by building more factories, office buildings and other equipment, instead of cutting back.
Pan Ning, the sales manager at the Newsunda Industries Company, a manufacturer of school bags and pocket calculators based in Shantou, said labor and raw material prices had been climbing by 5 to 10 percent. But as school years have begun around the world in the Northern Hemisphere, Newsunda has been able to raise the prices it charges to cover the increased costs, Ms. Pan said.
Chinese officials have said for many years that they regard 5 percent inflation as unacceptable, and they have shown a willingness to clamp down on bank lending and investment whenever annual increases come close to that level. They have taken some of these steps in recent months, but more recently eased back on lending controls as some Chinese economists suggested that domestic demand might not be as strong as the August data showed.
For now, many Chinese consumers are irked by rising prices for everyday necessities.
"I honestly don't know how young people starting out in the work world manage," Ms. Lam said. They pay nearly half their salaries for their own room in a shared apartment in a bad neighborhood, she said, "and if you add in food and transportation, there will be nothing extra left in your salary to send home."

A JAPANESE POWER BROKER

Full text: HONG KONG -- A surprisingly large increase in imports caused China's trade surplus to narrow in August, data released Friday showed.
But at $20 billion, the surplus remains a huge bone of contention in relations with the United States, which has long argued that the renminbi's value has been kept low, giving Chinese companies a competitive advantage over American manufacturers.
The trade statistics showed the pace of Chinese export growth moderating from the previous month -- though a rise of 34.4 percent from a year earlier was robust and in line with analysts' expectations.
But economists were surprised by the size of the growth in China's imports -- up 35.2 percent from August 2009. That appeared to signal that domestic demand had rebounded despite Beijing's efforts in recent months to rein in the pace of Chinese economic growth and to slow the inflationary pressures that had built up as a result.
China's government is scheduled to release additional economic data, including the latest inflation figures, on Saturday.
In the Friday data, the combination of somewhat slower export growth and strong imports caused the Chinese trade surplus to shrink much more than expected. At $20 billion, the August surplus was well below the $28.7 billion recorded in July.
But looking at the national breakdown, economists noted that China's trade surplus with the United States was still the second-largest at $18.1 billion, though down by $1.3 billion. Analysts said the slight narrowing of that trade gap was unlikely to stop American policy makers from calling on China to let the renminbi rise against the dollar. On the other hand, the softer pace of export growth might stiffen the resolve of Beijing to resist pressures for a stronger renminbi.
In June, China said it would allow more flexibility in the renminbi's exchange rate with the dollar, but the rise in the renminbi so far has been minimal -- to 6.77 renminbi to the dollar Friday from about 6.83 renminbi in June.
"As political frictions ramp up ahead of the U.S. midterm election, expect every nuanced movement in China's deficit to be used by both Beijing and Washington to further their stance on the reminibi," economists at HSBC wrote in a note.
The picture is further clouded by uncertainties over how the global economy -- and Chinese exporting prowess and import demand -- will develop in coming months.
Some economists say the rise in imports shows that the authorities are easing off the brake pedal. Analysts at Goldman Sachs wrote in a note, "We have been highlighting over the past month that there has been a stealth loosening of policy since July, which probably started to show its impact on economic data in August."
Others, however, cautioned that import growth would moderate again in coming months, bringing a renewed widening of the trade surplus.
"We expect both export and import growth to return to a downward trend," two economists at Citibank, Ken Peng and Minggao Shen, said in a note Friday. "Imports cannot far outpace exports sustainably, especially when domestic policies remain on a tightening tilt."

Full text: Oracle's boss, Lawrence Ellison, may have unwittingly given Hewlett-Packard some brilliant advice. Before snatching Mark V. Hurd to help run his software company this week, Mr. Ellison called the board's parting ways with the H.P. chief executive "the worst personnel decision since the idiots on the Apple board fired Steve Jobs."
Extend Mr. Ellison's logic, and Apple could provide sort of a blueprint for getting H.P. back on track. After Mr. Jobs lost a power struggle at the company he co-founded, Apple brought him back about a decade later. It could be time for H.P.'s own Jobsian moment.
The company letterhead provides the inspiration. Bill Hewlett and David Packard met while they were undergraduates at Stanford and built their first product, a resistance-capacitance audio oscillator, in a garage in Palo Alto, Calif., with initial capital of $538. The trouble is, both men are deceased.
There is still a good related option: Hewlett's son Walter. True, he is known in Silicon Valley primarily as a musician and an academic, having founded the Center for Computer Assisted Research in the Humanities at Stanford. But he has displayed remarkably good business judgment and a passion for his father's company.
Mr. Hewlett led a 2002 shareholder campaign against the chief executive, Carly Fiorina, and her $24 billion takeover of Compaq. That deal, as Mr. Hewlett rightly predicted, plunged H.P. further into the commoditized PC business and hurt profit margins, ultimately leading to Ms. Fiorina's departure and Mr. Hurd's appointment.
Now, H.P.'s board needs a major shake-up. It had already shown dubious judgment over a witch hunt to uncover information leaks. Now it has overreacted to "l'affaire Hurd," and compounded the error by failing to ensure that his departure would not hurt the company. A rearguard legal effort to restrain Mr. Hurd has come too late: the stock has lost $17.5 billion of value since he resigned. By contrast, Oracle's is unchanged.
Mr. Hewlett is no operations man, and his H.P. tenure ended bitterly. But he is an experienced corporate director, knows the company and, above all, carries the spirit of invention and enterprise -- the very essence of Silicon Valley's past half-century -- that inspired the company's founders. It is hard to see better qualities for a new chairman.
Cheap Stocks
Successful long-term investors buy good assets when nobody wants them, and sell when the risk-averse pile in. Bonds are considered to be havens today, after the stock market's lost decade. That could be about to reverse; the great bull market in government bonds is probably over.
Since 1982, when runaway inflation was going to destroy capital, if not capitalism itself, bond investors who took the risk that the beast would be tamed have been hugely rewarded. But the opportunity to buy 10-year Treasuries with a 14 percent yield followed a bear market that had wiped out the value of fixed-interest securities.
Companies had shown more resilience to rising inflation, so around 1960 in the United States, Britain, Germany and Japan, the "yield gap" between government bonds and shares was reversed. For the next half-century, the dividend yield on shares was below that on government bonds. Until now.
In Britain, Germany and Japan, shares now yield more than government debt. In the United States, the gap has shrunk to around 0.3 percent. This, says Citigroup, is the end of the cult of the equity -- extinguished by two 50 percent bear markets (after the dot-com mania and then the credit bubble), a glut of equity issuance and the flight of pension funds from shares to bonds.
Yet funds are buying bonds because they (or their advisers) deem them low-risk, not because they believe them to be inexpensive. Today's bond prices signal that inflation will not return for at least a decade, despite sustained and determined efforts from the world's central banks to stimulate it.
The risk that central banks will succeed is not priced into bonds while the risk that they will not -- and that economies will stagnate (or worse) -- is priced into stocks. Yet companies have rebuilt their balance sheets after the crisis, and despite sluggish top-line growth, dividends -- the unsung, vital part of long-term performance -- look sustainable.
Many companies are even raising their payouts. The FTSE 100 embraces a fair cross section of world shares. Evolution Securities estimates its forward yield at 3.8 percent, while 10-year British gilts return 3 percent. Such inversions are extremely rare -- as rare as the best opportunities to buy good assets cheaply.

Full text: Of all the uncertainties in our halting economic recovery, the housing market may be the most confusing of all.
At times, real estate seems to be in the early stages of a severe double dip. Home sales plunged in July, and some analysts are now predicting that the market will struggle for years, if not decades.
Others argue that the worst is over. As Karl Case, the eminent real estate economist (and the Case in the Case-Shiller price index), recently wrote, "Buying a house now can make a lot of sense."
I can't claim to clear up all the uncertainty. But I do want to suggest a framework for figuring out whether you lean bearish or less bearish: do you believe that housing is a luxury good and that societies spend more on it as they get richer? Or do you think it's more like food, clothing and other staples that account for an ever smaller share of consumer spending over time?
If you believe housing resembles a luxury good, then you'll end up thinking house prices will rise nearly as fast as incomes in the long run and that houses today aren't terribly overvalued. If housing is a staple, though, prices will rise more slowly -- with general inflation, as food tends to.
The difference between these two views ends up being huge, and it's become the subject of an intriguing debate.
After digging into it, I come down closer to the luxury good side, which is to say the less bearish one. To me, housing does not rank with unemployment, the trade deficit, the budget deficit or consumer debt as one of the economy's biggest problems. But you may disagree.

No one doubts that prices rose roughly with incomes from 1970 to 2000. The issue is whether that period was an exception. Housing bears like Barry Ritholtz, an investment researcher and popular blogger, say it was. The government was adding new tax breaks for homeownership, and interest rates were falling. These trends won't repeat themselves, the bears say.
As evidence, they can point to a historical data series collected by Mr. Case's longtime collaborator, Robert Shiller. It suggests that house prices rose no faster than inflation for much of the last century.
The pattern makes some intuitive sense, too. As people become richer, they spend a shrinking share of their income on the basics. Think of it this way: someone who gets a big raise doesn't usually spend it on groceries. You can see how shelter seems as if it might also qualify as a staple and, like food, would account for a shrinking share of consumer spending over time. In that case, house prices should rise at about the same rate as general inflation and well below incomes.
Here's the scary thing, at least for homeowners: if this view is correct, house prices may still be overvalued by something like 30 percent. That's roughly the gap between average household income growth and inflation over the last generation.
It's also the overvaluation suggested by Mr. Shiller's historical index. Today, it is around 130, which is way down from the 2006 bubble peak of 203. But it's still far above the 1890 to 1970 average of 94.
In effect, the bears are arguing that housing was in a multidecade bubble and has now entered a multidecade slump.
The second, less bearish group of economists doesn't buy this. This group includes Mr. Case, Mark Zandi of Moody's Analytics and Tom Lawler, a Virginia economist who forecast the end of the housing boom before many others did. They say they believe that house prices rise nearly as fast, if not quite as fast, as incomes, and that real estate is no longer in a bubble.
This side can also make a case based on history. Mr. Case points out that all pre-1970 housing statistics are suspect. By necessity, Mr. Shiller's oft-cited historical index is a patchwork that relies on several sources, like Labor Department surveys. These sources happen to paint a more negative picture of past house prices than some other data.
For example, the Census Bureau has been asking people since 1940 how much they think their houses are worth, as Mr. Lawler noted in one of his newsletters. The answers suggest that house values rose faster than general inflation -- and about as fast as incomes -- not just from 1970 to 2000, but from 1940 to 1970, as well.
Likewise, Mr. Case has dug up sales records for houses in the Boston area that were built in the late 19th century and are still around. The records show prices rising 2.5 percentage points a year faster than inflation, which is just about what income has done.
Perhaps most persuasive is a statistic that Mr. Shiller sent me when I asked him about this debate. It shows that the share of consumer spending -- and, by extension, of income -- devoted to housing has not fallen over time. It has hovered around 14 or 15 percent for the last 60 years. The share of spending devoted to food, by contrast, has dropped to 13 percent, from 25 percent.
These numbers make a pretty strong argument that the post-1970 period is not one long aberration. As societies get richer, they do spend more and more on housing.
Some of this spending, Mr. Shiller notes, comes in the form of bigger, more expensive houses. These houses don't do anything to lift the value of a smaller, older house -- which is what matters to individual homeowners. But McMansions are not the only factor.
To see this, you can look at the share of consumer spending devoted to things inside houses, like furniture. As with houses, they have become fancier. But they haven't become so much fancier that they make up anywhere near as large a share of consumer spending today as in the past. That's a strong clue that the upgrading of houses themselves isn't enough to explain the increased spending on housing.
What is? The value of the underlying land. Those Boston-area houses that Mr. Case studied did not change much over time. Yet their value did.
For a house whose location has any value -- in a major city or a nearby suburb, where a builder can't simply put up a similar house down the street -- the land is a big part of the equation. Over time, Mr. Zandi says, the value of that land should grow almost as fast as the local area's economic output or, in other words, with incomes.
The best advice for homeowners and would-be buyers may be to think of a house not as an investment, first and foremost, but as a place to live. If there is a good chance you will move in the next three years or so, you should probably rent. The hassles of buying and the one-time costs are just too big. Plus, house prices are not low in most places today.
The ratio of median house price to income is about 3.4, compared with a prebubble average of about 3.2. Given the economy's weak condition and the still high number of foreclosures, prices may well fall more in the next year or two. They look especially high in places where rents are comparatively cheap, like San Diego and San Francisco. And maybe income growth will remain weak for years, holding down home-price growth.
But if you can imagine staying much longer than a few years, you should take some comfort in the fact that the bubble seems mostly deflated. Sometime soon, prices should begin rising again. They may not quite keep up with incomes, but they will probably outpace the price of food and clothing.
Now, if only it were possible to be as sanguine about the economy's other problems.

Obama Offers A Transit Plan To Create Jobs

Full text: MILWAUKEE -- President Obama, looking to stimulate a sluggish economy and create jobs, called Monday for Congress to approve major upgrades to the nation's roads, rail lines and runways -- part of a six-year plan that would cost tens of billions of dollars and create a government-run bank to finance innovative transportation projects.
With Democrats facing an increasingly bleak midterm election season, Mr. Obama used a speech at a union gathering on Labor Day, the traditional start of the campaign season, to outline his plan. It calls for a quick infusion of $50 billion in government spending that White House officials said could spur job growth as early as next year -- if Congress approves.
That is a big if. Though transportation bills usually win bipartisan support, hasty passage of Mr. Obama's plan seems unlikely, given that Congress has only a few weeks of work left before lawmakers return to their districts to campaign and that Republicans are showing little interest in giving Democrats any pre-election victories.
Central to the plan is the president's call for an "infrastructure bank," which would be run by the government but would pool tax dollars with private investment, the White House says. Mr. Obama embraced the idea as a senator; with unemployment still high despite an array of government efforts, the concept has lately been gaining traction in policy circles and on Capitol Hill.
Indeed, some leading proponents of such a bank -- including Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, Republican of California; Gov. Ed Rendell, Democrat of Pennsylvania; and Michael R. Bloomberg, the independent mayor of New York -- would like to see it finance a broader range of projects, including water and clean-energy projects. They say such a bank would spur innovation by allowing a panel of experts to approve projects on merit, rather than having lawmakers simply steer transportation money back home.
"It will change the way Washington spends your tax dollars," Mr. Obama said here, "reforming the haphazard and patchwork way we fund and maintain our infrastructure to focus less on wasteful earmarks and outdated formulas, and more on competition and innovation that gives us the best bang for the buck."
But the notion of a government-run bank -- indeed, a government-run anything -- is bound to prove contentious during an election year in which voters are furious over bank bailouts and over what many perceive as Mr. Obama pursuing a big government agenda. Even before the announcement Monday, Republicans were expressing caution.
"It's important to keep in mind that increased spending -- no matter the method of delivery -- is not free," said Representative Pat Tiberi, an Ohio Republican who is on a Ways and Means subcommittee that held hearings on the bank this year. He warned that "federally guaranteed borrowing and lending could place taxpayers on the hook should the proposed bank fail."
The announcement comes after weeks of scrambling by a White House desperate to give a jolt to the lackluster recovery, and is part of a broader package of proposals that Mr. Obama intends to introduce on Wednesday during a speech in Cleveland. The transportation initiative would revise and extend legislation that has lapsed.
Specifically, the president wants to rebuild 150,000 miles of road, lay and maintain 4,000 miles of rail track, restore 150 miles of runways and advance a next-generation air-traffic control system.
The White House did not offer a price tag for the full measure or say how many jobs it would create. If Congress simply reauthorized the expired transportation bill and accounted for inflation, the new measure would cost about $350 billion over the next six years. But Mr. Obama wants to "frontload" the new bill with an additional $50 billion in initial investment to generate jobs, and vowed it would be "fully paid for." The White House is proposing to offset the $50 billion by eliminating tax breaks and subsidies for the oil and gas industry.
After months of campaigning on the theme that the president's $787 billion stimulus package was wasteful, Republicans sought Monday to tag the new plan with the stimulus label. The Republican National Committee called it "stimulus deja vu," and Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the House Republican whip, characterized it as "yet another government stimulus effort."
But Governors Rendell and Schwarzenegger, and Mayor Bloomberg, who in 2008 founded a bipartisan coalition to promote transportation upgrades, praised Mr. Obama. And in policy circles, the plan, especially the call for the infrastructure bank, is generating serious debate.
"This is a very ripe policy question now," said Robert Puentes, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution's Metropolitan Policy Program, who has been working for several years on blueprints for a bank.
On Capitol Hill, Representatives James L. Oberstar, Democrat of Minnesota and chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, has been developing his own bill, as has Representative Rosa DeLauro, Democrat of Connecticut.
Ms. DeLauro's plan would create an infrastructure bank that would be part of the United States Treasury, where it would attract money from institutional investors, then channel the funds to projects selected by a panel. The program, which would make loans much like the World Bank, would finance projects with the potential to transform whole regions, or even the national economy, the way the interstate highway system and the first transcontinental railway once did.
The outside investors would expect a competitive return on their money, so many of the completed projects would have to charge fees, taxes or tolls. In an interview, Ms. DeLauro said she would be "looking at a broader base," meaning the bank would finance not just roads and rails, but also telecommunications, water, drainage, green energy and other large-scale works.
But if the projects did not raise enough money, the Treasury might get stuck paying back the investors, a prospect that gave pause to so-called deficit hawks like Mr. Tiberi. In an e-mail last week, he said he agreed the nation's road and communications networks needed to be improved but was concerned about creating another company like Fannie Mae that might need a bailout.
Inside the White House, the idea for a transportation initiative, and in particular an infrastructure bank, is one that the White House chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, has been promoting. It was not included in the original $787 billion stimulus program because the administration and Congressional Democratic leaders wanted to pass that package as quickly as possible.
There is no shortage of projects in search of money. The problem, analysts say, is that Congress, which would create the bank, is not known for its ability to single out strategic priorities for growth. Instead, it traditionally builds broad support by giving a little something to everybody -- Montana, for instance, would get a small amount of Amtrak money in return for its support for improvements along the Northeast corridor.
"We don't prioritize," Mr. Puentes said. "We take this kind of peanut butter approach of spreading investment dollars around very thinly, without targeting them."
Samuel Staley, director of urban growth and land-use policy for the Reason Foundation, a libertarian research group, said the best way to spend money efficiently would be to establish the bank as a revolving loan fund so that money for new projects would not become available until money for previous projects had been repaid.
Mr. Staley expressed concern that in their zeal to spur growth and create jobs, Congress and the Obama administration would not impose such limits.
"With the $800 billion stimulus program, they were literally just dumping money into the economy," he said. "There was little legitimate cost-benefit analysis."

Full text: Ithaca, N.Y
TODAY we celebrate the American labor force, but this year's working-class celebrity hero made his debut almost a month ago. Steven Slater, a flight attendant for JetBlue, ended his career by cursing at his passengers over the intercom and grabbing a couple of beers before sliding down the emergency-evacuation chute -- and into popular history.
The press immediately drew parallels between Mr. Slater's outburst and two iconic moments of 1970s popular culture: Howard Beale's "I'm mad as hell" rant from the 1976 film "Network" and Johnny Paycheck's 1977 anthem of alienation, "Take This Job and Shove It."
But these are more than just parallels: those late '70s events are part of the cultural foundation of our own time. Less expressions of rebellion than frustration, they mark the final days of a time when the working class actually mattered.
The '70s began on a remarkably hopeful -- and militant -- note. Working-class discontent was epidemic: 2.4 million people engaged in major strikes in 1970 alone, all struggling with what Fortune magazine called an "angry, aggressive and acquisitive" mood in the shops.
Most workers weren't angry over wages, though, but rather the quality of their jobs. Pundits often called it "Lordstown syndrome," after the General Motors plant in Ohio where a young, hip and interracial group of workers held a three-week strike in 1972. The workers weren't concerned about better pay; instead, they wanted more control over what was then the fastest assembly line in the world.
Newsweek called the strike an "industrial Woodstock," an upheaval in employment relations akin to the cultural upheavals of the 1960s. The "blue-collar blues" were so widespread that the Senate opened an investigation into worker "alienation."
But what felt to some like radical change in the heartland was really the beginning of the end -- not just of organized labor's influence, but of the very presence of workers in national civic life.
When the economy soured in 1974, business executives dismissed workers' complaints about the quality of their occupational life -- and then went gunning for their paychecks and their unions as well, abetted by a conservative political climate and the offshoring of the nation's industrial core. Inflation, not unemployment, became Public Enemy No. 1, and workers bore the political costs of the fight against it.
Though direct workplace confrontations quickly dropped off, the feelings that had fueled them did not. Analysts began talking of an "inner class war" -- more psychological than material, more anxious than angry, more about self-worth than occupational justice.
"Something's happening to people like me," Dewey Burton, an assembly-line worker for Ford, told The Times in 1974. "More and more of us are sort of leaving our hopes outside in the rain and coming into the house and just locking the door -- you know, just turning the key and 'click,' that's it for what we always thought we could be."
Johnny Paycheck, a country singer, understood. Throngs of working-class people may have gathered around jukeboxes to raise a glass and chant the famous chorus to his most famous song, but they knew that his urge to rebellion was really just a fantasy: "I'd give the shirt right off of my back / If I had the nerve to say / Take this job and shove it!"
Similarly, in "Network," Howard Beale, a TV news anchor played by Peter Finch, became famous as "the mad prophet of the airwaves." But while he and his audiences may have been yelling, "I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not going to take this anymore!" the tag line was more a psychological release than a call to arms. After all, at the end of the film, Beale, already in suicidal despair, is murdered by his employer for meddling with the system.
The overt class conflict of the late '70s ended a while ago. Workers have learned to internalize and mask powerlessness, but the internal frustration and struggle remain. Any questions about quality of work life, the animating issue of 1970s unrest, have long since disappeared -- despite the flat-lining of wages in the decades since. Today the concerns of the working class have less space in our civic imagination than at any time since the Industrial Revolution.
Occasionally a rebel shatters the silence. Like Steven Slater, though, they get more publicity than political traction. Many things about America have changed since the late '70s, but the soundtrack of working-class life, sadly, remains the same.

Full text: Here's the situation: The U.S. economy has been crippled by a financial crisis. The president's policies have limited the damage, but they were too cautious, and unemployment remains disastrously high. More action is clearly needed. Yet the public has soured on government activism, and seems poised to deal Democrats a severe defeat in the midterm elections.
The president in question is Franklin Delano Roosevelt; the year is 1938. Within a few years, of course, the Great Depression was over. But it's both instructive and discouraging to look at the state of America circa 1938 -- instructive because the nature of the recovery that followed refutes the arguments dominating today's public debate, discouraging because it's hard to see anything like the miracle of the 1940s happening again.
Now, we weren't supposed to find ourselves replaying the late 1930s. President Obama's economists promised not to repeat the mistakes of 1937, when F.D.R. pulled back fiscal stimulus too soon. But by making his program too small and too short-lived, Mr. Obama did just that: the stimulus raised growth while it lasted, but it made only a small dent in unemployment -- and now it's fading out.
And just as some of us feared, the inadequacy of the administration's initial economic plan has landed it -- and the nation -- in a political trap. More stimulus is desperately needed, but in the public's eyes the failure of the initial program to deliver a convincing recovery has discredited government action to create jobs.
In short, welcome to 1938.
The story of 1937, of F.D.R.'s disastrous decision to heed those who said that it was time to slash the deficit, is well known. What's less well known is the extent to which the public drew the wrong conclusions from the recession that followed: far from calling for a resumption of New Deal programs, voters lost faith in fiscal expansion.
Consider Gallup polling from March 1938. Asked whether government spending should be increased to fight the slump, 63 percent of those polled said no. Asked whether it would be better to increase spending or to cut business taxes, only 15 percent favored spending; 63 percent favored tax cuts. And the 1938 election was a disaster for the Democrats, who lost 70 seats in the House and seven in the Senate.
Then came the war.
From an economic point of view World War II was, above all, a burst of deficit-financed government spending, on a scale that would never have been approved otherwise. Over the course of the war the federal government borrowed an amount equal to roughly twice the value of G.D.P. in 1940 -- the equivalent of roughly $30 trillion today.
Had anyone proposed spending even a fraction that much before the war, people would have said the same things they're saying today. They would have warned about crushing debt and runaway inflation. They would also have said, rightly, that the Depression was in large part caused by excess debt -- and then have declared that it was impossible to fix this problem by issuing even more debt.
But guess what? Deficit spending created an economic boom -- and the boom laid the foundation for long-run prosperity. Overall debt in the economy -- public plus private -- actually fell as a percentage of G.D.P., thanks to economic growth and, yes, some inflation, which reduced the real value of outstanding debts. And after the war, thanks to the improved financial position of the private sector, the economy was able to thrive without continuing deficits.
The economic moral is clear: when the economy is deeply depressed, the usual rules don't apply. Austerity is self-defeating: when everyone tries to pay down debt at the same time, the result is depression and deflation, and debt problems grow even worse. And conversely, it is possible -- indeed, necessary -- for the nation as a whole to spend its way out of debt: a temporary surge of deficit spending, on a sufficient scale, can cure problems brought on by past excesses.
But the story of 1938 also shows how hard it is to apply these insights. Even under F.D.R., there was never the political will to do what was needed to end the Great Depression; its eventual resolution came essentially by accident.
I had hoped that we would do better this time. But it turns out that politicians and economists alike have spent decades unlearning the lessons of the 1930s, and are determined to repeat all the old mistakes. And it's slightly sickening to realize that the big winners in the midterm elections are likely to be the very people who first got us into this mess, then did everything in their power to block action to get us out.
But always remember: this slump can be cured. All it will take is a little bit of intellectual clarity, and a lot of political will. Here's hoping we find those virtues in the not too distant future.

Abstract: If you were, say, reading The Wall Street Journal's opinion pages in early 2009, you would have been repeatedly informed that the Obama plan would lead to skyrocketing interest rates and soaring inflation. The economic theory behind the Obama stimulus has passed the test of recent events with flying colors; unfortunately, Mr. Obama, for whatever reason -- yes, I'm aware that there were political constraints -- initially offered a plan that was much too cautious given the scale of the economy's problems.

Full text: Next week, President Obama is scheduled to propose new measures to boost the economy. I hope they're bold and substantive, since the Republicans will oppose him regardless -- if he came out for motherhood, the G.O.P. would declare motherhood un-American. So he should put them on the spot for standing in the way of real action.
But let's put politics aside and talk about what we've actually learned about economic policy over the past 20 months.
When Mr. Obama first proposed $800 billion in fiscal stimulus, there were two groups of critics. Both argued that unemployment would stay high -- but for very different reasons.
One group -- the group that got almost all the attention -- declared that the stimulus was much too large, and would lead to disaster. If you were, say, reading The Wall Street Journal's opinion pages in early 2009, you would have been repeatedly informed that the Obama plan would lead to skyrocketing interest rates and soaring inflation.
The other group, which included yours truly, warned that the plan was much too small given the economic forecasts then available. As I pointed out in February 2009, the Congressional Budget Office was predicting a $2.9 trillion hole in the economy over the next two years; an $800 billion program, partly consisting of tax cuts that would have happened anyway, just wasn't up to the task of filling that hole.
Critics in the second camp were particularly worried about what would happen this year, since the stimulus would have its maximum effect on growth in late 2009 then gradually fade out. Last year, many of us were already warning that the economy might stall in the second half of 2010.
So what actually happened? The administration's optimistic forecast was wrong, but which group of pessimists was right about the reasons for that error?
Start with interest rates. Those who said the stimulus was too big predicted sharply rising rates. When rates rose in early 2009, The Wall Street Journal published an editorial titled "The Bond Vigilantes: The disciplinarians of U.S. policy makers return." The editorial declared that it was all about fear of deficits, and concluded, "When in doubt, bet on the markets."
But those who said the stimulus was too small argued that temporary deficits weren't a problem as long as the economy remained depressed; we were awash in savings with nowhere to go. Interest rates, we said, would fluctuate with optimism or pessimism about future growth, not with government borrowing.
When in doubt, bet on the markets. The 10-year bond rate was over 3.7 percent when The Journal published that editorial; it's under 2.7 percent now.
What about inflation? Amid the inflation hysteria of early 2009, the inadequate-stimulus critics pointed out that inflation always falls during sustained periods of high unemployment, and that this time should be no different. Sure enough, key measures of inflation have fallen from more than 2 percent before the economic crisis to 1 percent or less now, and Japanese-style deflation is looking like a real possibility.
Meanwhile, the timing of recent economic growth strongly supports the notion that stimulus does, indeed, boost the economy: growth accelerated last year, as the stimulus reached its predicted peak impact, but has fallen off -- just as some of us feared -- as the stimulus has faded.
Oh, and don't tell me that Germany proves that austerity, not stimulus, is the way to go. Germany actually did quite a lot of stimulus -- the austerity is all in the future. Also, it never had a housing bubble that burst. And with all that, German G.D.P. is still further below its precrisis peak than American G.D.P. True, Germany has done better in terms of employment -- but that's because strong unions and government policy have prevented American-style mass layoffs.
The actual lessons of 2009-2010, then, are that scare stories about stimulus are wrong, and that stimulus works when it is applied. But it wasn't applied on a sufficient scale. And we need another round.
I know that getting that round is unlikely: Republicans and conservative Democrats won't stand for it. And if, as expected, the G.O.P. wins big in November, this will be widely regarded as a vindication of the anti-stimulus position. Mr. Obama, we'll be told, moved too far to the left, and his Keynesian economic doctrine was proved wrong.
But politics determines who has the power, not who has the truth. The economic theory behind the Obama stimulus has passed the test of recent events with flying colors; unfortunately, Mr. Obama, for whatever reason -- yes, I'm aware that there were political constraints -- initially offered a plan that was much too cautious given the scale of the economy's problems.
So, as I said, here's hoping that Mr. Obama goes big next week. If he does, he'll have the facts on his side.

THIS promises to be the worst Labor Day in the memory of most Americans. Organized labor is down to about 7 percent of the private work force. Members of non-organized labor -- most of the rest of us -- are unemployed, underemployed or underwater. Friday's jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics will almost surely show fewer new jobs created in August than the 125,000 needed just to keep up with growth of the potential work force.
The national economy isn't escaping the gravitational pull of the Great Recession. None of the standard booster rockets are working: near-zero short-term interest rates from the Fed, almost record-low borrowing costs in the bond market, a giant stimulus package and tax credits for small businesses that hire the long-term unemployed have all failed to do enough.
That's because the real problem has to do with the structure of the economy, not the business cycle. No booster rocket can work unless consumers are able, at some point, to keep the economy moving on their own. But consumers no longer have the purchasing power to buy the goods and services they produce as workers; for some time now, their means haven't kept up with what the growing economy could and should have been able to provide them.
This crisis began decades ago when a new wave of technology -- things like satellite communications, container ships, computers and eventually the Internet -- made it cheaper for American employers to use low-wage labor abroad or labor-replacing software here at home than to continue paying the typical worker a middle-class wage. Even though the American economy kept growing, hourly wages flattened. The median male worker earns less today, adjusted for inflation, than he did 30 years ago.
But for years American families kept spending as if their incomes were keeping pace with overall economic growth. And their spending fueled continued growth. How did families manage this trick? First, women streamed into the paid work force. By the late 1990s, more than 60 percent of mothers with young children worked outside the home (in 1966, only 24 percent did).
Second, everyone put in more hours. What families didn't receive in wage increases they made up for in work increases. By the mid-2000s, the typical male worker was putting in roughly 100 hours more each year than two decades before, and the typical female worker about 200 hours more.
When American families couldn't squeeze any more income out of these two coping mechanisms, they embarked on a third: going ever deeper into debt. This seemed painless -- as long as home prices were soaring. From 2002 to 2007, American households extracted $2.3 trillion from their homes.
Eventually, of course, the debt bubble burst -- and with it, the last coping mechanism. Now we're left to deal with the underlying problem that we've avoided for decades. Even if nearly everyone was employed, the vast middle class still wouldn't have enough money to buy what the economy is capable of producing.
Where have all the economic gains gone? Mostly to the top. The economists Emmanuel Saez and Thomas Piketty examined tax returns from 1913 to 2008. They discovered an interesting pattern. In the late 1970s, the richest 1 percent of American families took in about 9 percent of the nation's total income; by 2007, the top 1 percent took in 23.5 percent of total income.
It's no coincidence that the last time income was this concentrated was in 1928. I do not mean to suggest that such astonishing consolidations of income at the top directly cause sharp economic declines. The connection is more subtle.
The rich spend a much smaller proportion of their incomes than the rest of us. So when they get a disproportionate share of total income, the economy is robbed of the demand it needs to keep growing and creating jobs.
What's more, the rich don't necessarily invest their earnings and savings in the American economy; they send them anywhere around the globe where they'll summon the highest returns -- sometimes that's here, but often it's the Cayman Islands, China or elsewhere. The rich also put their money into assets most likely to attract other big investors (commodities, stocks, dot-coms or real estate), which can become wildly inflated as a result.
Meanwhile, as the economy grows, the vast majority in the middle naturally want to live better. Their consequent spending fuels continued growth and creates enough jobs for almost everyone, at least for a time. But because this situation can't be sustained, at some point -- 1929 and 2008 offer ready examples -- the bill comes due.
This time around, policymakers had knowledge their counterparts didn't have in 1929; they knew they could avoid immediate financial calamity by flooding the economy with money. But, paradoxically, averting another Great Depression-like calamity removed political pressure for more fundamental reform. We're left instead with a long and seemingly endless Great Jobs Recession.
THE Great Depression and its aftermath demonstrate that there is only one way back to full recovery: through more widely shared prosperity. In the 1930s, the American economy was completely restructured. New Deal measures -- Social Security, a 40-hour work week with time-and-a-half overtime, unemployment insurance, the right to form unions and bargain collectively, the minimum wage -- leveled the playing field.
In the decades after World War II, legislation like the G.I. Bill, a vast expansion of public higher education and civil rights and voting rights laws further reduced economic inequality. Much of this was paid for with a 70 percent to 90 percent marginal income tax on the highest incomes. And as America's middle class shared more of the economy's gains, it was able to buy more of the goods and services the economy could provide. The result: rapid growth and more jobs.
By contrast, little has been done since 2008 to widen the circle of prosperity. Health-care reform is an important step forward but it's not nearly enough.
What else could be done to raise wages and thereby spur the economy? We might consider, for example, extending the earned income tax credit all the way up through the middle class, and paying for it with a tax on carbon. Or exempting the first $20,000 of income from payroll taxes and paying for it with a payroll tax on incomes over $250,000.
In the longer term, Americans must be better prepared to succeed in the global, high-tech economy. Early childhood education should be more widely available, paid for by a small 0.5 percent fee on all financial transactions. Public universities should be free; in return, graduates would then be required to pay back 10 percent of their first 10 years of full-time income.
Another step: workers who lose their jobs and have to settle for positions that pay less could qualify for "earnings insurance" that would pay half the salary difference for two years; such a program would probably prove less expensive than extended unemployment benefits.
These measures would not enlarge the budget deficit because they would be paid for. In fact, such moves would help reduce the long-term deficits by getting more Americans back to work and the economy growing again.
Policies that generate more widely shared prosperity lead to stronger and more sustainable economic growth -- and that's good for everyone. The rich are better off with a smaller percentage of a fast-growing economy than a larger share of an economy that's barely moving. That's the Labor Day lesson we learned decades ago; until we remember it again, we'll be stuck in the Great Recession.

Full text: GAINESVILLE, Fla. -- He has a budget of almost $95 million, growing fast, and command of three private planes. He oversees a newly renovated and certified green building as well as nearly a dozen other tricked-out facilities that are among the most prized on campus.
Even as the University of Florida cuts faculty and budgets, its athletic director, Jeremy Foley, has been expanding a formidable empire dedicated to winning championships, not just in football and men's basketball but in 19 other sports.
The softball coach makes a quarter of a million dollars a year. When Foley decided to start a lacrosse program for women, he built a $15 million complex for them before they ever played a game.
This commitment to excellence is well rewarded. Among the incentives built into Foley's $1.2 million contract is a $50,000 bump for finishing in the top 10 of the Directors' Cup, a little-known but highly prized honor for the program with the most success across many sports. At stake is not just bragging rights, but hundreds of thousands of dollars in bonuses for athletic directors and coaches who feel increasing pressure to win.
Something has changed on many college campuses across America. As they seek to raise their profiles, universities are investing in once-obscure sports that do not come close to paying for themselves, even in the face of dire budget cuts. It's still not clear whether it pays off, but winning in all sports is what matters now, and the message is driven home from the highest levels of the university.
"If we are going to compete in something, we want to win at it -- whether it is in pediatrics or women's gymnastics," said J. Bernard Machen, the University of Florida president. "It is important to our supporters, both financial and among our community. It is part of our culture. We want people to know that Florida is a place for winners."
Some university officials and even athletic directors worry about whether the emphasis on athletics is worth the significant sums that universities invest in them.
"We talk about football coaches' salaries, we talk about basketball coaches' salaries," Gene Smith, Ohio State's athletic director, told his colleagues last year at a conference on spending in college athletics. "The salaries in many of our Olympic sports have tripled since 1994."
Sandy Barbour, at the University of California, Berkeley, said athletic directors do themselves a disservice by giving in to the spending race. "We haven't stopped and raised our hand and said, 'Whoa,' " said Barbour, who herself has faced criticism at Berkeley for subsidizing money-losing sports while the academic departments have been forced to make severe cuts.
All but 14 of the 120 athletic programs in the Football Bowl Subdivision -- the highest level of college sports -- lost money in the 2008-9 academic year, down from 25 profitable programs the year before, according to the N.C.A.A.
Still, overall spending on sports has increased among universities with big-time programs, according to the N.C.A.A. In 2008-9, athletic programs in the Football Bowl Subdivision increased their spending by nearly 11 percent over the previous year. At the same time, universities also increased their contribution to athletics, by 28 percent. That spending came even as the economic recession forced institutions to make painful cuts.
The reason, university officials say, is that the emphasis on sports pays off: athletics serve as the "front porch" of a university, a powerful marketing tool that generates free advertising on ESPN and the sports pages.
But economists have found it difficult to quantify a link between investing in a high-profile athletic program and reaping presumed benefits, like alumni donations or higher application rates. "If there's any effect, it's a blip: it doesn't persist," said Jonathan Orszag, an economist who has evaluated such issues for the N.C.A.A.
Still, even at colleges known more for academic excellence, hypercompetitive alumni want to be the best at everything.
"I think sports are part of the fabric of America, and colleges reflect that in a very positive way," said Richard McCarty, the provost at Vanderbilt University. "I do think that's a strong part of the connective tissue that holds many alumni, or allows them to stay connected to the home institution."
Budgets have risen, officials say, partly because more women are competing, and doing so under better conditions. Some larger universities are signing deals to televise not just football and basketball but also lesser-known sports. And they do not want viewers watching losing teams.
Another major factor is the Directors' Cup, which got its start in the 1990s during a brainstorming session as a way to raise the visibility of an association of athletic directors.
But it quickly gave rise to a competition among athletic directors to measure who had the best broad-based sports program. The cup's creators knew their idea had legs when Florida State flew one of them to Tallahassee to talk to coaches about the importance of scoring points.
"We were hoping that it was going to become a tool to measure one school against the other like it was originally designed to do," said Brian Horning, of the National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics, which runs the cup. "But we had no idea it would come into salary contracts and things like that."
Today, at least a dozen athletic directors at big-time sports programs receive bonuses that are tied to performance in the cup. Joe Alleva negotiated a bonus of $100,000 for every top-five finish by Louisiana State University. Ohio State's Smith may be concerned about the growing costs in minor sports, but he stands to collect a $17,000 bonus for a top-five finish, which he set as a goal for the Buckeyes.
And Barbour at Berkeley, which finished eighth this year, receives about $14,000 for a top-five ranking. "We've been in the top 10 now pretty consistently," she said, "and aspirationally, we want to win it."
Not only has the Directors' Cup become a lucrative benchmark for the success of athletic programs, it has become a slick enough marketing tool to give rise to an imitator. This week a team of former N.C.A.A. athletes unveiled the Capital One Cup, which will be awarded to the top men's and women's Division I programs based on cumulative on-field performance across multiple sports.
"This will be an opportunity for school administrators to see the importance of their nonrevenue programs," said Doug Flutie, the former Boston College and N.F.L. quarterback who won the 1984 Heisman Trophy. "On college campuses, the self-pride in those programs will continue to escalate."
The Price of Success
Foley, 57, who played lacrosse at Hobart College and has run the Boston Marathon, is competitive. He likes to see that quality in his coaches. He checks their recruiting logs to make sure they are on the road enough. In 2004 he fired the third-year football coach Ron Zook, and in 2001 he fired the baseball coach Andy Lopez. Lopez averaged 40 victories a season over seven seasons, winning two Southeastern Conference championships and appearing in five N.C.A.A. tournaments and two College World Series.
In Foley's 18-year tenure, Florida's teams have won 15 national championships and 95 SEC titles. "If the Directors' Cup went out of business tomorrow, we would not change a single thing we do," he said. "It is what we do here: we compete. It makes our work fun. It reflects positively on our institution."
The University of Florida is famous for its football and men's basketball teams. Urban Meyer and Billy Donovan, the football and basketball coaches, are among the nation's highest paid. Because those teams attract so many fans willing to pay for tickets and merchandise, they more than subsidize the rest of the teams, which lose money.
In fact, thanks to the success of those two teams, Florida's athletic program has contributed more than $55 million to the university for academics since 1990.
It was the performance, however, of those other teams that enabled Florida to place second to Stanford in the Directors' Cup earlier this year. It did not come cheaply.
Florida's spending on nearly every nonrevenue sport has more than doubled over the past decade, even after adjusting for inflation, according to financial documents reported annually to the N.C.A.A. Spending on women's gymnastics, swimming and track grew even faster.
Florida's more than 440 athletes are treated by a cadre of physiotherapists and monitored by an army of academic advisers. They practice and play in new facilities.
"Jeremy and everyone here truly believe that every athlete who steps onto this campus should be afforded the same resources, the same opportunities and same experiences as Tim Tebow," said the lacrosse coach, Amanda O'Leary, referring to the Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback.
Stanford, the perennial winner of the Directors' Cup, captures it with scale: it has 35 programs from which to choose the top 10 men's and women's results that count toward the cup rankings.
The Gators have 21 sports. In the past school year, 14 of them finished in the top 10 in the nation, with the women's swimming and diving team and the men's indoor track team capturing national championships.
Mary Wise, the volleyball coach, and Tim Walton, the softball coach, earn a lot less than Meyer's $4.5 million a year. But with annual salaries and benefits in 2009 of nearly $365,000 and $253,000, they are paid substantially more than their peers in their sports. "They've earned it," said Foley, who pays all of his coaches handsomely.
Wise led the volleyball team to 18 straight SEC titles from 1991 to 2008 and 7 Final Four appearances. Walton has earned two SEC regular-season and tournament softball titles, and has taken his team to the Women's College World Series three years in a row.
Goodbye, Small Time
The university laid off 139 faculty and staff members from 2007 to 2010 in response to the more than $150 million reduction in state funding.
The athletic budget, however, is up 6 percent to $94.6 million from $89 million the previous school year. The University Athletic Association, a nonprofit corporation that reports to Florida's Board of Trustees, finances the athletic department, and Foley is its chief financial officer.
"This would be a different conversation if we were losing money over there," said Machen, whose compensation package will equal Foley's $1.2 million in 2012.
When a program like Florida makes a bold move, others pay attention. In the SEC, Florida has helped ignite a building boom in everything from swimming to golf. At the University of Tennessee, new facilities include an aquatics center, a softball stadium and a $16 million makeover of the baseball stadium. Plans are under way for a clubhouse and driving range for the golf teams.
The projects at Tennessee show how the big-time sports mentality has bled into smaller sports, said Todd Diacon, who served until recently as the faculty athletics representative at Tennessee.
"It strikes me that all the ills that people tend to throw at the revenue sports have now jumped over to the nonrevenue sports," he said. "It doesn't feel like it's sustainable to me."
Mike Patrick, the women's tennis coach at Tennessee, said when he started coaching at the college level in the 1980s, he drove the van, strung the rackets and served as the strength coach, massage therapist and trainer.
"We didn't have much, and I don't think that much was expected of us," he said.
Now, Patrick has money and a mandate, elevating expectations: "They fund us and give us the means necessary to be competitive, in the top 25 national teams. Is that pressure? Not any more than I put on myself to be as good as we can be."
Becky Burleigh, the only women's soccer coach Florida has had, gets butterflies as her team's season approaches. Women's soccer is the first of Florida's sports with a chance to score points in the Directors' Cup. She agrees that success is prized in the culture of Florida athletics.
At last year's Christmas party, "one of the games was a competition where people were paired up and they had to throw and catch small marshmallows with their mouths," she said. "You had to back up a little farther each time. It didn't take long before women with dresses and guys in good clothes were diving on the floor. This is a place where people are built to win."

Full text: TOKYO -- Japan promised a host of measures on Monday in a bid to ignite its faltering economy and temper a punishingly strong yen.
Prime Minister Naoto Kan proposed new stimulus steps, while the Bank of Japan, under pressure from the government, further eased its already easy monetary policy.
But analysts called the measures too timid in the face of the problems plaguing Japan's export-oriented economy. A yen that has paradoxically surged to 15-year highs despite weaknesses in the country's economy, coupled with the damaging phenomenon of falling prices known as deflation, continues to hinder hopes of a strong recovery, analysts said.
The proposals, however, had little effect on the currency markets, where the yen strengthened again Monday. The yen rose to 84.67 against the dollar.
"There seems to be a sense of fatalism. The B.O.J. continues to play the same old game of making incremental, but ultimately meaningless, policy changes in response to political pressure," said Richard Jerram, economist for Japan at the global investment bank, Macquarie.
"The government talks of the need for fiscal reconstruction, but then tries to construct an economic stimulus package with tiny fiscal measures and minor, uncoordinated structural reforms," Mr. Jerram said. Intervention in the currency markets "looks necessary, but is absent," he said. Japan has not intervened in currency markets since 2003-4, when the finance ministry sold 35 trillion yen for dollars.
Some analysts said that the latest government moves appeared symbolic, a stand by Prime Minister Kan to show that he was addressing the strengthening yen when his leadership was in question.
At party elections next month, Mr. Kan will face a challenge from one of his lieutenants, the longtime lawmaker Ichiro Ozawa.
Though Mr. Ozawa appears to be unpopular with the public -- he faces a criminal investigation into a political financing scandal -- he is credited within the ruling Democratic Party with engineering its victory in elections last year, and still commands a large following.
Mr. Ozawa's reputation as a proponent of more government spending -- something Mr. Kan, a relative fiscal hawk, has been averse to -- could be spurring the prime minister to instead lean on the Bank of Japan to do more to prop up the economy. Mr. Ozawa has been critical of Mr. Kan for his handling of the economy.
The infighting brings another layer of uncertainty to Japan's economic outlook, analysts said.
"Given the very fluid political situation at present, including the possibility of political realignment, it is hard to forecast just what impact the outcome of the leadership election will have on the direction of longer-term economic policy," Takahide Kiuchi, an economist at the Financial and Economic Research Center at Nomura Securities, said in a report late Monday.
A global economic crisis led Japan to its worst recession in decades, and the country's recovery has looked increasingly shaky. Figures released in August showed that Japan's economy grew 0.1 percent in the April-June quarter.
A jump in the value of the yen to 15-year highs has hampered exports, which are responsible for much of Japan's growth, by making them more expensive.
Disappointing Japan's exporters, Mr. Kan was silent on whether Japan would intervene directly in international currency markets to help weaken the yen.
Though such a move could cap the yen's rise in the short term, intervention by Japan alone is not expected to do much to weaken the currency in the longer term -- especially because Tokyo is unlikely to find much support from other big currency players like the United States or the European Union, both of which are quite happy for Japanese exports to stay uncompetitive.
Still, Mr. Kan said at a meeting with lawmakers Monday that the government and central bank working in tandem was a step forward toward recovery.
"The two pillars of economic policy and the Bank of Japan's new monetary measures will enable us to respond speedily," Mr. Kan said.
The Bank of Japan announced Monday after an emergency meeting that it would expand the volume of money available to banks under a special fixed rate to 30 trillion yen ($351 billion) up from 20 trillion yen. It also introduced a six-month loan facility on top of a three-month program already in place, all steps aimed at raising the supply of loans to banks. The central bank's board voted to leave its main overnight target rate at 0.1 percent.
Apart from easing the yen's rise, the measures are intended to help Japan's economy by increasing the supply of money and encouraging banks to lend more. But years of economic stagnation in Japan have sapped demand for loans from companies and consumers, despite rock-bottom interest rates, which has fueled deflation, a general decline in prices that eats into profit and wages.
The bank also indicated that it had downgraded its assessment of the economy, citing volatile foreign exchange markets and uncertainty over the economic health of major trading partners like the United States -- a move that could pave the way for more steps to ease monetary policy.
But markets were disappointed: anticipation of decisive action had sent Japan's Nikkei index up more than 3 percent early Monday, but stocks surrendered almost half of the gains after the bank's announcement. The Nikkei ended 1.76 percent higher at 9,149.26.
Analysts say that though the bank's options are running out, there are still steps it could take to help the economy. It could cut its main interest rate from 0.1 percent to zero percent, increase its purchase of Japanese government bonds or buy other assets.
Some opposition lawmakers have called for an inflation target to raise expectations among investors that the bank will keep monetary policy easy until Japan sees inflation of 1 to 2 percent. Still, the governor of the Bank of Japan, Masaaki Shirakawa, defended the bank's steps, calling them timely and effective, and warned against too much monetary easing.
"We engaged in further monetary easing to deal with the risks of a downturn, in a pre-emptive, accelerated manner," Mr. Shirakawa said after the announcement. "Currently interest rates are low and near zero. We need to carefully examine the drawbacks when considering cutting interest rates further."
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Kan outlined a stimulus package of 900 billion yen ($10.8 billion), about 0.2 percent of Japan's gross domestic product, aimed at beating deflation, protecting jobs and bolstering domestic investment and consumer spending. Because the amount had already been incorporated into the government's 2010 budget as emergency funds, economists did not expect much of an impact.
"This is indeed a small stimulus. But it is even smaller than it appears, since it is being cobbled together out of unspent money from the current budget," William Grimes, a professor in Japanese political economy at Boston University, wrote in an e-mail. "In other words, there is literally no new money."
The government plan extends a subsidy program that has spurred sales of eco-friendly electrical appliances, as well as low-interest housing loans for energy-efficient homes. To help young people find jobs, the plan calls for more career counselors at colleges and internship opportunities at corporations. To discourage companies from moving overseas, the plan offers technological and financial support for small and medium-size businesses. The government also calls for deregulation in sectors like energy, health care and tourism.
Analysts said the stimulus plan did not address fundamental weaknesses in Japan's economy.
In a note to clients, Masaaki Kanno, economist at JPMorgan Securities Japan, said the country still struggled to break free of a vicious cycle in which a strong yen hurts corporate profit, worsens deflationary expectations, raises real interest rates and in turn further strengthens the yen.
"Japan's economy is in a trap," Mr. Kanno said.

Full text: The U.S. venture into Iraq was a war, but it was also a nation-building exercise. America has spent $53 billion trying to reconstruct Iraq, the largest development effort since the Marshall Plan.
So how's it working out?
On the economic front, there are signs of progress. It's hard to know what role the scattershot American development projects have played, but this year Iraq will have the 12th-fastest-growing economy in the world, and it is expected to grow at a 7 percent annual clip for the next several years.
"Iraq has made substantial progress since 2003," the International Monetary Fund reports. Inflation is reasonably stable. A budget surplus is expected by 2012. Unemployment, though still 15 percent, is down from stratospheric levels.
Oil production is back around prewar levels, and there are some who say Iraq may be able to rival Saudi production. That's probably unrealistic, but Iraq will have a healthy oil economy, for better and for worse.
Living standards are also improving. According to the Brookings Institution's Iraq Index, the authoritative compendium of data on this subject, 833,000 Iraqis had phones before the invasion. Now more than 1.3 million have landlines and some 20 million have cellphones. Before the invasion, 4,500 Iraqis had Internet service. Now, more than 1.7 million do.
In the most recent Gallup poll, 69 percent of Iraqis rated their personal finances positively, up from 36 percent in March 2007. Baghdad residents say the markets are vibrant again, with new electronics, clothing and even liquor stores.
Basic services are better, but still bad. Electricity production is up by 40 percent over pre-invasion levels, but because there are so many more air-conditioners and other appliances, widespread power failures still occur.
In February 2009, 45 percent of Iraqis said they had access to trash removal services, which is woeful, though up from 18 percent the year before. Forty-two percent were served by a fire department, up from 23 percent.
About half the U.S. money has been spent building up Iraqi security forces, and here, too, the trends are positive. Violence is down 90 percent from pre-surge days. There are now more than 400,000 Iraqi police officers and 200,000 Iraqi soldiers, with operational performance improving gradually. According to an ABC News/BBC poll last year, nearly three-quarters of Iraqis had a positive view of the army and the police, including, for the first time, a majority of Sunnis.
Politically, the basic structure is sound, and a series of impressive laws have been passed. But these gains are imperiled by the current stalemate at the top.
Iraq ranks fourth in the Middle East on the Index of Political Freedom from The Economist's Intelligence Unit -- behind Israel, Lebanon and Morocco, but ahead of Jordan, Egypt, Qatar and Tunisia. Nearly two-thirds of Iraqis say they want a democracy, while only 19 percent want an Islamic state.
In short, there has been substantial progress on the things development efforts can touch most directly: economic growth, basic security, and political and legal institutions. After the disaster of the first few years, nation building, much derided, has been a success. When President Obama speaks to the country on Iraq, he'll be able to point to a large national project that has contributed to measurable, positive results.
Of course, to be honest, he'll also have to say how fragile and incomplete this success is. Iraqi material conditions are better, but the Iraqi mind has not caught up with the Iraqi opportunity.
There is still very little social trust. Iraq is the fourth-most-corrupt nation on earth, according to Transparency International's rating system. The role of women remains surprisingly circumscribed. Iraqi politicians clearly find it very hard to compromise (though they may be no worse than American politicians in this regard).
Human capital is lagging. Most doctors left Iraq after the invasion, and it is hard to staff health clinics. The engineers left too, so American-built plants lie dormant because there is no one with the skills to run them. Schools are suffering because of a lack of teachers.
Ryan Crocker, the former ambassador, recently wrote an article in The National Interest noting that fear still pervades Iraq. Ethnic animosities are in abeyance, but they are not gone. Guns have been put in closets, but not destroyed.
If he is honest, Obama will have to balance pride with caution. He'll have to acknowledge that the gains the U.S. is enabling may vanish if the U.S. military withdraws entirely next year. He'll have to acknowledge that bottom-up social change requires time and patience. He'll have to heed the advice of serious Iraq hands like Crocker, Michael O'Hanlon of Brookings and Stephen Biddle of the Council on Foreign Relations, and shelve plans to withdraw completely.
Such a move may rob him of a campaign talking point. But it will safeguard an American accomplishment that has been too hard won.

Full text: TEHRAN -- Iran has transferred assets out of European banks in its latest effort to defend itself against the effects of sanctions that are part of what Iranian officials have called an "economic war" against the country by the United States and other Western countries.
Iran's "Central Bank had previously specified a list of its banking reserves in Europe and has transferred them," the bank's governor, Mahmoud Bahmani, was quoted as saying by Iran's semiofficial Fars news agency on Saturday.
Mr. Bahmani did not specify the amount or date of the transfers but said the move had been envisioned "six months in advance" of the new round of trade and financial restrictions placed on Iran by Western nations because of their concerns over the nature of Iran's nuclear program.
"We are currently facing an all-out economic war and we have to be completely prepared," Mr. Bahmani told a conference on Islamic banking here on Saturday.
This month, the head of one of Iran's largest banks, Bank Saderat, said in comments on the bank's Web site that European assets worth about $432 million had been frozen by the nations holding them. Bank Saderat is one of several Iranian banks blacklisted by the United States on suspicion of channeling money to Iran's nuclear program.
A fourth round of United Nations Security Council sanctions, reinforced by separate restrictions imposed by the United States and the European Union, have made it increasingly difficult for Iran to conduct its international business. In recent weeks, South Korea and Japan have also expressed willingness to impose sanctions on Iran, with whom they are major trading partners.
Banks dealing with Iran have also been subjected to harsh penalties. This month, the United States Justice Department imposed a $298 million fine on Barclays for trading with countries that are under United States sanctions, including Iran. As traditional sources of trade close their doors to Iran, analysts said, the Islamic Republic will have to seek alternatives in Asia and the Middle East.
"They will probably forward assets to other banks globally," said an analyst based here who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly. "It makes life a lot harder to find new banking routes, but it never makes it impossible."
Assets that Iran transferred from Europe might pass through companies in Dubai, which has tried to maintain a balance between preserving about $12 billion in annual trade with Iran and convincing its Western partners that it is on board with sanctions.
Still, there is no doubt that years of international sanctions have contributed to high unemployment, inflation and stagnation in important sectors of Iran's economy. The last 12 months have brought growing reports of mass layoffs, unpaid wages and factory closings because of outstanding government debts.
The government of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has been reluctant to reveal current economic growth figures, although critics of his administration say the country could grow as little as 0.5 percent this year.
"Generally for the business community, you talk to people and they are suffering," said a consultant who has significant dealings with both Iranian and international businesses.
Official figures value Iran's imports at around $55 billion, but the real figure could be much higher because of smuggling and black market trade. Many economists blame Mr. Ahmadinejad's expansionist policies for a surge in Iranian imports over the last five years. And an influx of cheap imports has depressed domestic production.
Last week, parliamentary leaders announced a "double urgency" bill to cut unnecessary imports and bolster domestic production after a call by Mr. Bahmani to limit imports to "necessary goods."
"Reducing the consumption of imported goods means confronting the sanctions," Mr. Bahmani said this month. "There is no other way."

Abstract: Mr. Bernanke has told Congress that some additional fiscal stimulus could be helpful in supporting the recovery, as long as it was accompanied by a credible plan to gradually bring deficits under control and stabilize the ratio of debt to gross domestic product, the broadest measure of economic output. Mr. Bernanke's reluctance to weigh in on fiscal policy -- a departure from his predecessor, Alan Greenspan, who endorsed the tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 but now supports letting all of them expire -- is partly a reflection of his personality but also stems from the Fed's delicate political position.

Full text: JACKSON HOLE, Wyo. -- Federal Reserve officials and economists appear increasingly united in their view that the partisan gridlock on fiscal policy in Washington has clouded the prospects for a faster and stronger recovery.
The Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, who has assiduously avoided taking sides in fiscal debates, said on Friday that the central bank stood ready to use a variety of tools to forestall deflation, a broad decline in prices. But he made it clear that the Fed could not simply conjure up a recovery by manipulating interest rates and the money supply.
"Central bankers alone cannot solve the world's economic problems," Mr. Bernanke said in what became a theme of the annual Fed policy symposium here, organized by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City.
Mr. Bernanke has told Congress that some additional fiscal stimulus could be helpful in supporting the recovery, as long as it was accompanied by a credible plan to gradually bring deficits under control and stabilize the ratio of debt to gross domestic product, the broadest measure of economic output.
He has not weighed in on specifics -- like the Obama administration's proposal to spur lending to small businesses, or the call by some Republicans to extend all of the Bush-era tax cuts -- but has instead expressed hope that a bipartisan fiscal commission appointed by Mr. Obama will deliver specific and meaningful proposals.
But the commission is not scheduled to deliver its report until December, and the likelihood of additional Congressional action to support the economy before the midterm elections in November seems to be shrinking by the day.
So even as Mr. Bernanke outlined the Fed's options and credited stimulus packages with helping the global recovery, he appeared to be tamping down expectations for a government-led fix. "For a sustained expansion to take hold, growth in private final demand -- notably, consumer spending and business fixed investment -- must ultimately take the lead," he said.
He added, optimistically, "On the whole, in the United States, that critical handoff appears to be under way."
Mr. Bernanke's reluctance to weigh in on fiscal policy -- a departure from his predecessor, Alan Greenspan, who endorsed the tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 but now supports letting all of them expire -- is partly a reflection of his personality but also stems from the Fed's delicate political position.
"The Fed has in many ways been left holding the bag while fiscal policy has fallen short," said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan group that has urged an immediate commitment to reduce the deficit in the medium term. "There is excessive pressure on the Fed, because of the uncertainty about fiscal policy."
Thomas D. Gallagher, a senior managing director at the research firm International Strategy and Investment, said it was wise of Mr. Bernanke to lay out the potential costs of additional actions the Fed could take, like resuming large-scale purchases of government debt.
"None of them is an unambiguously positive, no-brainer option," he said. "The Fed should try to limit expectations about how much monetary policy can accomplish in this post-crisis period."
In one of five research papers delivered at the symposium, which ended Saturday, Eric M. Leeper, an economist at Indiana University, challenged monetary economists to focus more attention on large fiscal deficits. In an analogy that stirred debate, he said that monetary policy had been honed to a science, and he likened fiscal policy to medieval alchemy.
"In normal times, fiscal policy doesn't pose insurmountable problems for monetary policy," said Mr. Leeper, a former Fed researcher. "These normal times may be coming to an end. Demographic shifts in most of the advanced economies are putting ever-increasing demands on government spending. We're heading toward an era of fiscal stress."
Public confidence in the Fed's ability to maintain price stability relies in part on expectations that government debts will not rise to unsustainable levels, Mr. Leeper said, suggesting that such expectations were eroding.
Douglas W. Elmendorf, director of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and a former Fed researcher, said Mr. Leeper's paper "greatly overstates the potential for fiscal policy to be made in a scientific way."
"Fiscal policy is intrinsically about distributional choices," he said, adding, "There is no scientific basis for saying how large the government deficit should be -- any more than what my level of savings should be."
Robert B. Zoellick, president of the World Bank, said that while the scientific precision of monetary policy had perhaps been overstated, he wished that Mr. Bernanke had mentioned the role fiscal policy could play in spurring the recovery. "The fiscal policy challenges that I see are at a different order of magnitude than anything I have either observed or dealt with over the last 25 years," he said.
Not all countries leave every debt and deficit question to politicians: Sweden and Hungary use fiscal policy councils, while Israel and Chile use fiscal rules that cap growth in government spending. "Things like the White House budget commission are just alchemy as usual," Mr. Leeper said.
Another paper that drew considerable discussion here, presented by Charles R. Bean, deputy governor of the Bank of England, suggested that asset purchases to lower long-term interest rates -- like the Fed's purchase of $1.25 trillion in mortgage-backed securities in 2009-10 -- have been successful in responding to the recession but "are probably best kept in the locker marked 'For emergency use only.' "
Mr. Bean, like Mr. Bernanke, argued forcefully against the idea of raising medium-term inflation targets in response to recession.
"The thing I'm most worried about with some of the current discussion is that monetary policy is going to be asked to do more than it's capable of," he said. "It's useful for stabilizing prices, but if we expect it do multiple things simultaneously, I think we are going to be stirring up trouble for ourselves in the future."
Or as Jacob A. Frenkel, chairman of JPMorgan Chase International and a former governor of the Bank of Israel, put it: "We all know that the main gorilla in the room is fiscal policy."

Full text: JACKSON HOLE, Wyo. -- The American economy could experience painfully slow growth and stubbornly high unemployment for a decade or longer as a result of the 2007 collapse of the housing market and the economic turmoil that followed, according to an authority on the history of financial crises.
That finding, contained in a new paper by Carmen M. Reinhart, an economist at the University of Maryland, generated considerable debate during an annual policy symposium here, organized by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, which concluded on Saturday.
The gathering, at a historic lodge in Grand Teton National Park, brought together about 110 central bankers and economists, including most of the Federal Reserve's top officials. In 2008, the symposium occurred weeks before the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy nearly shut down the financial markets. At the symposium last year, officials congratulated themselves on weathering the worst of the crisis.
But the recent slowing of the recovery cast a pall on this year's gathering. As economists (some wearing jeans and cowboy boots) conferred on a terrace with a sweeping view of the 13,770-foot peak of Mount Teton, or watched a horse trainer tame an unruly colt at a nearby ranch, they anxiously discussed research like Ms. Reinhart's. (Participants pay to attend the event, which is not financed by taxpayers, a Kansas City Fed spokeswoman emphasized.)
"I'm more worried than I have ever been about the future of the U.S. economy," said Allen Sinai, co-founder of the consulting firm Decision Economics and a longtime participant in the symposium. "The challenge is unique: poor and diminishing growth, a sticky unemployment rate, sky-high deficits and a sovereign debt that makes us one of the most fiscally irresponsible countries in the world."
Ms. Reinhart's paper drew upon research she conducted with the Harvard economist Kenneth S. Rogoff for their book "This Time Is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly," published last year by Princeton University Press. Her husband, Vincent R. Reinhart, a former director of monetary affairs at the Fed, was the co-author of the paper.
The Reinharts examined 15 severe financial crises since World War II as well as the worldwide economic contractions that followed the 1929 stock market crash, the 1973 oil shock and the 2007 implosion of the subprime mortgage market.
In the decade following the crises, growth rates were significantly lower and unemployment rates were significantly higher. Housing prices took years to recover, and it took about seven years on average for households and companies to reduce their debts and restore their balance sheets. In general, the crises were preceded by decade-long expansions of credit and borrowing, and were followed by lengthy periods of retrenchment that lasted nearly as long.
"Large destabilizing events, such as those analyzed here, evidently produce changes in the performance of key macroeconomic indicators over the longer term, well after the upheaval of the crisis is over," Ms. Reinhart wrote.
Ms. Reinhart added that officials may err in failing to recognize changed economic circumstances. "Misperceptions can be costly when made by fiscal authorities who overestimate revenue prospects and central bankers who attempt to restore employment to an unattainably high level," she warned.
Several scholars here cautioned that it was premature to infer long-term economic woes for the United States from the aftermath of past crises.
The Reinharts' research "has not yet tried to assess the extent to which different policy stances mitigated the length of the outcome," said Susan M. Collins, an economist and the dean of the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy at the University of Michigan. "But the reality is that we need to have an understanding that the issues we are dealing with are severe, and that we should not expect them to be unwound in a few months."
Ms. Collins added: "I'm very much a glass-half-full person. What we've seen in the past few years has been a policy success. Things are not where we want them to be, but they could have been a lot worse."
The Reinharts' paper was not the only one to offer somber implications for policy makers.
Two economists, James H. Stock of Harvard and Mark W. Watson of Princeton, presented a paper arguing that inflation, which has already fallen so much that some Fed officials fear the economy is at risk of deflation, a cycle of falling prices and wages, could fall even further by the middle of next year.
Inflation has been running well below the Fed's unofficial target of about 1.5 percent to 2 percent. Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, reiterated on Friday that the central bank would "strongly resist deviations from price stability in the downward directions."
Mr. Stock and Mr. Watson noted that recessions in the United States were associated with declines in inflation, with an exception being an increase in inflation in 2004, which occurred despite a "jobless recovery" from the 2001 recession. The authors said they could not explain the anomaly but also could not "offer a reason why it might happen again."

Full text: CORRECTION APPENDED
Berkeley, Calif.
OUR national debate about fiscal policy has become skewed, with far too much focus on the deficit and far too little on unemployment. There is too much worry about the size of government, and too little appreciation for how stimulus spending has helped stabilize the economy and how more of the right kind of government spending could boost job creation and economic growth. By focusing on the wrong things, we are in serious danger of failing to do the right things to help the economy recover from its worst labor market crisis since the Great Depression.
The primary cause of the labor market crisis is a collapse in private demand -- the same problem that bedeviled the economy in the 1930s. In the wake of the financial shocks at the end of 2008, spending by American households and businesses plummeted, and companies responded by curbing production and shedding workers. By late 2009, in response to unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimulus, household and business spending began to recover. But by the second quarter of this year, economic growth had slowed to 1.6 percent, according to a government estimate issued Friday. Clearly, the pace of recovery is far slower than what is needed to restore the millions of jobs that have been lost.
Households and businesses are on a saving spree to rebuild their balance sheets. Their spending relative to income has fallen more than at any time since the end of World War II. So there is now a substantial gap between the supply of goods and services the economy is capable of producing and the demand for them. This gap is starkly reflected by the 23 million Americans who are looking for full-time jobs and the millions more who have left the labor force because they could not find one.
The situation would be even worse without the $787 billion fiscal stimulus package passed in 2009. The conventional wisdom about the stimulus package is wrong: it has not failed. It is working as intended. Its spending increases and tax cuts have boosted demand and added about three million more jobs than the economy otherwise would have. Without it, the unemployment rate would be about 11.5 percent. Because about 36 percent of the money remains to be spent, more jobs will be created -- about 500,000 by the end of the year.
But by next year, the stimulus will end, and the flip from fiscal support to fiscal contraction could shave one to two percentage points off the growth rate at a time when the unemployment rate is still well above 9 percent. Under these circumstances, the economic case for additional government spending and tax relief is compelling. Sadly, polls indicate that the political case is not.
Two forms of spending with the biggest and quickest bang for the buck are unemployment benefits and aid to state governments. The federal government should pledge generous financing increases for both programs through 2011.
Federal aid to the states is especially important because they finance education. Although the jobs crisis is primarily a crisis of demand, it also reflects a mismatch between the education of the work force and the education required for jobs in today's economy. Consider how the unemployment rate varies by education level: it's more than 14 percent for those without a high school degree, under 10 percent for those with one, only about 5 percent for those with a college degree and even lower for those with advanced degrees. The supply of college graduates is not keeping pace with demand. Therefore, more investment in education could reduce both the cyclical unemployment rate, as more Americans stay in school, and the structural unemployment rate, as they graduate into the job market.
An increase in government investment in roads, airports and other kinds of public infrastructure would be cost-effective, too, as measured by the number of jobs created per dollar of spending. And it would help reduce the road congestion, airport delays and freight bottlenecks that reduce productivity and make the United States a less attractive place to do business. The American Society of Civil Engineers has identified more than $2.2 trillion in public infrastructure needs nationwide, and a 2008 study by the Congressional Budget Office found that, on strict cost-benefit grounds, it would make sense to increase annual spending on transportation projects alone by 74 percent.
Over the next five years, the federal government should work with state and local governments and the private sector to finance $1 trillion worth of additional investment in infrastructure. It should extend the Build America Bonds stimulus program, which in the past year has helped states finance $120 billion in infrastructure improvement.
The federal government should also create and capitalize a National Infrastructure Bank that would provide greater certainty about the level of infrastructure financing over several years, select projects based on rigorous cost-benefit analysis, invest in things like interstate high-speed rail that require coordination among states and attract private co-investors in projects like toll roads and airports that generate dedicated future revenue streams.
But can the government afford this additional spending? The answer is yes. Despite the large federal deficit, global savers, including savings-hungry American households, are snapping up United States government securities at very low interest rates. And they will continue to do so as long as there is ample slack in the economy and inflation remains subdued. Over the next few years, there is little risk that federal deficits will crowd out private investment or precipitate a crisis of confidence in the American government, a spike in American interest rates or a sudden drop in the dollar.
On the other hand, as long as private demand remains weak, the risk is uncomfortably high that trying to reduce the deficit -- by cutting spending or increasing taxes -- will tip the economy back into recession or condemn it to years of faltering growth and debilitating unemployment. In fact, either outcome would depress tax revenue and could mean larger deficits.
Faced with these risks, as long as the economy is operating far below potential, policy makers should do two seemingly contradictory things. First, they should provide additional fiscal support for job creation and growth. And, second, they should enact a credible multiyear plan now to stabilize the ratio of federal debt to gross domestic product gradually as the economy recovers.
By easing capital market concerns about the government's future borrowing needs, such a plan would permit larger deficits and slower debt reduction while unemployment is still high. The long-run debt problem -- the result of imprudent fiscal decisions before the recession, escalating health care costs and an aging population -- must be addressed once the economy has recovered. But for now the priorities of fiscal policy should be jobs and investment.

Full text: THE American economy is once again tilting toward danger. Despite an aggressive regimen of treatments from the conventional to the exotic -- more than $800 billion in federal spending, and trillions of dollars worth of credit from the Federal Reserve -- fears of a second recession are growing, along with worries that the country may face several more years of lean prospects.
On Friday, Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Fed, speaking in the measured tones of a man whose word choices can cause billions of dollars to move, acknowledged that the economy was weaker than hoped, while promising to consider new policies to invigorate it, should conditions worsen.
Yet even as vital signs weaken -- plunging home sales, a bleak job market and, on Friday, confirmation that the quarterly rate of economic growth had slowed, to 1.6 percent -- a sense has taken hold that government policy makers cannot deliver meaningful intervention. That is because nearly any proposed curative could risk adding to the national debt -- a political nonstarter. The situation has left American fortunes pinned to an uncertain remedy: hoping that things somehow get better.
It increasingly seems as if the policy makers attending like physicians to the American economy are peering into their medical kits and coming up empty, their arsenal of pharmaceuticals largely exhausted and the few that remain deemed too experimental or laden with risky side effects. The patient -- who started in critical care -- was showing signs of improvement in the convalescent ward earlier this year, but has since deteriorated. The doctors cannot agree on a diagnosis, let alone administer an antidote with confidence.
This is where the Great Recession has taken the world's largest economy, to a Great Ambiguity over what lies ahead, and what can be done now. Economists debate the benefits of previous policy prescriptions, but in the political realm a rare consensus has emerged: The future is now so colored in red ink that running up the debt seems politically risky in the months before the Congressional elections, even in the name of creating jobs and generating economic growth. The result is that Democrats and Republicans have foresworn virtually any course that involves spending serious money.
The growing impression of a weakening economy combined with a dearth of policy options has reinvigorated concerns that the United States risks sinking into the sort of economic stagnation that captured Japan during its so-called Lost Decade in the 1990s. Then, as now, trouble began when a speculative real estate frenzy ended, leaving banks awash in debts they preferred not to recognize and hoping that bad loans would turn good (or at least be forgotten). The crisis was deepened by indecisive policy, as the ruling party fruitlessly explored ways around a painful reckoning -- boosting exports, tinkering with accounting standards.
"There are many ways in which you can see us almost surely being in a Japan-style malaise," said the Nobel-laureate economist Joseph Stiglitz, who has accused the Obama administration of underestimating the dangers weighing on the economy. "It's just really hard to see what will bring us out."
Japan's years of pain were made worse by deflation -- falling prices -- an affliction that assailed the United States during the Great Depression and may be gathering force again. While falling prices can be good news for people in need of cars, housing and other wares, a sustained, broad drop discourages businesses from investing and hiring. Less work and lower wages translates into less spending power, which reinforces a predilection against hiring and investing -- a downward spiral.
Deflation is both symptom and cause of an economy whose basic functioning has stalled. It reflects too many goods and services in the marketplace with not enough people able to buy them.
For more than a decade, the global economy was fueled by monumental spending power underwritten by a pair of investment booms in America -- the Internet explosion in the 1990s, then the exuberance over real estate. As housing prices soared, homeowners borrowed against rising values, distributing their dollars to furniture dealers in suburban malls, and furniture factories in coastal China.
But the collapse of American housing prices severed that artery of finance. Homeowners could not borrow, and they cut spending, shrinking sales for businesses and prompting layoffs.
Early this year, some economists declared that the cycle was finally righting itself. Businesses were restocking inventories, yielding modest job growth in factories. Hopes flowered that these new wages would be spent in ways that led to the hiring of more workers -- a virtuous cycle.
But the hopes failed to account for how extensively spending power had dropped in the American economy, and how uneasy people were made by every snippet of data showing that houses were not selling, employers were not hiring, and stock prices were foundering.
Now, a new cause for concern is growing: the flat trajectory of prices, which might metastasize into a full-blown case of deflation.
The primary way to attack deflation is to inject credit into the economy, giving reluctant consumers the wherewithal to spend. The chief deflation fighter is the Federal Reserve, which traditionally adjusts a benchmark overnight rate for banks that influences rates on car loans, mortgages and other forms of credit. The Fed pulled this lever long ago, and has kept its target rate near zero since late 2008.
The Fed has also been more creative. During the worst of the financial crisis, the Fed relieved American banks of troubled investments, many linked to mortgages, to give the banks room to make new loans.
This engendered the sort of debate likely to fill doctoral dissertations for generations. Most economists praise the Fed for confronting the possibility of another depression. But the Fed added to the nation's debts, provoking talk that it was testing global faith in the dollar.
The dramatic expansion of the national debt -- which began in the Bush administration, via hefty tax cuts and two wars -- has ratcheted up fears that, one day, creditors like China and Japan might demand sharply higher interest rates to finance American spending. Those rates would spread through the economy and inflict the reverse of deflation: inflation, or rising prices, as merchants lose faith in the sanctity of the dollar and demand more dollars in exchange for oil, electronics and other items.
So far, the reverse has happened. As investors lose faith in real estate and stocks, they are flooding into government savings bonds, keeping interest rates exceedingly low. Still, inflation worries occupy the people who control money, not least the governors of the Fed. The Fed has been seeking a graceful exit from its interventions, aiming to unload its cache of mortgage-linked investments and -- likely in the far future -- lift interest rates.
But the recent disturbing economic news has delayed those plans. This month, the Fed said it would take the proceeds from its mortgage-linked investments and buy Treasury bills to keep longer-term interest rates down. The Wall Street Journal reported that this decision came amid substantial disagreement among the Fed's governors, suggesting that future action will be constrained by fears of inflation.
Republicans in Congress have embraced further tax cuts and less spending as the answer to the weak economy, while accusing the administration of squandering stimulus spending on efforts that brought little gain. Some conservative analysts liken the government's reliance on spending and credit to imbibing another cocktail to take the edge off a hangover. In this view, the weak economy should be welcomed for the discipline it imposes, forcing a paring back of unsustainable spending, while building up savings that can finance investment and later feed healthy economic growth.
"The recession is the cure for the disease that affects the economy, but the politicians don't have the stomach for it," says Peter Schiff, president of Euro Pacific Capital, a Connecticut-based brokerage house. "They're going to keep stimulating the economy until they kill it with an overdose. The hyper-inflation that results is going to be far worse than the cure."
Germany, which has long harbored particularly powerful fears of inflation, has done relatively well in the current downturn without large stimulus spending, and that experience is now cited by adherents of austerity. But it can be argued that the Germans had two advantages over Americans: A more extensive social safety net to give consumers more money and the confidence to spend it, and a vibrant manufacturing base to churn out more goods for export.
Most economists who are close to the policy making arena for both parties take the position that austerity is the wrong medicine for what ails the American economy, and they dismiss warnings about inflation as akin to focusing on the side effects of chemotherapy in the face of cancer. First, they argue, take the medicine and stave off the lethal threat; then deal with the collateral problems.
Regardless, inflation fears persist, constraining what limited prescriptions might otherwise be thrown at a weakening economy.
The impending elections in November -- with control of Congress hanging in the balance -- has further narrowed the contours of political possibility
Six months ago, Alan Blinder, a former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, and now an economist at Princeton, dismissed the idea that America's political system would ever allow the country to sink into a Japan-style quagmire. "Now I'm looking at the political system turning itself into a paralyzed beast," he says, adding that a lost decade now looms as "a much bigger risk." Congress and the Obama administration have ruled out further stimulus spending. The Fed appears to be running out of powder. "Its really powerful ammunition has been expended," Mr. Blinder says.
Even after the November election, few expect a different dynamic. "We're already in a gridlock situation, and nothing substantive is going to change," says Bruce Bartlett, who was a Treasury economist in the first Bush administration. "Clearly, a weak economy in 2012 will be very good for whoever the Republican presidential candidate is. It's hard to see how the Republicans lose by blocking stimulus."
On the other hand, if deflation emerges as a verifiable menace, many economists expect Mr. Bernanke -- an expert on the Great Depression -- to again champion aggressive measures, perhaps expanding the Fed's balance sheet to buy pools of auto loans or credit card debt.
"It's very likely the Fed will bend in that direction if the economy stays soft, especially if they are starting to see deflation," says Kenneth S. Rogoff, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, and now a professor at Harvard. "That's really starting to loom."
On Friday, Mr. Bernanke, whose board can operate independent of politics and the government, offered assurance that he still had powerful therapies to use should conditions worsen. Yet he also expressed concern about the potential side effects, underscoring a reluctance for more action.
"The issue at this stage is not whether we have the tools to help support economic activity and guard against disinflation," he said. "We do." Then he added: "The issue is instead whether, at any given juncture, the benefits of each tool, in terms of additional stimulus, outweigh the associated costs or risks of using the tool."
Right now, many homeowners owe the bank more than their homes are worth, prompting some to abandon properties, adding inventory to a market choked with vacant addresses. An Obama administration program aimed at slowing foreclosures has prolonged trouble, say some economists, by failing to relieve borrowers of unsustainable debt burdens or making transparent the extent of losses yet to be confronted by the financial system.
"The big question is, who's going to swallow the losses," says Mr. Stiglitz. "It should be the banks, but they don't want to. We're likely to be in paralysis for years if they prevail."
The Treasury sits in the middle, concerned by the continued weakness of housing, yet unwilling to pressure banks to write down mortgage balances.
Like their Japanese counterparts a decade ago, Treasury officials worry that forcing the banks to take losses could weaken them and risk another crisis.
By default, muddling through has emerged as the prescription of the moment.

Full text: MOSCOW -- Early reports from Russia's harvest indicate that yields of wheat and barley are down sharply, as predicted after a major drought here this summer that has helped send global wheat prices up sharply since June.
Despite the implications for Russian consumers and the global market, the crop failures may translate to a relatively minimal financial effect on the country's agricultural companies, which before the drought were just catching their stride after an overhaul of Soviet-era collective farms. The higher prices, in fact, made one company profitable, according to an earnings report released Friday.
Nationally, the harvest has been diminished by more than 30 percent, according to the ministry of agriculture. Russia will certainly produce less grain than it consumes for the first time since 2004, and may import wheat for the first time in a decade. Last year it was the world's third-largest wheat exporter, behind the United States and Canada.
On Friday, wheat for delivery in December was trading on the Chicago Board of Trade for $6.95 a bushel -- up more than 40 percent from its low in June before the drought but down from its high of $8.68 on Aug. 6 after Russian announced an export ban. On Russia's domestic market it is now selling at about $6.20 a bushel.
Expressing anger over the higher bread prices in Russia that have accompanied the rise in grain, Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin said Friday, "Someone is simply cashing in on the circumstances." Prosecutors have recently raided bakeries in Moscow on accusations of price gouging.
A bad harvest used to mean heads would roll in the Communist Party. But the spread of corporate farming in Russia in recent years now means investment portfolios are on the line, instead.
The drought "has been a watershed event for the industry," Michael Schneyderman, chief financial officer for Black Earth Farming, an operator of fields in central Russia that is listed on the Stockholm stock exchange, said in a telephone interview Friday, after the company released second-quarter earnings showing a profit of $1.4 million.
That profit, coming amid the drought, was in contrast to the company's persistent losses of the last few years. "It's a silver lining," Mr. Schneyderman said.
With the harvest about half over, most investor-financed farming operations that took over from the collective farms over the last decade appear to be poised to lose some money. Mikhail V. Krasnoperov, an analyst at Troika Dialog bank, said Russian farmers would collectively earn about $1 billion less than they expected in the spring, according to a calculation based on the lower harvest forecast and factoring in current wheat prices.
Yet, of perhaps longer-term importance for Russian agriculture, several of the largest private companies, including Black Earth, are saying that rising prices will more than make up for their yield losses from the drought.
Black Earth Farming reported Friday that yields of winter wheat, usually the most bountiful crop, fell to 1.9 metric tons per hectare, compared with 3.5 tons last year. But other crops, including sunflowers and soybeans, fared better.
Over all, Black Earth Farming says wheat prices are up 71 percent since spring, while yields are on average down 30 to 40 percent from forecasts before the drought.
"Whatever we've lost in the yield, we sincerely hope to compensate by way of rising price," Mr. Schneyderman, the chief financial officer, said.
In fact, shares of Razgulay, a grain producer listed on the Micex stock exchange in Moscow, rose by 23 percent in July. Shares in another Russian producer, Pava, rose 28 percent. Shares in Black Earth did not fare as well, rising 1.8 percent over the month ending Aug. 16, the height of the drought, as the company's fields are in the hardest-hit regions.
The stock activity, analysts say, shows that the market mechanisms that lured investors into the sector are for the most part working, despite efforts at price controls that included a ban on wheat exports announced by Mr. Putin in early August. Analysts say the ban, to remain in effect through Dec. 31, has been largely ineffectual in reducing domestic wheat prices -- pleasing farmers but driving angry officials, including Mr. Putin, to pursue other efforts to control potentially destabilizing food inflation.
Bread prices rose 16 percent from the beginning of July through mid-August, according to the Russian business newspaper Vedomosti. For Russians, particularly the poor or the elderly who recall the privations of the Soviet era, the price of bread is a deeply emotional issue. But analysts say the high domestic grain prices -- a root cause of the higher food prices -- will have the virtue of keeping the Russian grain producers afloat, and able to invest in next year's sowing.
Black Earth said in its filing Friday that it expected to fetch prices of $176 to $208 a metric ton from wheat from the 2010 harvest. By comparison, Russian domestic wheat prices had been languishing around $116 a metric ton before the drought.
Policies pursued here ripple far beyond Russia's borders, to countries in the Middle East that rely on wheat imports, now more expensive, as well as to American breadbasket states where rising prices are elevating the incomes of farmers. (In the United States and other developed countries, the price of grain is a relatively small cost component of processed foods.)
Russia is something of a wild card in global agriculture as it possesses the world's largest reserves of fertile but fallow fields, with vast potential to raise production.
After a series of downgrades this year, the Russian harvest is now forecast at 60 million to 63 million tons, compared with 97 million tons in 2009, according to the ministry of agriculture. So, it is already clear the harvest will fall short of internal demand for food and fodder of 73 million to 75 million tons of grain.
What remains uncertain is whether the government will disburse its roughly 9.6 million tons from state grain reserves this year, to largely cover the shortfall and dampen domestic prices, or hold onto some in the event of another bad harvest next year. If state reserves are withheld, Russian millers and livestock farmers would be compelled to import large quantities of grain for the first time since the late 1990s.
If the country becomes an importer, domestic grain prices will certainly remain roughly in the range of global prices, despite Mr. Putin's ban on exports, according to Ulyana O. Lenvalskaya, a consumer sector analyst at Renaissance Capital bank. Domestic producers like Black Earth will be able to match the prices charged by international grain traders.
The decision on the reserves, like so much else, is expected to rest on whether enough rain falls in the next few weeks to moisten the soil for winter-wheat sowing in central Russia. Rain would improve chances of a better harvest next year, and allow the government to release reserves over the winter.

Full text: JACKSON HOLE, Wyo. The diverging paths of the American and European economies could be discerned Friday in the speeches of Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, and Jean-Claude Trichet, the president of the European Central Bank.
While Mr. Bernanke tried to reassure Americans that the Fed was not impotent to prevent economic recovery from grinding to a halt, Mr. Trichet gave a stern lecture to European governments about the need to change their spendthrift habits of the last few decades.
And while Mr. Bernanke has retreated for the moment from any talk of returning to normal monetary policy, Mr. Trichet is moving out of crisis mode and talking openly of "reabsorbing excessive liquidity."
High debt -- across households, companies and countries -- poses the greatest threat to economic recovery, Mr. Trichet said at an annual Fed policy symposium here, before a gathering of about 100 economists and government officials, including Mr. Bernanke, who had addressed the gathering a few hours earlier.
Buoyed by unexpectedly strong growth in Germany and a calming of the sovereign-debt crisis that roiled the continent in the spring, European leaders have turned their attention to what economists call fiscal consolidation paring spending and reducing government deficits.
"The primary macroeconomic challenge for the next 10 years is to ensure that they do not turn into another 'lost decade'," Mr. Trichet said.
Permanent reductions in public debts are needed to reduce borrowing costs and stimulate private demand, Mr. Trichet said. He said he was "skeptical" about the view that the economy "is at present too fragile and thus consolidation efforts should be postponed or even new fiscal stimulus measures added."
Mr. Trichet said the financial crisis of 2008 was merely a symptom of "the excesses and imbalances accumulated over the previous decades" namely, "the expansion of debt, the build-up of risk and the increase in leverage."
At their June summit meeting in Toronto, leaders of the Group of 20 economies agreed to cut their public deficits in half by 2013 and to stabilize the growth of their public indebtedness, as a proportion of economic output, by 2016.
Mr. Trichet broadly endorsed those targets. "Just as we showed courage in facing the pressing demands of the crisis itself, now policy-makers must be equally courageous in dealing with these longer-term threats to stability and growth," he said.
In some respects, Mr. Trichet's arguments resembled those of conservative Republicans in the United States, who have argued against additional fiscal measures even in the face of high unemployment.
"Firms and households know that ultimately they will have to bear the consequences of the painful measures needed to reduce debt," Mr. Trichet said. "As long as it is unclear when the adjustment will occur and who will bear what fraction of the costs of adjustment, firms and households may delay their investment and consumption decision, slowing down the economic recovery."
Aides to Mr. Trichet said his remarks were in no way intended to apply to the American economy, which faces different challenges than Europe does. Even so, the distinction between Mr. Trichet's tone and that of Mr. Bernanke who scarcely mentioned fiscal policy in a half-hour speech that focused on additional steps the Fed could take to bolster the lagging recovery was noted by several economists here.
"The Europeans are feeling more upbeat, given Germany's growth and export performance, and the seeming though perhaps temporary -- calm in the sovereign debt markets," said Maurice Obstfeld, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, and an authority on international finance.
But Mr. Obstfeld noted that Axel Weber, president of the German Bundesbank and a member of the European Central Bank's governing council, has been pushing that central bank to maintain accommodative monetary policies like low interest rates and bond purchases.
"It's interesting that Bernanke didn't mention fiscal policy much," said Professor Obstfeld, a friend of Mr. Bernanke since they were fellow graduate students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the 1970s. "The European Central Bank has always felt more confident commenting on fiscal issues and lecturing the national treasuries on the need for more restraint."
He added: "Of course, Europe has more of a history of fiscal excess leading to high inflation. And with elections in the United States coming up, for the Fed to mention fiscal matters would only serve to politicize it."

Abstract: The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, signaled once again on Friday that the central bank was prepared to act if the economy continued to weaken, as yet another economic report confirmed that the recovery had slowed to a crawl. Mr. Bernanke avoided wading into the rancorous political debates over fiscal policy, instead focusing on the two objectives that form the Fed's legal mandate: price stability and maximum employment.

Full text: JACKSON HOLE, Wyo. -- The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, signaled once again on Friday that the central bank was prepared to act if the economy continued to weaken, as yet another economic report confirmed that the recovery had slowed to a crawl.
Mr. Bernanke made clear that while the Fed could take various steps, including large purchases of government debt, "central bankers alone cannot solve the world's economic problems." Speaking at the Fed's annual symposium here, he hinted broadly that political leaders had to take steps to tackle the deficit and the trade imbalance.
Hours before Mr. Bernanke spoke, the Commerce Department lowered its estimate of economic growth in the second quarter to an annual rate of 1.6 percent, after originally reporting last month that growth from April through June was 2.4 percent. Economists had been predicting a steeper decline, and stock prices rose after the markets opened.
While Mr. Bernanke announced no new steps that the Fed would take immediately, he said the central bank was determined to prevent the economy from slipping into a cycle of falling wages and prices, a situation he said he did not think was likely. Instead he predicted that growth would continue modestly in the second half of the year and pick up in 2011.
Mr. Bernanke said the Fed, having kept short-term interest rates at nearly zero since 2008, had essentially four options:
It can purchase more government debt and long-term securities. It can try to coax down long-term interest rates by announcing its intention to keep short-term rates extremely low for even longer than the markets currently expect. It can lower the interest rate it pays on the funds banks hold at the Fed. And it can raise its medium-term target for inflation, which would discourage banks from sitting on their cash.
Mr. Bernanke suggested that the first of those options was the most likely, and all but ruled out the last two.
While the Fed committee that sets monetary policy was prepared to take new steps "if the outlook were to deteriorate significantly," he said, it "has not agreed on specific criteria or triggers for further action."
As Mr. Bernanke's remarks were released publicly, stock prices immediately fell, a sign that investors were hoping for some concrete signs that the Fed would step in to try to bolster the economy. But as the market digested the chairman's full remarks, prices rebounded and the Dow Jones industrial average rose 164.84 points, or 1.65 percent, to 10,150.65. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.64 percent, from 2.48 percent. The revised second-quarter growth data came after a week that showed that the economic retrenchment that began in the second quarter had spilled into the summer, with a sharp slowdown in new-home sales and a drop in sales of factory goods.
Consumer spending rose 2 percent in the second quarter -- slightly better than the Commerce Department had initially projected. And a closely watched survey by the University of Michigan and Thomson Reuters showed that consumer sentiment ticked up marginally in August, while remaining well below levels seen during the previous six months.
In his first public remarks since the Fed took a modest step on Aug. 10 to lift the economy -- a decision to invest proceeds from its huge mortgage-bond portfolio in long-term Treasury securities -- Mr. Bernanke tried in some respects to dampen expectations that the Fed could make significant headway against the economic sluggishness.
Alan S. Blinder, a former Fed vice chairman and a Princeton professor, noted that Mr. Bernanke focused his remarks on the costs as well as the benefits of additional action to help the economy.
"The Fed has run out of the strong tools, and is turning to the weak ones," Mr. Blinder said in an interview here. "When you're fighting in a foxhole and you've used up the machine guns and hand grenades, then you pull out the swords and start throwing rocks."
Mr. Blinder said that the economy seemed "substantially worse" than it did three months ago -- and that Mr. Bernanke had acknowledged the deterioration, cautiously.
The Obama administration is looking to the Fed to do more to spur the recovery, since its own options are few, given the political paralysis in Congress as midterm elections approach. President Obama, vacationing on Martha's Vineyard, discussed the economy for about 15 minutes with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York before the two men played golf.
Mr. Bernanke avoided wading into the rancorous political debates over fiscal policy, instead focusing on the two objectives that form the Fed's legal mandate: price stability and maximum employment.
Inflation has been running well below the Fed's unofficial target rate of 1.5 to 2 percent. While conceding that inflation had fallen "slightly below" the desirable level, Mr. Bernanke said deflation was "not a significant risk" right now. He said the Fed would "strongly resist deviations from price stability in the downward direction."
Mr. Bernanke predicted the economy would continue to grow the rest of this year, "albeit at a relatively modest pace." He said the "preconditions for a pickup of growth in 2011 appear to remain in place," as banks increase lending, worries over the European sovereign debt crisis abate and consumers save more.
Strikingly, Mr. Bernanke acknowledged that the traditional tradeoff between inflation and employment had become all but obsolete, at least for now. "There is little or no potential conflict between the goals of supporting growth and employment and of maintaining price stability," he said.
Mr. Bernanke explained in detail the Fed's decision to use money from its mortgage bonds to buy government debt. The Fed has gobbled up $1.25 trillion in mortgage-backed securities and $175 billion in debts owed by Fannie Mae and other government entities -- a major reason mortgage rates are at historic lows.
So far, the Fed has received about $140 billion through repayments of the principal on its holdings of those debts. An additional $400 billion or so could be repaid by the end of 2011. If the Fed had not taken the step it did, the central bank's balance sheet would have gradually shrunk, which would amount to a passive tightening of monetary policy -- what Mr. Bernanke called "a perverse outcome."
He said the Fed's purchases of longer-term securities had helped bring down long-term interest rates and lower the cost of borrowing, contributing to the modest recovery that began in the spring of 2009.
However, such purchases seemed to be most effective in times of financial stress, and additional purchases would further complicate the Fed's future "exit strategy" when the time came to return to normal monetary policy, he said.
The Fed has said since March 2009 that "exceptionally low" levels of the fed funds rate, the benchmark short-term interest rate, would be warranted for "an extended period." The Fed could try to lengthen those expectations, as central banks in Canada and Japan have tried. But Mr. Bernanke cautioned that the Fed might find it "difficult to convey the committee's policy intentions with sufficient precision and conditionality."
The Fed currently pays 0.25 percent interest on excess reserves that banks keep at the Fed. But Mr. Bernanke said that slashing that rate even to zero might do no more than lower the fed funds rate by another 0.10 to 0.15 percentage points. He said doing so would harm the liquidity of short-term money markets.
Mr. Bernanke said he saw "no support" on the committee for setting a higher inflation target, as some economists have suggested. He called the strategy "inappropriate for the United States in current circumstances."

Full text:   What will Ben Bernanke, the Fed chairman, say in his big speech Friday in Jackson Hole, Wyo.? Will he hint at new steps to boost the economy? Stay tuned.
But we can safely predict what he and other officials will say about where we are right now: that the economy is continuing to recover, albeit more slowly than they would like. Unfortunately, that's not true: this isn't a recovery, in any sense that matters. And policy makers should be doing everything they can to change that fact.
The small sliver of truth in claims of continuing recovery is the fact that G.D.P. is still rising: we're not in a classic recession, in which everything goes down. But so what?
The important question is whether growth is fast enough to bring down sky-high unemployment. We need about 2.5 percent growth just to keep unemployment from rising, and much faster growth to bring it significantly down. Yet growth is currently running somewhere between 1 and 2 percent, with a good chance that it will slow even further in the months ahead. Will the economy actually enter a double dip, with G.D.P. shrinking? Who cares? If unemployment rises for the rest of this year, which seems likely, it won't matter whether the G.D.P. numbers are slightly positive or slightly negative.
All of this is obvious. Yet policy makers are in denial.
After its last monetary policy meeting, the Fed released a statement declaring that it "anticipates a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization" -- Fedspeak for falling unemployment. Nothing in the data supports that kind of optimism. Meanwhile, Tim Geithner, the Treasury secretary, says that "we're on the road to recovery." No, we aren't.
Why are people who know better sugar-coating economic reality? The answer, I'm sorry to say, is that it's all about evading responsibility.
In the case of the Fed, admitting that the economy isn't recovering would put the institution under pressure to do more. And so far, at least, the Fed seems more afraid of the possible loss of face if it tries to help the economy and fails than it is of the costs to the American people if it does nothing, and settles for a recovery that isn't.
In the case of the Obama administration, officials seem loath to admit that the original stimulus was too small. True, it was enough to limit the depth of the slump -- a recent analysis by the Congressional Budget Office says unemployment would probably be well into double digits now without the stimulus -- but it wasn't big enough to bring unemployment down significantly.
Now, it's arguable that even in early 2009, when President Obama was at the peak of his popularity, he couldn't have gotten a bigger plan through the Senate. And he certainly couldn't pass a supplemental stimulus now. So officials could, with considerable justification, place the onus for the non-recovery on Republican obstructionism. But they've chosen, instead, to draw smiley faces on a grim picture, convincing nobody. And the likely result in November -- big gains for the obstructionists -- will paralyze policy for years to come.
So what should officials be doing, aside from telling the truth about the economy?
The Fed has a number of options. It can buy more long-term and private debt; it can push down long-term interest rates by announcing its intention to keep short-term rates low; it can raise its medium-term target for inflation, making it less attractive for businesses to simply sit on their cash. Nobody can be sure how well these measures would work, but it's better to try something that might not work than to make excuses while workers suffer.
The administration has less freedom of action, since it can't get legislation past the Republican blockade. But it still has options. It can revamp its deeply unsuccessful attempt to aid troubled homeowners. It can use Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored lenders, to engineer mortgage refinancing that puts money in the hands of American families -- yes, Republicans will howl, but they're doing that anyway. It can finally get serious about confronting China over its currency manipulation: how many times do the Chinese have to promise to change their policies, then renege, before the administration decides that it's time to act?
Which of these options should policy makers pursue? If I had my way, all of them.
I know what some players both at the Fed and in the administration will say: they'll warn about the risks of doing anything unconventional. But we've already seen the consequences of playing it safe, and waiting for recovery to happen all by itself: it's landed us in what looks increasingly like a permanent state of stagnation and high unemployment. It's time to admit that what we have now isn't a recovery, and do whatever we can to change that situation.

Full text: The price of potash is all-important to BHP Billiton, the Australian mining company. BHP's $39 billion hostile bid for the Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan is essentially a bet on demand for the commodity.
According to calculations by Reuters Breakingviews, every $50 increase in the long-term price of a metric ton of potash, currently $350, adds about $20 to the Potash Corporation's share value. BHP's $130-a-share offer roughly reflects the current pricing situation.
To value the Potash Corporation, start with its other businesses. The phosphate and nitrogen units are worth about $11 billion, according to Morgan Stanley estimates. The company's stakes in smaller listed rivals have a current market value of $8 billion.
The potash business is trickier to value. Deutsche Bank estimates that building two million tons of new potash capacity requires a $4 billion investment. On that basis, replacing the Potash Corporation's 11.2 million tons of capacity would cost $22.4 billion.
Knock off next year's estimated net debt of $3.5 billion, and the company's standalone value is around $38 billion, or just about what BHP is offering.
Yet that valuation doesn't capture the company's plans to increase potash capacity to more than 17 million tons by 2015 -- or BHP's intention to produce almost as much potash as possible.
Assuming long-term potash prices remain at their current level, and that BHP runs the operations at 90 percent of future capacity, the potash business could generate earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of around $3.2 billion after deducting local taxes. Apply a peer group multiple of nine times, and the Potash Corporation is worth about $148 a share, or right around where the shares are trading.
If potash prices dip to $300 a ton, the bid already looks full. But what if long-term prices rise? Only two years ago, potash peaked at $600 a ton. At $500, Potash shares could be worth $207 each, close to their highs during the commodity boom.
In the Year 2110
If the railroad operator Norfolk Southern can issue 100-year bonds, why can't the United States Treasury? Maturities longer than the current 30-year maximum would reduce refinancing needs and appeal to institutions. But investors might demand more return for the risks than Treasury would be willing to pay.
Norfolk Southern's new bonds yield just under 6 percent, about 0.9 percentage points more than the company's 30-year debt. There's a similar spread between yields on Britain's perpetual War Loan paper and 30-year gilts. Based on the current 30-year Treasury yield of around 3.6 percent, the government would probably expect to sell 100-year bonds at a yield of no more than about 4.5 percent.
Investors, however, could look at the 1960-2010 average inflation rate of about 4.1 percent and demand a real return of 1.7 percent, in line with today's yield on 30-year Treasury inflation-protected securities. So they might expect a yield nearer 5.8 percent. That gap could be tough to close.
Aside from pricing, there's the credit problem. Though lithium-powered skateboards may serve for transportation next century, Norfolk Southern still has 37,000 miles of track and associated land holdings, which will retain real value.
Uncle Sam, however, has a $15 trillion actuarial deficit on Social Security over 75 years and an $88 trillion gap on Medicare. In 100 years, those shortfalls will be current. If the federal government is tempted to print money to excess, the real value of 100-year bonds could erode rapidly.
Finally, there's liquidity. Ultra-long maturity bonds are not traded much because institutions buy and hold them. Norfolk Southern reduced this problem by reopening an old issue that matures in 2105. But if the Treasury started annual sales of century bonds, it would create 70 new maturities before new 30-year issues started coinciding with the remaining repayment time on the 100-year bonds.
Perpetual paper, oddly enough, is potentially more liquid, because new issues are identical to those outstanding. For example, Consols, sold repeatedly since starting in 1751, formed the bulk of the British government's financing in the 19th century and are still outstanding.
If Treasury has the ultra-long term in mind, perpetuals could be a better answer than 100-year bonds. The pricing gap might still be there. But they would be more liquid and avoid focusing investor attention on America's potential solvency in 2110.

Full text: A new report on retail prices of brand-name drugs shows the 217 products most used by older Americans increased by an average of 8.3 percent during 2009, the largest increase in years, even as inflation was negative.
Over the last five years, according to the report to be released on Wednesday by the senior lobby AARP, the retail prices for the most popular brand-name drugs increased 41.5 percent, while the consumer price index rose 13.3 percent. An AARP official called for measures to hold down drug prices.
Drug industry officials challenged the finding, however, saying select brand-name prices did not reflect the reality of more people using low-price generic drugs. Generics now account for about 75 percent of all dispensed prescriptions in the United States, according to IMS Health, a research firm.
The industry pointed to a broader survey of drug prices showing they rose by 3.4 percent during 2009. The survey, conducted by the government for its official Consumer Price Index, includes generic as well as brand-name drug prices, Jonathan Church, an economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, said on Tuesday.
John A. Vernon, an assistant professor of health policy at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, praised the AARP for changing its methods to count retail prices instead of wholesale prices. But Professor Vernon, who had consulted for drug companies and challenged the AARP wholesale price report at a Congressional hearing last year, said its new report was still flawed.
"It can easily be shown that branded prices are higher here than they are in other countries, but we have the lowest and the most competitively priced generic drugs in the world, and the generic share is going up rapidly," he said. "Just focusing on brands I think is unfair."
John C. Rother, executive vice president for policy and strategy for the AARP, agreed that generic drug prices had held stable or declined. But he said the group's new retail price analysis showed why many older Americans were struggling to pay the cost of brand-name drugs they needed for chronic medical conditions.
AARP has changed the method of its annual drug report to look at retail prices, responding to industry complaints last year that measures of wholesale prices, showing brand-name increases far in excess of inflation, were misleading because they did not consider manufacturer discounts. The new report, however, finds the same result on price.
"Brand-name retail prices have been accelerating year-to-year even when inflation has been nonexistent in the rest of the economy," Mr. Rother said in an interview by phone Tuesday.
The incontinence drug Flomax led the way with a 24.8 percent rise in retail price last year, to $4.09 a pill. Flomax sells for $4.42 a pill on drugstore.com, while its generic equivalent, tamsulosin, sells for $3.63 a pill.
Ann Wainwright, a spokeswoman for Boehringer Ingelheim, did not answer questions about Flomax prices in an e-mail, but said the company was committed to access to medicines, including free medication for eligible low-income patients.
The Flomax patent expired this year, opening the gates for generic competition.
During 2009, among the most popular brand-name drugs, retail prices rose 6 percent, to $5.40 a day, on Nexium from AstraZeneca; 8.8 percent, to $5.06 a day, on Plavix from Bristol-Myers Squibb; 7 percent, to $5.50 a day, on Prevacid from Takeda; 6.8 percent, to $4.21 a day, on Protonix from Wyeth; and 4.1 percent, to $4.03, on Lipitor 20-milligram tablets from Pfizer, the report says.
The AARP reported overall increases of 8.3 percent in 2009, 7.9 percent in 2008, 7 percent in 2007, 6.1 percent in 2006, when Medicare drug benefits started, and 6 percent in 2005. The Bureau of Labor Statistics, including generic prices, reported drug price increases for the same years of 3.4, 2.5, 1.4, 4.3 and 3.5 percent. Both used weighted averages to account for product usage.
The AARP report says many older Americans rely on brand-name drugs for chronic illnesses. It says higher prices push them more quickly into a coverage gap known as the "doughnut hole," where they have to pay the full cost of drugs.
That gap is being phased out over the next 10 years under the new health care law, including drug industry discounts on brand-name drug prices in the coverage gap.
The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the industry trade group in Washington, released a statement on Tuesday saying "prescription medicines represent a small and decreasing share of growth in overall health care costs in the United States."
"Not only is the recent rate of growth for prescription medicines historically low, but the recent decline in drug spending growth has contributed to one of the lowest rates of total health care growth in the past 50 years," the group said.
The statement cited reports that Medicare drug spending had been far less than initially projected, partly due to generics.

Full text: Housing will eventually recover from its great swoon. But many real estate experts now believe that home ownership will never again yield rewards like those enjoyed in the second half of the 20th century, when houses not only provided shelter but also a plump nest egg.
The wealth generated by housing in those decades, particularly on the coasts, did more than assure the owners a comfortable retirement. It powered the economy, paying for the education of children and grandchildren, keeping the cruise ships and golf courses full and the restaurants humming.
More than likely, that era is gone for good.
"There is no iron law that real estate must appreciate," said Stan Humphries, chief economist for the real estate site Zillow. "All those theories advanced during the boom about why housing is special -- that more people are choosing to spend more on housing, that more people are moving to the coasts, that we were running out of usable land -- didn't hold up."
Instead, Mr. Humphries and other economists say, housing values will only keep up with inflation. A home will return the money an owner puts in each month, but will not multiply the investment.
Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, estimates that it will take 20 years to recoup the $6 trillion of housing wealth that has been lost since 2005. After adjusting for inflation, values will never catch up.
"People shouldn't look at a home as a way to make money because it won't," Mr. Baker said.
If the long term is grim, the short term is grimmer. Housing experts are bracing themselves for Tuesday, when the sales figures for July will be released. The data is expected to show a drop of as much as 20 percent from last year.
The supply of homes sitting on the market might rise to as much as 12 months, about twice the level of a healthy market. That would push down prices as all those sellers compete to secure a buyer, adding to a slide that has already chopped off as much as 30 percent in home values.
Set against this dismal present and a bleak future, buying a home is a willful act of optimism. That explains why Adam and Allison Lyons are waiting to close on a $417,500 house in Deerfield, Ill.
"We're trying not to think too far ahead," said Ms. Lyons, 35, an information technology manager.
The couple's first venture into real estate came in 2003 when they bought a condo in a 17-unit building under construction in Chicago. By the time they moved in two years later, it was already worth $50,000 more than they had paid. "We were thinking, great!" said Mr. Lyons, 34.
That quick appreciation started them on the same track as their parents, who watched the value of their houses ascend for decades. The real estate crash interrupted that pleasant dream. The couple cannot sell their condo. Unwillingly, they are becoming landlords.
"I don't think we're ever going to see the prosperity our parents did, but I don't think it's all doom and gloom either," said Mr. Lyons, a manager at I.B.M. "At some point, you just have to say what the heck and go for it."
Other buyers have grand and even grander expectations.
In an annual survey conducted by the economists Robert J. Shiller and Karl E. Case, hundreds of new owners in four communities -- Alameda County near San Francisco, Boston, Orange County south of Los Angeles, and Milwaukee -- once again said they believed prices would rise about 10 percent a year for the next decade.
With minor swings in sentiment, the latest results reflect what new buyers always seem to feel. At the boom's peak in 2005, they said prices would go up. When the market was sliding in 2008, they still said prices would go up.
"People think it's a law of nature," said Mr. Shiller, who teaches at Yale.
For the first half of the 20th century, he said, expectations followed the opposite path. Houses were seen the way cars are now: as a consumer durable that the buyer eventually used up.
The notion of housing as an investment first began to blossom after World War II, when the nesting urges of returning soldiers created a construction boom. Demand was stoked as their bumper crop of children grew up and bought places of their own. The inflation of the 1970s, which increased the value of hard assets, and liberal tax policies both helped make housing a good bet. So did the long decline in mortgage rates from the early 1980s.
Despite all these tailwinds, prices rose modestly for much of the period. Real home prices increased 1.1 percent a year after inflation, according to Mr. Shiller's research.
By the late 1990s, however, the rate was 4 percent a year. Happy homeowners were taking about $100 billion a year out of their houses, which paid for a lot of good times.
"The experience we had from the late 1970s to the late 1990s was an aberration," said Barry Ritholtz of the equity research firm Fusion IQ. "People shouldn't be holding their breath waiting for it to happen again."
Not everyone views the notion of real appreciation in real estate as a lost cause.
Bob Walters, chief economist of the online mortgage firm Quicken, acknowledges that the recent collapse will create a "mind scar" just as the Great Depression did. But he argues that housing remains unique.
"You have to live somewhere," he said. "In three or four years, people will resume a normal course, and home values will continue to increase."
All homes are different, and some neighborhoods and regions will rebound more quickly. On the other hand, areas where there was intense overbuilding, like Arizona, will be extremely slow to show any sign of renewal.
"It's entirely likely that markets like Arizona will not recover even in the 15- to 20-year time frame," said Mr. Humphries of Zillow. "The demand doesn't exist."
Owners in those foreclosure-plagued areas consider themselves lucky if they are still solvent. But that does not prevent the occasional regret that a life-changing sum of money was so briefly within their grasp.
Robert Austin, a Phoenix lawyer, paid $200,000 for his home in 2000. Five years later, his neighbors listed a similar home for $500,000.
Freedom beckoned. "I thought, when my daughter gets out of school, I can sell the house and buy a boat and sail around the world," said Mr. Austin, 56.
His home is now worth about what he paid for it. As for that cruise, "it may be a while," Mr. Austin said. Showing the hopefulness that is apparently innate to homeowners, he added: "But I won't rule it out forever."

Full text: OPERA in translation was once commonplace. In the age of titles, many think the practice is archaic. But not Peter Moores, a 78-year-old Englishman knighted in 2003 for his charitable services to the arts.
"It's not that opera in your own language is better," he said awhile back on a rare visit to New York. "It's that you can understand it."
For his own part, Mr. Moores has no trouble following Italian, German and French repertory in the original. But in 1970 he had an epiphany when the English Wagnerian Reginald Goodall, a cult figure in his time, conducted "Die Walkure" -- sorry, "The Valkyrie," the second part of Wagner's epic "Ring" cycle -- at the English National Opera in London.
Bowled over, Mr. Moores approached EMI, proposing to finance a complete English-language recording of the "Ring."
"It took a long time to persuade them," Mr. Moores said. "It helped that Decca had just made a sensation with Georg Solti's first complete recording of 'The Ring' and its 36 anvils. And there they were at EMI, weeping in the corner. That experience made me realize what I could do if I wanted to." Adjusted for inflation, his stake in the project came to $1 million.
Though hailed as an instant classic in its original LP format, the Goodall "Ring" was eventually dropped from the catalog. Reissued on CD, it has found a permanent home on the Chandos label, along with nearly 60 other English-language recordings of operatic masterpieces. A crackling new account of Verdi's "Don Carlos" appeared last fall. The latest release is a historic account of Handel's "Julius Caesar," starring Janet Baker; the next, due in September, will be Richard Strauss's "Ariadne on Naxos," with Christine Brewer in the title role.
Wearing quite a different hat, Mr. Moores has played Father Christmas to Opera Rara, a British label whose name is its mission statement. That imprint offers more than 50 original-language titles by Mayr, Mercadante and Meyerbeer, as well as out-of-the-way Donizetti, Rossini and Offenbach.
Mr. Moores traces his can-do spirit and much of his fortune to his billionaire father, John Moores, who began his career deciphering Morse code on the west coast of Ireland. A publicity-shy bricklayer's son, the elder Moores went on to found the Littlewoods empire in soccer betting, mail order and retail.
"The ordinary man or woman can do anything," John Moores liked to say. Proving it in World War II, he retrained his female staff of clerks to manufacture parachutes, antiaircraft barrage balloons and whatever else the War Office required, setting a pace no established supplier could approach.
As a plutocrat's son, Peter was educated at Eton College and Christ Church, Oxford, where he studied Italian and German. But his passion from an early age was opera. He was spurred on by a grandmother who liked to mimic Nellie Melba's voice on the radio, his father's cabinet of three-minute vinyl platters and the pages of the American magazine Opera News.
Beginning in the early 1950s, Mr. Moores spent three years as a production assistant at the Vienna State Opera, toting a senior administrator's briefcase and sitting in on countless rehearsals, acquiring a wealth of experience. "Everyone knew exactly what they were doing," Mr. Moores said. "They could throw the second act of Hans Pfitzner's 'Palestrina' onstage in two hours, even if they hadn't done it in three years, and that's saying something." Peopled by dozens of prelates locked in furious doctrinal debate, the scene is musically among the most complex in opera.
Summoned back to the family business in 1957, Mr. Moores worked his way up from a receiving bay to the chairman's office. Along the way, in 1964, he established the Peter Moores Foundation, supporting the arts and social causes.
"Basically I gave from my pocket," Mr. Moores said. Early on he asked the young Australian soprano Joan Sutherland, now considered a great diva of the era, if it would be rude to offer her a stipend so she could afford to turn down unwanted roles, as the great Kirsten Flagstad had been able to do thanks to a rich husband. "Joan said she wouldn't mind," Mr. Moores continued. "That's how we started. But there's a big difference between supporting a few singers and producing operas."
Rather than preserving a great estate for others to administer, Mr. Moores has lately been spending down. A grant of $23 million went to Kenneth Branagh's militantly pacifist, ardently ecological English-language film of Mozart's "Magic Flute."
"He is a beautifully complex man," Mr. Branagh wrote by e-mail from the set of his current action-fantasy, "Thor." "He knows the value of money and the cost of artistry. He is a shrewd judge of ideas and talent.
"His gift is to combine pragmatism with poetry. He and his impressive team were rigorous in their assessment of the financial approach to 'The Magic Flute' but also wildly imaginative in their response to the concept. At the beginning he asked me many searching questions, didn't necessarily expect answers to them all, and then he left me alone creatively."
The film features standout performances by Joseph Kaiser as the virtuous prince Tamino, an electrifying Lyubov Petrova as the Queen of the Night and Rene Pape as Sarastro, here a philosopher-general all too conscious of the vanity of human wishes. Yet the world at large gave the Branagh "Flute" the cold shoulder. Seemingly a natural for PBS, it has been in distribution limbo for four years. Now the American rights have been sold to Regent Releasing, a distributor of niche films, which plans to distribute it around November.
Beyond opera, Mr. Moores has bestowed his largesse on the fine arts. His single most impressive monument is the art gallery Compton Verney, in Warwickshire, housed in a Neo-Classical mansion built by the Scottish architect Robert Adam on grounds laid out by the English landscape architect Capability Brown. On view are permanent collections of British portraiture, Chinese antiquities, Northern European medieval art, masterpieces of the Neapolitan golden age (1600-1800), and British folk art and textiles.
"Compton Verney makes a nice destination for a day in the country," Mr. Moores said, "and it's easy to get to by public transport." The British folk art, he said, is proving a special hit with children. "Granny takes the kids upstairs, they look at the pigs and the barbershop signs, and then they filter down. They've had fun. They're not bored. And at that point they're ready to look at the Chinese bronzes."
But for the longtime pet projects of the Peter Moores Foundation, it is beginning to feel like the end of an era if not the end of the road. Money is not the only consideration.
"From choice of repertory to final mix and marketing, Peter has always been there every step of the way," Ralph Couzens, the managing director of Chandos, said recently from London. "He casts with care, sometimes waiting years for the right talent to come along."
Mr. Moores attends every recording session, policing the diction for clarity, requesting the odd word change in a translation and insisting on sound effects that help tell the story: a knock on a door here, a clatter of swords there. The attention to details pays off in a vivid theatricality that sometimes harks back to the golden-age Victrola discs that Mr. Moores grew up on.
"We want to create something that will stand the test of time," Mr. Couzens said. "In the beginning, the Opera in English series got a lot of criticism from the original-language snobs, but sales are increasing all the time, and more prestigious artists are asking to take part." (Not that the backlist is shabby, with star turns by the likes of Janet Baker, Jane Eaglen, Gerald Finley, Simon Keenlyside, Philip Langridge, Kiri Te Kanawa and Ms. Sutherland.) The series even has a fan base abroad among listeners who may not speak English but say they love the recordings just for the overall quality of the performances.
Although the wish list Mr. Moores compiled for Opera in English decades ago is almost complete, Mr. Couzens said, many more works might be added. "But I doubt we could ever find someone with his vision," he said. "The whole thing is so personal to Peter and has his stamp all over it. Maybe it should end here?"
Stephen Revell, the managing director of Opera Rara, is less willing to call it quits. "Opera Rara is currently looking for other individuals, trusts and foundations and organizations who can take over where Peter leaves off," he said." We are confident that with luck on our side, Opera Rara can continue to flourish. There is still much to do."
As Mr. Moores has shown, passionate connoisseurship is not enough. The tycoon's killer instincts count, too.
"I make recordings to get people to know opera," he said. "It's no good just recording operas I like or operas I think you should like. Opera Rara reaches a quiet opera audience that is very loyal. We don't have to work so hard with them. But the operas in English are for the nonspecialist. We have to figure out what people will want to buy. If people don't buy, we're not doing a good job of getting them to know opera."

Abstract: [...] despite individual efforts by some states to tax soda pop, promote farm stands, require healthier school lunches or mandate calorie information in chain restaurants, obesity rates in the United States are growing. Fast-food restaurants can charge lower prices for value meals of hamburgers and French fries than for salad because the government subsidizes the corn and soybeans used for animal feed and vegetable oil, says Barry Popkin, a professor of nutrition at the Gillings School of Public Health at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

Full text: WHY are Americans getting fatter and fatter? The simple explanation is that we eat too much junk food and spend too much time in front of screens -- be they television, phone or computer -- to burn off all those empty calories.
One handy prescription for healthier lives is behavior modification. If people only ate more fresh produce. (Thank you, Michael Pollan.) If only children exercised more. (Ditto, Michelle Obama.)
Unfortunately, behavior changes won't work on their own without seismic societal shifts, health experts say, because eating too much and exercising too little are merely symptoms of a much larger malady. The real problem is a landscape littered with inexpensive fast-food meals; saturation advertising for fatty, sugary products; inner cities that lack supermarkets; and unhealthy, high-stress workplaces.
In other words: it's the environment, stupid.
"Everyone knows that you shouldn't eat junk food and you should exercise," says Kelly D. Brownell, the director of the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at Yale. "But the environment makes it so difficult that fewer people can do these things, and then you have a public health catastrophe."
Dr. Brownell, who has a doctorate in psychology, is among a number of leading researchers who are proposing large-scale changes to food pricing, advertising and availability, all in the hope of creating an environment conducive to healthier diet and exercise choices.
To that end, health researchers are grappling with how to fix systems that are the root causes of obesity, says Dee W. Edington, the director of the Health Management Research Center at the University of Michigan.
"If you take a changed person and put them in the same environment, they are going to go back to the old behaviors," says Dr. Edington, who has a doctorate in physical education. "If you change the culture and the environment first, then you can go back into a healthy environment and, when you get change, it sticks."
Indeed, despite individual efforts by some states to tax soda pop, promote farm stands, require healthier school lunches or mandate calorie information in chain restaurants, obesity rates in the United States are growing. An estimated 72.5 million adults in the United States are obese, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Last year, about 27 percent of adults said they were obese, compared with about 20 percent in 2000, as reported in a C.D.C. study published this month. And, the report said, obesity may cost the medical system as much as $147 billion annually.
So what kind of disruptive changes might help nudge Americans into healthier routines? Equalizing food pricing, for one.
Fast-food restaurants can charge lower prices for value meals of hamburgers and French fries than for salad because the government subsidizes the corn and soybeans used for animal feed and vegetable oil, says Barry Popkin, a professor of nutrition at the Gillings School of Public Health at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
"We have made it more expensive to eat healthy in a very big way," says Dr. Popkin, who has a doctorate in agricultural economics and is the author of a book called "The World Is Fat: The Fads, Trends, Policies and Products That Are Fattening the Human Race."
The inflation-adjusted price of a McDonald's quarter-pounder with cheese, for example, fell 5.44 percent from 1990 to 2007, according to an article on the economics of child obesity published in the journal Health Affairs. But the inflation-adjusted price of fruit and vegetables, which are not subject to federal largess, rose 17 percent just from 1997 to 2003, the study said. Cutting agricultural subsidies would have a big impact on people's eating habits, says Dr. Popkin.
"If we cut the subsidy on whole milk and made it cheaper only to drink low-fat milk," he says, "people would switch to it and it would save a lot of calories."
Health experts are also looking to the private sector. On-site fitness centers and vending machines that sell good-for-you snacks are practical workplace innovations that many companies have instituted.
On a more philosophical level, innovative companies are training managers not to burn out employees by overworking them, says Dr. Edington of the University of Michigan.
"Stress comes up. It can lead to overeating and obesity," Dr. Edington says. At companies that see employee health as a renewable resource, he adds, managers encourage employees to go home on time so they can spend more time with their families, communities or favorite activities. "Instead of going home with an empty tank, you can go home with the energy that we gave you by the way we run our business," he says.
CORPORATE-SECTOR efforts aren't entirely altruistic. It's less expensive for businesses to keep healthy workers healthy than to cover the medical costs of obesity and related problems like diabetes. For employees at I.B.M. and their families, for example, the annual medical claim for an obese adult or child costs about double that of a non-obese adult or child, says Martin J. Sepulveda, I.B.M.'s vice president for integrated health services.
I.B.M. has been promoting wellness for employees since the 1980s. But in 2008, it began offering a new program, the Children's Health Rebate, to encourage employees to increase their at-home family dinners, their servings of fruits and vegetables, and their physical activities, as well as to reduce their children's television and computer time.
In addition to helping prevent obesity in children, Mr. Sepulveda says, the program is aimed at employees who might neglect to exercise on their own but would willingly participate as part of a family project. Each family that completes the program receives $150.
All of these ideas sound promising. But the architecture of obesity is so entrenched that policy makers, companies, communities, families and individuals will need to undertake a variety of efforts to displace and replace it, says Alan Lyles, a professor at the School of Health and Human Services at the University of Baltimore.
And American efforts can seem piecemeal compared with those in Britain, where the government has undertaken a multipronged national attack, requiring changes in schools, health services and the food industry.
Britain now places restrictions on advertising fatty, sugary and salty foods during children's shows, for example. And by 2011, cooking classes will be mandatory for all 11- to 14-year-old students in the nation. The hope is to teach a generation of children who grew up on prepared foods how to cook healthy meals, and perhaps to make eating at home -- instead of at the local fried fish-and-chips shop -- the default option.

Full text: Over the next two decades, 78 million Americans will quit working, quit paying into the Social Security system and start drawing benefits, straining the resources of our public pension system.
Is there a way to persuade them to stay in the labor force -- continuing to contribute their skills and talent -- and postpone their Social Security payments?
Yes, there is, and Chile is showing us how. Sixty-two percent of Chilean men ages 60 to 69 were still in the work force in 2004, compared with 46 percent of American men that age. Among men ages 70 to 74, 31 percent of Chileans were still working, but only 19 percent of Americans.
Why the difference? Chile has a public retirement system, but after retirement age -- 65 for men, 60 for women -- people who keep working are no longer required to contribute to a pension fund. This increases their net wages, strongly encouraging them to continue working. Since 1981, when Chile put the system in place, labor force participation rates for men ages 65 to 70 have risen 13 percentage points.
Chilean public pensions are set up differently from Social Security. Workers contribute 10 percent of their wages to an individual account and choose a fund in which to invest it, earning a market rate of return. In retirement, workers can receive inflation-protected annuities or withdraw the money gradually. Workers can receive payments early (and stop contributing), once their retirement accounts are large enough to provide a pension that is at least 70 percent of their average wages and 150 percent of the government-guaranteed minimum benefit. But a man under age 65, or a woman under 60, who has not reached this target replacement rate cannot receive benefits -- and therefore must keep working.
In contrast, Americans can start receiving Social Security benefits at age 62, but if they keep working, they must keep contributing. And if they earn more than a minimum amount, they also see a reduction in their current monthly benefit. Both the early pension option and the earnings penalty discourage work.
Disabled Chilean pensioners, who, like disabled Americans, receive benefits before reaching retirement age, are likewise allowed to work and keep any wages earned, in addition to their disability benefits.
In a similar fashion, Chilean widows receive both their own pension benefits and their survivor's benefit -- unlike American widows, who must choose one or the other. That means Chilean women get a higher expected return on their contributions to the pension system, which helps explain why labor force participation rates for older women in Chile are growing even faster than those for men.
By postponing the age at which the pension can start, reducing the payroll tax on people over 65 and eliminating other penalties for work, the United States could also encourage older people to work. This would increase national income, expand the tax base, ease the financial burden on Social Security and help to finance pensions for our increasingly long lives. -- ESTELLE JAMES, senior fellow with the National Center for Policy Analysis

Full text: LONDON -- The British economy showed signs of strengthening Thursday after reports that the country's budget deficit shrank at a faster pace than expected in July and retail sales posted the biggest gain in five months.
The government's net borrowing declined to $:3.17 billion ($5 billion) in July from $:5.52 billion a year earlier, according to the Office for National Statistics. The deficit was smaller than some economists had expected.
Retail sales, meanwhile, rose 1.1 percent in July from a month earlier, helped by sales of sporting equipment, toys and jewelry. The pound gained against the dollar and the euro.
There was also positive news Thursday from Germany, where the central bank raised its growth forecast for the year to about 3 percent from 1.9 percent.
Germany's gross domestic product rose at the fastest pace since 1991 in the second quarter because of growing demand for its goods around the world.
The positive figures in Britain came just a week after the Bank of England cut its growth outlook and said it would consider more emergency stimulus if needed.
The central bank said the economic recovery would be "choppy" as banks had been slow to increase lending and the pace of a recovery in the United States and Europe remained uncertain.
Britain's economic data continued to be mixed. Consumer confidence, for example, fell to a 15-month low in July, and recent housing data indicated that prices were starting to decline.
"We've been pushed around by the data slightly," said Michael Taylor, a senior economist at Lombard Street Research in London. "But looking through all the noise," he added, "the data is still consistent with below-trend growth. The deficit might come in slightly lower this year, but it's still large and headwinds for consumers remain."
Among those headwinds is a plan by the chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, to reduce the government's deficit from 11 percent of gross domestic product to 2.1 percent over the next five years.
The plan, which is to be presented in more detail in October, would also include large job cuts in the public sector.
Economists disagreed about whether the budget cuts would stifle Britain's fragile economic recovery and push the country back into recession. An increase in the sales tax next year is expected to stoke inflation, which is already above the government's target of 2 percent and higher than in euro zone countries.
Higher inflation has made it more difficult for the Bank of England to decide whether to keep its benchmark interest rate at a record low of 0.5 percent, and has prompted an intense debate among policy makers.
The Bank of England governor, Mervyn A. King, has said that the central bank has been "surprised" by the large increases in consumer prices.
Mr. King said he continued to believe that the price increases were temporary, and caused mainly by weakness in the pound that has increased the price of imports and oil.
Some economists, including the departing chief of the Office for Budget Responsibility, who is in charge of economic forecasts for the Treasury, have said that a threat of a double-dip recession remained in Britain.
Others contend the economy has enough momentum to avoid a new downturn.
David Kern, economist for the British Chambers of Commerce, said the July figures on the budget deficit and retail sales were encouraging, but they did not alter the view that the British economy faced a difficult road ahead.
"While these figures show an improvement compared to a year ago, they also highlight the U.K.'s massive deficit and the major challenge in restoring stability to the public finances," Mr. Kern said, adding that there was "no room for complacency."

Abstract: In a single distressed neighborhood in each city, Mr. Obama explained, high-quality schools would be integrated into a network of early-childhood programs, parenting classes, health clinics and other social services, all focused on improving educational outcomes for poor children.

Full text: HOW much evidence does the government need before trying something new in the troubled realm of public education? Should there be airtight proof that a pioneering program works before we commit federal money to it -- or is it sometimes worth investing in promising but unproven innovations?
Last month, the Senate subcommittee that allocates federal education money weighed in on one such promising innovation, slicing, by more than 90 percent, the $210 million that President Obama requested for next year for his Promise Neighborhoods initiative.
Mr. Obama first proposed Promise Neighborhoods in the summer of 2007, pledging that, as president, he would help create in 20 cities across the country a new kind of support system for disadvantaged children, paid for with a mix of private and public money. In a single distressed neighborhood in each city, Mr. Obama explained, high-quality schools would be integrated into a network of early-childhood programs, parenting classes, health clinics and other social services, all focused on improving educational outcomes for poor children.
The Obama administration requested and received from Congress $10 million for the program for fiscal year 2010, and the Department of Education used that money to create a national competition for up to 20 Promise Neighborhoods planning grants. Although the grants were capped at a modest $500,000, the response to the program was overwhelming -- 339 nonprofit groups and institutions of higher education from across the country formed coalitions, raised matching funds and filed applications.
Promise Neighborhoods was inspired by the example of the Harlem Children's Zone, which over the last decade has compiled a solid, though still incomplete, record of success in the 97 blocks of central Harlem where it operates. Students at the group's two charter elementary schools, mostly low-income and almost all black or Hispanic, have achieved strong results on statewide tests, often exceeding average proficiency scores for white students. Last year, 437 parents completed Baby College, the Zone's nine-week parenting class, and 99 percent of the children graduating from the prekindergarten entered kindergarten on grade level. This fall, more than 200 students from the Zone's afterschool programs will enroll as freshmen in college.
The central argument against fully financing the Promise Neighborhoods initiative, given voice in recent weeks by various policy groups, journalists and bloggers, is that despite such promising data, the Zone has not yet proved itself.
This case was made most forcefully in a report from the Brookings Institution that came out a week before the Senate committee's vote. The report acknowledged that the charter schools at the heart of the Zone have, indeed, substantially raised test scores for the children enrolled in them.
But the report also argued that the scores are not as high as those at some other charter schools in Manhattan and the Bronx that don't include the kind of coordinated system of early-childhood programs, family support and neighborhood improvements offered by the Harlem Children's Zone.
It is no coincidence that charter schools in and near the Harlem Children's Zone have earned such impressive results. Over the last few years, thanks in part to intensive recruiting by the New York City schools chancellor, Joel Klein, Harlem and the Bronx have become a mecca for a highly successful class of charter schools, all run, to some degree, on the model of the nationwide, nonprofit Knowledge is Power Program: extended hours, energetic young teachers, an emphasis on discipline and character-building, as well as heavy doses of reading and math.
These schools embody the attractive theory that we might be able to erase the achievement gaps between black and white children and between poor and middle-class children with nothing more than new and improved schools. But despite their robust test scores, there continue to be debates over whether these charter schools work for the most disadvantaged children in neighborhoods like Harlem, and no one has yet demonstrated whether the KIPP model could succeed at the scale of an entire school system.
Geoffrey Canada, the founder of the Harlem Children's Zone, premised his organization on the idea that schools like KIPP's, though needed, are not enough on their own. To solve the problem of academic underperformance by low-income children, he argues, we must surround great schools with an effective system of additional services for poor families.
These two strategies -- call them the KIPP strategy and the Zone strategy -- are not fully in opposition; they borrow ideas and tactics from each other. But they do represent distinct theories, both new, both promising and, at this point, both unproven.
So, at this moment of uncertainty and experimentation, should the federal government wait, as critics of Promise Neighborhoods suggest, until ironclad evidence for one big solution exists?
Or should it create a competitive research-and-development marketplace to make bets on innovations, the way the government did during the space race and in the early days of the Internet, and allow the most successful strategies to rise to the top? In his 2007 speech, Mr. Obama made it clear that he envisioned Promise Neighborhoods as precisely this kind of laboratory. "Every step these cities take will be evaluated," he proposed, "and if certain plans or programs aren't working, we will stop them and try something else."
A certain skepticism with regard to innovation is always wise, especially in public education, where highly touted new programs often turn out to be disappointments. The problem is that for low-income and minority Americans, the status quo is a deepening calamity. The New York state test results released last month showed that the gap in reading scores between black and white elementary- and middle-school students grew from 22 percentage points in 2009 to 30 points in 2010, while the math gap grew from 17 points to 30 points.
In May, the National Center for Education Statistics reported that in the nation's high-poverty schools, the average graduation rate for 12th-grade students fell from 86 percent in 2000 to 68 percent in 2008, while the rate in low-poverty schools remained stable at about 91 percent.
The declining prospects of the country's poor and black students can't be blamed on belt-tightening by Congress. In fact, the budgets for the two main federal programs designed to improve the performance of low-income children, Title I and Head Start, have risen steadily for the last 40 years, through Republican administrations and Democratic ones. According to a new report by Educational Testing Service, the combined Title I and Head Start budgets grew in inflation-adjusted dollars from $1.7 billion in 1970 to $13.8 billion in 2000. This year's budget was $21.7 billion.
Head Start, which provides preschool programs to poor families, is a prime example of the Senate committee's true attitude toward evidence-based decision-making. In January, the Health and Human Services Department released a study of Head Start's overall impact. The conclusions were disturbing. By the end of first grade, the study found, Head Start graduates were doing no better than students who didn't attend Head Start. "No significant impacts were found for math skills, pre-writing, children's promotion, or teacher report of children's school accomplishments or abilities in any year," the report concluded.
And how did the Senate panel react to this dismal evidence? They set aside $8.2 billion for Head Start in 2011, almost a billion dollars more than in 2010. Of course, the fact that Congress spends billions of dollars each year on unproven programs does not itself argue that the government should start spending hundreds of millions of new dollars on new unproven programs. But it does undercut the argument that federal education dollars should be reserved only for conclusively proven initiatives.
Children who live in the 300-plus low-income neighborhoods that are pursuing Promise Neighborhoods support are, on the whole, stuck. Every year, their schools and Head Start centers receive more federal money, and every year, things in their neighborhoods get worse. Rather than stick with the same strategies and hope things somehow magically change, Congress should find more room in the budget to support the Obama administration's declared approach: to try new strategies and abandon failed ones; to expand and test programs with strong evidence of success, even if that evidence is inconclusive; and to learn from mistakes and make adjustments as we go.

Full text: Producer prices for finished goods rose slightly in July, the first such increase in three months, according to government data released on Tuesday, helping to ease some concerns about the possibility of deflation.
The Labor Department's Producer Price Index rose 0.2 percent last month, compared with a 0.5 percent decline in June. Prices for finished foods, excluding volatile food and energy prices, rose 0.3 percent, exceeding forecasts of 0.2 percent. The price rise of the core index was the largest gain since January.
The index tracks prices of goods received by producers before they are passed on to consumers, and it helps to analyze the prospects for price pressures on the economy.
Taken with the Consumer Price Index on Friday, which also showed an increase for July, the report should help ease concerns among some Federal Reserve officials about the possibility of a drop in prices and salary, or deflation.
Still, Nigel Gault, the chief United States economist for IHS Global Insight, said the threat remained.
"Deflation is clearly a risk, but it is not here yet," Mr. Gault said. "It depends on how much growth we get in the economy moving forward."
Bernard Baumohl, the chief global economist at the Economic Outlook Group, said the possibility of deflation was remote.
"I am not taking concerns of deflation all that seriously," Mr. Baumohl said. "The global economy is out of the recession phase. It is growing, admittedly slowly, but it is still growing and I expect economic activity will pick up more momentum."
"The dilemma is, Where is the economy headed later this year and into 2011? What we are focused on is the outlook," Mr. Baumohl said.
The rise in the price index last month was attributed to increases in consumer foods, which rose 0.7 percent, with most of the price rises for fresh and dried vegetables. The last time the overall index rose was in March, when it had a 0.8 percent increase.
On Friday, the Labor Department said the Consumer Price Index rose 0.3 percent in July on a seasonally adjusted basis, and 1.2 percent in the last 12 months. When energy and food prices are subtracted, the core index rose 0.1 percent in July, after rising 0.2 percent in June.
The Federal Reserve said last week that it expected inflation to remain subdued for some time. With that expectation, the Fed has kept the federal funds rate near zero since December 2008.
With inflation well below the Fed's implicit target of around 2 percent, many economists, including committee members of the central bank, have spoken of concerns that the economy could instead be at risk of declining wages and prices.
Last week, the Fed, saying its confidence in the recovery had dimmed, announced plans to buy long-term government debt by using the proceeds from its mortgage bond portfolio.
Kevin H. Giddis, the executive managing director and president of fixed-income capital markets at Morgan Keegan & Company, said the Fed move helped put Tuesday's rise in the price index in context.
"In the past, I may have been concerned that the uptick in P.P.I. would trickle down to consumer prices, but not today," Mr. Giddis said.
"As has been made abundantly clear by the economic data released in recent weeks and, more to the point, the Fed's decision to restart quantitative easing, inflation should be the least of our worries right now," he said in a research note.
A separate report from the Federal Reserve on Tuesday showed that output from manufacturing, a sector that has been a bright spot in the recovery, increased 1.1 percent in July after falling 0.5 percent in June. A large contributor to the jump in output was an increase of nearly 10 percent in the production of motor vehicles and parts. Over all, industrial production rose 1 percent last month.
The statistics were the latest to reflect an economy in a period of sluggish recovery. Recent macroeconomic data has highlighted the impact of factors including government stimulus, labor market weakness and households struggling with debt.
In the housing sector particularly, factors including government tax credits, demand, and debt burdens have had an impact on construction and sales.
A third report from the Commerce Department on Tuesday showed that housing starts rose 1.7 percent in July to the seasonally adjusted annual rate of 549,000. Permits declined 3.1 percent, a 14-month low.
"Financial distress on the part of many households, ongoing labor market weakness and vicious competition from an enormous overhang of existing homes all point to a very tough slog for home builders in the months and quarters ahead," said Joshua Shapiro, the chief United States economist for MFR Inc.

Abstract: Disappointed with his low savings deposit rate, a 29-year-old chemical company salesman named Zhang Zhenlei says he took $19,000 out of his savings account last November and bought into a higher-yielding investment trust through his bank's wealth management division. Aware of the risks, Chinese regulators are pressing state-run banks to raise billions of dollars in capital to cushion any downturn -- a task that could be complicated by any perceptions among private investors that the banks are exposed to a lot of risky debt.

Full text: SHANGHAI -- Disappointed with his low savings deposit rate, a 29-year-old chemical company salesman named Zhang Zhenlei says he took $19,000 out of his savings account last November and bought into a higher-yielding investment trust through his bank's wealth management division.
The money, the bank told him, would help finance two government highway and infrastructure projects.
"They told me the details and which companies would get the loans," Mr. Zhang said. "And they told me the risk was under control."
But last month, the China Banking Regulatory Commission issued a sharp warning, ordering investment trust companies to stop selling such products in cooperation with banks. Regulators were apparently worried that banks and trusts were forming partnerships and using products like the one sold to Mr. Zhang to, in effect, finance loans without calling them loans.
The government evidently suspected that banks were using such maneuvers to evade rules put in place this year to rein in rampant lending and excess credit. Those conditions have been cited as a reason for rising property prices and overall inflation.
Regulators, suspecting that banks and trusts are secretly repackaging old loans and moving them off bank balance sheets, are concerned that financial institutions in China may have engaged in the same sort of financial engineering that got Western banks into trouble.
On Aug. 10, government overseers acted again, ordering banks to move any off-balance-sheet loans back onto their books and to make provisions to safeguard against a rise in bad loans, according to a copy of the government order given to The New York Times by an industry expert.
Several weeks ago, the Fitchcredit rating agency warned that such off-balance-sheet deals were understating the size of bank lending in China and thereby masking the risks associated with an increase in dodgy loans.
Fitch estimates that Chinese banks had about $350 billion in trust-related products on their balance sheets at the end of June, and that much of that lending had not been publicly disclosed.
"Regardless of how the transaction is structured, credit is disappearing from bank balance sheets, resulting in pervasive understatement of credit growth," a Fitch analyst, Charlene Chu, wrote in a June presentation. "Credit risk has not disappeared but merely been transferred to investors."
The off-balance-sheet deals are raising warning flags about a possible slowdown here. While China's economy remains robust -- it overtook Japan in the second quarter to become the world's second-largest economy, behind the United States -- analysts worry that a surge in bank lending last year and early this year might have led to wasteful spending on infrastructure and real estate projects.
In recent years, the government has been trying to crack down on what it deems wasteful spending on "luxurious" local government buildings, highways to nowhere and so-called image projects that are constructed in poverty-stricken areas.
The basis for these worries was laid last year, after the government encouraged aggressive lending as part of a huge economic stimulus package. The result was a record $1.4 trillion in new bank loans in 2009, about double the previous year. Some analysts fear the sharp increase in lending included many bad loans that will begin to show up over the next few years.
Aware of the risks, Chinese regulators are pressing state-run banks to raise billions of dollars in capital to cushion any downturn -- a task that could be complicated by any perceptions among private investors that the banks are exposed to a lot of risky debt. The government is also conducting stress tests to determine how banks will perform if property prices plummet.
Beijing is now trying to restrict lending and ease asset price inflation without setting off a slowdown.
"They're stuck in a policy bind," says Michael Pettis, a professor of finance at Peking University in Beijing, noting China's heavy dependence on investment-driven growth. "They have to choose between cleaning things up and maintaining high growth."
Pushing in the opposite direction are banks and investment trusts, which want to continue pumping money into the economy to bolster their profits. Analysts say they have been adept at evading the rules with clever and complex financial products.
Even though most banks contacted in recent weeks said they had stopped offering such products, several said they had found ways to continue to sell them. Analysts say it is unclear just how pervasive such products are.
Something similar happened here in the 1990s, when aggressive financing by banks and investment trusts led to big losses, huge bankruptcies and new regulations.
Chinese banks appear to be stronger this time around. Over the last decade, huge restructuring and government recapitalization efforts allowed the big state banks to clean up their balance sheets and eventually raise billions of dollars in public stock offerings.
Still, analysts say the lack of transparency about lending makes it difficult for investors and regulators to assess the risks facing some banks.
"Essentially what you had was a bank using a trust company to package that bank's own loans into a wealth management product, which was then sold to its own customers," says Jason Bedford, a manager at KPMG in Beijing. "The problem is you don't have a clear transfer of risk off of the balance sheet."
With the help of trusts, banks are repackaging loans as investments, analysts say, thereby making room to issue additional loans. And trusts are turning to wealthy bank clients to raise new capital.
Banking customers are also contributing to the continued use of partnerships between banks and investment trusts, analysts say. These customers, which include corporate clients, have been frustrated with the low yields they earn on savings deposit -- close to 2 percent -- and with the dearth of alternative investment options. Higher-yielding investment trusts were seen as ideal.
"Banks have a lot of demands from high-net-worth depositors," particularly big corporate accounts, Mr. Bedford at KPMG said.
Stephen Green, a Shanghai-based analyst at Standard Chartered Bank, describes investment trusts as financial intermediaries, filling in gaps in the financial markets and acting as a jack of all trades -- part hedge fund, mutual fund, private equity firm and bank lender.
Trusts are also a vital source of financing for private companies, and lately real estate developers, which often have a difficult time securing loans from state-owned banks -- largely because the government is trying to restrain real estate development.
But many investment trusts are state-owned, and they often finance state infrastructure projects. For instance, the Xi'an Trust, which is owned by the government in the city of Xi'an, is providing money for land, water and electricity projects to build a new high-tech base for the city.
For wealthy investors like Zhang Zhenlei, though, investment trusts offer attractive interest rates, about double the savings deposit rate.
Mr. Zhang, who is a V.I.P. client at his state-owned bank, says he spent a half hour filling out paperwork so that he could invest in a trust and help finance an infrastructure company in Inner Mongolia and also a highway development company in southern China's Guangdong Province.
"It turned out very well," says Mr. Zhang, who has already gotten his money back, with interest payments, after the six-month lockup period ended.
As for the crackdown on trust products, regulators may have difficulty, analysts say. A wealth manager at I.C.B.C., one of China's biggest state-owned banks, was offering investment trusts to banking clients two weeks ago.
"Now we have a 57-day trust product with a yield rate of 2.6 percent," the manager told one prospective client over the phone. "It's available from today. Though financial products aren't authorized for principal to be guaranteed, usually we can orally guarantee your principal."

Full text: KARACHI, Pakistan -- Even as the government and international relief workers struggle to get food and clean water to millions of flood-stricken Pakistanis, concerns are growing about the enduring toll of the disaster on the nation's overall economy, food supply and political stability.
More rain fell on Monday, adding to the worst flooding in memory and confronting Pakistan with a complex array of challenges, government and relief officials warned. Though they range over the immediate, medium and long term, nearly all need to be addressed urgently.
Providing clean water for millions and avoiding the spread of diseases like cholera are the first priorities. But there are also looming food shortages and price spikes, even in cities. There is also the danger that farmers will miss the fall planting season, raising the prospect of a new cycle of shortfalls next year.
"There was a first wave of deaths caused by the floods themselves," said Maurizio Giuliano, a United Nations spokesman. "But if we don't act soon enough, there will be a second wave of deaths," caused by a lack of clean water, food shortages and diseases transmitted by water or animals.
"The picture is a gruesome one," Mr. Giuliano said.
The prospect of immediate hunger combining with long-term disruptions to food supplies was a chief concern. The situation confronting Maqbool Anjum, 50, a small-scale wheat farmer in the Khanpur area of southern Punjab Province, was typical.
For the time being, he said in an interview by telephone: "We don't have food rations in our house. There isn't a single grain of flour with us right now."
For the last three weeks, he said, he and his family have survived on bread and pickles. There was no dry wood to light a fire in the stove. "What we're doing is breaking off legs from our wooden bed and using that."
No one from the government or any relief organization had contacted them. Still, in less than two months, he and his brothers are supposed to reseed the soil on about eight acres they own for next year's wheat harvest. That may be impossible now.
His seeds are lost, as is the cotton crop on part of that land, along with any income it may have brought. Two of his brothers' homes were destroyed. For the time being he would try to survive on his wife's salary of $50 a month as a health worker. But the prospect of mounting debt seemed inevitable.
"It'll take three to four years before we can grow anything on our land again," he said.
Of the 4,000 people in his village, half of them also own agricultural land and were similarly wiped out.
His struggle is multiplied by many millions across the country. The floods have submerged about 17 million acres of Pakistan's most fertile croplands, in a nation where farming is an economic mainstay. The waters have also killed more than 200,000 head of livestock, and washed away large quantities of stored commodities that feed millions throughout the year.
Relief workers warned that if farmers like Mr. Anjum missed the deadline to reseed in the fall planting season, the nation could face long-term shortages.
"If we miss, we're in real trouble," said David Doolan, a senior officer of the United Nations' Food and Agricultural Organization in Pakistan. "We need to ensure livelihoods, so that next year we're not still saving lives."
The United Nations has appealed for $460 million in international donations, but only about a third of that has been provided so far. Relief officials were clearly concerned that donations from abroad would fall short of what was needed, especially when compared with those for relief of other recent disasters, like the earthquake in Haiti.
"An earthquake is a much more dramatic, emotional, telegenic event because it happens so quickly," said John Holmes, the humanitarian aid coordinator at the United Nations. In Pakistan's case, he said, "What is clear is that we need a lot more, and we need it quickly."
It seems impossible that the country could absorb the cost of the calamity on its own. Bridges, power plants and communications networks have been lost or severely damaged across the country, a fifth of which is estimated to be under water. Arbab Alamgir Khan, Pakistan's minister for communications, said damage to roads alone was estimated at $76 million.
The loss of even nonfood crops, like cotton for the nation's textile industry, could undercut the nation's ability to recover.
With 20 percent of cotton washed away, Pakistan's famed textile industry, which accounts for 60 percent of the country's exports, is certain to stagger. As a result, textile plants are likely to make large-scale layoffs. Plants that do manage to purchase cotton will face electricity shortages, as more than seven major power stations have been demolished.
While dire conditions threaten rural communities, severe inflation and shortages of fresh produce loom for even large urban centers relatively unaffected by the floods, like Karachi.
Karachi relies on Punjab for about 70 percent of its fresh foods and has fed itself on food stored in warehouses since the floods arrived in late July. But even those supplies will be depleted by the end of this week, according to local officials and wholesale food suppliers, and the small quantities of Punjab produce that survived the floods are now held up by disruptions in transportation.
Already, prices of fresh foods have more than doubled in Karachi's markets, and the city's food retail association and government officials expect prices to rise by a multiple of six within the next week.
Farid Qureshi, who heads the Karachi Retail and Grocers Group, said that he had not received packaged milk since July, and that his inventory would run out in less than a week. His own company supplies packaged milk to 35 percent of Karachi's retail market.
"Obviously the government hasn't told the public the retail situation is this bad," he said.
Agriculture experts say the government may have to import rice for the first time in more than a decade.
Shoaib Bukhari, a provincial minister in charge of food pricing in Sindh Province, has pleaded with wholesalers and retailers to adhere to prices fixed by the government. But he expected the worst.
"May God bless me, but there will be a catastrophe here in the next five to 10 days," he said. "There will definitely be a hue and cry here, strikes and large-scale problems. We'll be hiding somewhere, and people will be beating up the city government."
Making matters worse, the squeeze comes during Ramadan, the monthlong Muslim fasting season, when families normally hold elaborate evening meals to break the daytime fast.
Adding to Karachi's worries and potential volatility, many of those displaced by the floods in rural areas have migrated here. Last summer, when monsoon rains paralyzed the city for three days, residents responded by attacking the offices of Karachi's power supply company.
Economists argue that the only viable solution, as is often the case in Pakistan, will be international loans that allow at least five-year concessions for Pakistan to pay off the debt.
"There are no other alternatives, unless the world wants Pakistan to become an even more unstable state," said A. B. Shahid, a retired economist who has advised the National Accountability Bureau, the nation's primary anticorruption organization.
Instability is a worry both for the government and for its foreign allies. The regions suffering most from the crisis are far more likely to breed militancy, according to a study by the Sustainable Development Policy Institute, based in Islamabad. It found that the 20 districts with the worst food insecurity were also home to the worst militancy. In many of those places, hard-line Islamic charities have stepped in.
"It's the mullah-Marxist nexus," said Abid Suleri, the head of the institute and one of the nation's leading experts on food insecurity. "It's a class conflict exploited by mullahs who say, 'If you are living in misery, it's better to at least kill the infidels.' "

Abstract: Today's debt problems," wrote Olivier J. Blanchard, the chief economist, and Carlo Cottarelli, the fund's head of fiscal affairs, in an essay published in The Financial Times, "result not from how fiscal policy was managed during the crisis, but from how it was mismanaged before the crisis. [...] there are many who will not be helped.

Full text: As 2010 began, there was nearly unanimous agreement in financial circles on at least one thing: Interest rates were sure to rise during the year.
Quite to the contrary. As Labor Day approaches, interest rates have collapsed, plunging along with economic optimism.
That turn of events, which has shocked savers and stunned investors, appears to indicate that financial markets' worries are turning in a very different direction from those of many governments.
The governments are seeking ways to bring down budget deficits, fearing that without austerity they could go so far into debt that they would never be able to borrow again. Investors in the financial markets seem to be much more concerned by the possibility of renewed recession and a general deflation that could send asset values and prices down.
That market reaction is the opposite of what happened in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Then "bond vigilantes" were reluctant to invest in United States Treasury securities because they feared runaway inflation. Their refusal drove up the interest rates the government had to pay on its borrowings and eventually led the Federal Reserve, under Paul A. Volcker, to wage war against inflation even if it meant choking off economic growth.
Now, far from showing a reluctance to finance the American government, investors are seeking safety and evidently believe American government debt is the safest possible investment. They have rushed to send money to the Treasury, thereby reducing borrowing costs for the government.
By late 2009, interest rates had fallen to levels previously thought inconceivable. The annual yield on a two-year Treasury note dipped below 1 percent. But it has since traded barely above one-half percent.
Perhaps investors are nervous because they fear governments will swing too far toward austerity. When economies weakened three years ago, talk immediately turned to economic stimulus. This time, much of the discussion in Washington, as well as in many European capitals, has focused on the need to reduce spending and deficits, rather than on the possibility that additional stimulus might be needed to avert a new worldwide downturn.
The new British government has announced plans for sharp spending reductions aimed at narrowing deficits and government borrowing, even as the Bank of England has said the growth outlook is dimming.
Deficit hawks are leaning forward in the United States as well. "Many Americans and most senators feel that the level of the federal debt is at crisis levels," Senator Lamar Alexander, a Tennessee Republican, said in a Senate debate last month, adding that the debt "threatens the security of our country."
Much of the new international worry about government spending was prompted by the Greek debt crisis this year. It avoided default only with help from other European countries. That aid was conditioned on Greece agreeing to a strong austerity program, to be monitored by a group including representatives of the International Monetary Fund.
The I.M.F. has often prescribed austerity for countries in trouble, but last week two senior officials of the fund sought to slow the push for spending reductions in major economies. They challenged the perception that national budgets are in trouble because of the bailouts and fiscal stimulus programs that were enacted to combat the financial crisis.
"Today's debt problems," wrote Olivier J. Blanchard, the chief economist, and Carlo Cottarelli, the fund's head of fiscal affairs, in an essay published in The Financial Times, "result not from how fiscal policy was managed during the crisis, but from how it was mismanaged before the crisis."
Countries, they said, should have built up savings when times were good. The two officials argued for restraint in imposing austerity programs now, advocating the adoption of fiscal reforms that will have their largest impact in later years.
The problems that confronted Greece could not precisely replicate themselves in either the United States or Britain. Both borrow in their own currencies, which they could print if others were reluctant to make loans.
It would be disastrous if either country got to the point that investors abandoned it, or even drove up interest rates sharply by scaling back their support. But precisely the opposite has happened this year.
That interest rates have declined is good news in many respects. "There are," said Sal Guatieri, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets, "always people who have jobs who can take full advantage of lower interest rates to borrow and spend."
But that impact now may be weakened by two factors, perhaps increasing the need for fiscal stimulus.
First, there are many who will not be helped. Homeowners with ample equity and income can refinance their mortgages at record low rates, which fell to 4.4 percent last week. But millions of homeowners either lack sufficient income or have houses no longer worth what is owed on the mortgage. They cannot refinance.
And while government borrowing costs have plunged in the countries deemed safest by investors, they have risen in some others. Germany now pays 1.4 percent on five-year borrowings, while Greece pays more than 11 percent. The German economy is booming, while the Greek recession is worsening.
The second negative factor from lower interest rates now is harder to quantify, but may be of growing importance. Those people who depend on their savings to provide income now earn far less from their thrift than they used to receive. Some avoided sharp declines by purchasing longer-term certificates of deposit from banks. But as those C.D.'s mature, the banks are offering low rates even on long-term deposits.
The growing disenchantment with government spending has led to talk of the world reaching a "Keynesian endpoint," as Anthony J. Crescenzi, a strategist for Pimco, a large investment firm, put it this summer. At such a time, countries needing to rescue banks and stimulate their economies would be unable or unwilling to do so.
The Federal Reserve's move last week, in which it committed to buying up a small amount of Treasury securities, showed its determination to act but "may have exacerbated the fears," said Dean Maki, the chief United States economist for Barclays Capital. "The Fed seemed to have significantly downgraded its economic outlook," but its policy change "appeared fairly minor in comparison."
Lower interest rates are already helping some companies. I.B.M. is paying only 1 percent to borrow $1.5 billion for three years. And as some investors search for better yields, many companies are benefiting. Last week, a record $14.3 billion of new bonds were issued around the world by companies with bond ratings lower than investment grade, Thomson Reuters reported.
At the same time, new stock issues have declined. Still, stock prices are slightly below where they were at the end of 2009, when many analysts expected a better recovery than seems to be unfolding. The new concerns have manifested themselves more in bond prices than in stock levels.
Economics is a notoriously uncertain discipline. It is possible that a surprisingly strong employment report, or some other unanticipated event, could begin to disperse the fog of economic pessimism that has engulfed investors and sent interest rates to record lows.
But for now, the financial markets seem to fear recession and deflation much more than they fear deficit spending.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- A lone dissenter on the Federal Reserve's policy-making committee warned Friday that the central bank's monetary strategy could backfire and touch off a new boom-and-bust cycle.
Thomas M. Hoenig, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, dissented on Tuesday when the Federal Open Market Committee voted 9 to 1 to invest proceeds from the Fed's mortgage-bond portfolio in longer-term Treasury debt. The decision was the Fed's clearest signal yet that its confidence in the pace of the recovery was waning.
"Monetary policy is a useful tool, but it cannot solve every problem faced by the United States," Mr. Hoenig told local Chamber of Commerce members in a speech at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln. "In trying to use policy as a cure-all, we will repeat the cycle of severe recession and unemployment in a few short years by keeping rates too low for too long."
Mr. Hoenig added: "I wish free money was really free and that there was a painless way to move from severe recession and high leverage to robust and sustainable economic growth, but there is no shortcut."
While Mr. Hoenig's view is far from the mainstream, the timing of his comments -- coming three days after the committee's vote -- signals the difficulties the Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, will probably face in forging a consensus on monetary policy especially in a climate that Mr. Bernanke has called "unusually uncertain."
As president of the Kansas City Fed since 1991, Mr. Hoenig is the longest-serving of the 12 district bank presidents. He is known as an "inflation hawk," meaning that his foremost concern tends to be preventing inflation, the Fed's traditional enemy. Among his allies in that position are several other presidents -- Charles I. Plosser of Philadelphia, Richard W. Fisher of Dallas and Jeffrey M. Lacker of Richmond. None of the three currently vote on the Federal Open Market Committee, where 11 of the 12 Fed presidents share four voting seats through an annual rotation. (The New York Fed president is a permanent member.)
Right now, inflation has been running well below the implicit Fed target of around 2 percent -- so low that a few committee members fear that the economy could instead be at risk of tumbling into deflation. Deflation is a spiral of declining wages and prices, akin to what Japan has experienced since the 1990s.
"In judging how we approach this recovery, it seems to me that we need to be careful not to repeat those policy patterns that followed the recessions of 1990-91 and 2001," Mr. Hoenig said. "If we again leave rates too low, too long, out of our uneasiness over the strength of the recovery and our intense desire to avoid recession at all costs, we are risking a repeat of past errors and the consequences they bring."
The Fed has kept its benchmark short-term interest rate -- the federal funds rate, at which banks lend to each other overnight -- near zero since December 2008. Starting in March 2009, the Fed has stated that the rate is likely to remain "exceptionally low" for "an extended period."
Voting on the committee, Mr. Hoenig has dissented since January, arguing that the "extended period" language had the effect of setting unsafe expectations in the markets.
"To be clear, I am not advocating a tight monetary policy," Mr. Hoenig said in his speech on Friday. "I am advocating a policy that remains accommodative but slowly firms as the economy itself expands and moves toward more balance. I advocate dropping the 'extended period' language from the F.O.M.C.'s statement and removing its guarantee of low rates. This tells the market that it must again accept risks and lend if it wishes to earn a return."
Peter N. Ireland, a professor at Boston College and a former economist at the Richmond Fed, said he was unconvinced. "While there are risks, certainly, of higher inflation down the road, I agree with the consensus that deflation is much more of a concern," he said. "The policy he is calling for is quite off the mark."
Professor Ireland said he feared that Mr. Hoenig's comments might inadvertently complicate efforts by Mr. Bernanke and other officials to present a unified message. "There's a tremendous amount of confusion right now, amongst the public and in the financial markets, as to what the Fed is seeing vis-a-vis the economy right now," he said. "This is not to say that dissent is not allowed, but just to say that the way the dissent is being presented to the public seems highly counterproductive right now."

Abstract: The economic reports, on business inventories, retail sales and the Consumer Price Index, were in much the same vein as those that Wall Street had been seeing throughout the week, including trade deficit figures that raised the likelihood that the estimate for second-quarter growth of 2.4 percent would be revised sharply lower.

Full text: Stocks fell for a fourth straight day Friday after new economic statistics reinforced a picture of a sluggish recovery in the United States.
The economic reports, on business inventories, retail sales and the Consumer Price Index, were in much the same vein as those that Wall Street had been seeing throughout the week, including trade deficit figures that raised the likelihood that the estimate for second-quarter growth of 2.4 percent would be revised sharply lower.
As earnings season winds down, traders are increasingly relying on the indicators for some hint of how the American economy is performing. "But if you take the totality of the last couple of weeks, it is providing more concern over the strength of the recovery," said Paul Ballew, a former Federal Reserve economist and a senior vice president for Nationwide Insurance.
At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average, which went into the red for the year on Wednesday, was down 16.80 points, or 0.16 percent, at 10,303.15. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was 4.36 points, or 0.4 percent lower, at 1,079.25 and the Nasdaq composite index was down 16.79 points, or 0.77 percent at 2,173.48.
Interest rates were lower. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 21/32, to 99 19/32, and the yield fell to 2.67 percent, from 2.75 percent late Thursday.
The Dow and the S.& P. were down more than 3 percent for the week, while the Nasdaq was down 5 percent.
Health care, technology and consumer discretionary stocks were 1 percent lower. Home Depot was down 30 cents, at $27.31, and Microsoft fell 9 cents, to $24.40. J. C. Penney was down 98 cents, to $19.82. Kohl's was down $1.51, to $44.99, and Nordstrom's fell $2.39, to $31.05.
"Frankly we are in a consumer-driven slowdown right now and there is not much we can do in the short term to change that," said Eric Beder, associate director of equity research for Brean Murray, Carret & Company. "With consumers worried about keeping their jobs, and looking at potential tax increases next year, there is no real impetus to buy right now."
"Right now there is tremendous uncertainty in the market," he added.
On Friday, retail inventories, which rose 0.8 percent in June, compared with 0.5 percent in May, were the latest indicator to point to weakening growth in the gross domestic product. Although an increase, analysts said that it was not enough to offset weaknesses in other sectors. Business inventories increased 0.3 percent in June over all, but sales fell 0.6 percent.
"This is further confirmation that the estimate of G.D.P. growth will be revised down," the chief United States economist at HSBC, Kevin Logan, said of the inventory numbers. He estimated that total inventories for the quarter would be $25 billion less than initial government assumptions.
In another closely watched report, retail sales rose 0.4 percent in July, slightly less than expectations of a 0.5 percent increase. It came after a 0.3 percent decline in June. But when subtracting volatile gasoline and automobile sales, retail sales fell 0.1 percent in July.
Joshua Shapiro, the chief United States economist for MFR, said that the retail data showed a deceleration in the economy.
"Our own view is that the labor market recovery will be a grudging one, that consumers will enjoy only small gains in wages and salaries for some time, and that consumer spending growth will therefore be modest at best," he said in a research note.
A statement Friday from the Commerce secretary, Gary Locke, underscored the administration's concerns about the economy. Mr. Locke said that the retail sales figures showed the economy was growing at a more modest pace than the administration would like.
"The administration understands that too many Americans continue to struggle," Mr. Locke said. "President Obama and this department are committed to continuing to promote policies that foster job creation and a strong and sustainable economy."
In a third report, the Labor Department said that the Consumer Price Index, which is considered a benchmark measure of inflation, rose 0.3 percent in Julyon a seasonally adjusted basis, and 1.2 percent in the last 12 months.
If the volatile energy and food prices are subtracted, the core index, which is used to gauge inflation, rose 0.1 percent in July, after rising 0.2 percent in the previous month. The 12-month change in the core index remained at 0.9 percent for a fourth month. The numbers were in line with market expectations.
"It is evidence of a slow recovery with quite a bit of slack in terms of capacity," Mr. Ballew said.
Consumer sentiment in August rose slightly above market expectations, to 69.6 in August, according to the Reuters and University of Michigan consumer sentiment index. It was 67.8 in July.

Abstract: [...] I'd argue that loose talk by some Fed officials is already having a negative economic impact.

Full text: Ten years ago, one of America's leading economists delivered a stinging critique of the Bank of Japan, Japan's equivalent of the Federal Reserve, titled "Japanese Monetary Policy: A Case of Self-Induced Paralysis?" With only a few changes in wording, the critique applies to the Fed today.
At the time, the Bank of Japan faced a situation broadly similar to that facing the Fed now. The economy was deeply depressed and showed few signs of improvement, and one might have expected the bank to take forceful action. But short-term interest rates -- the usual tool of monetary policy -- were near zero and could go no lower. And the Bank of Japan used that fact as an excuse to do no more.
That was malfeasance, declared the eminent U.S. economist: "Far from being powerless, the Bank of Japan could achieve a great deal if it were willing to abandon its excessive caution and its defensive response to criticism." He rebuked officials hiding "behind minor institutional or technical difficulties in order to avoid taking action."
Who was that tough-talking economist? Ben Bernanke, now the chairman of the Federal Reserve. So why is the Bernanke Fed being just as passive now as the Bank of Japan was a decade ago?
Now, America's current economic troubles aren't exactly identical to those of Japan in 1999-2000: Japan was experiencing outright deflation, while we aren't -- yet. But inflation is well below the Fed's target of around 2 percent, and it is continuing to slide. And Americans face a level of unemployment, and sheer human misery, far worse than anything Japan went through.
Yet the Fed is doing almost nothing to confront these troubles.
What could the Fed be doing? Back when, Mr. Bernanke suggested, among other things, that the Bank of Japan could get traction by buying large quantities of "nonstandard" assets -- that is, assets other than the short-term government debt central banks normally hold. The Fed actually put that idea into practice during the most acute phase of the financial crisis, acquiring, in particular, large amounts of mortgage-backed securities. However, it stopped those purchases in March.
Since then, the economic news has grown steadily worse. And earlier this week, the Fed changed course -- but barely. It now says that it will reinvest the proceeds from maturing securities in long-term government bonds. That's a trivial change, basically the least the Fed could get away with without facing a firestorm of criticism -- and far short of the major asset-purchase program the Fed should be undertaking.
Back in 2000, Mr. Bernanke also suggested that the Bank of Japan could move expectations by making announcements about its future policies. In particular, he argued that it could make private-sector borrowing more attractive by announcing that it would keep interest rates low until deflation had given way to 3 percent or 4 percent inflation -- an idea originally suggested by yours truly. Since we are, if anything, in worse shape now than Japan was in 2000, an inflation target of at least 3 percent would very much be in America's interest. But as chairman of the Fed, Mr. Bernanke has explicitly rejected any such move.
What's going on here? Has Mr. Bernanke been intellectually assimilated by the Fed Borg? I prefer to believe that he's being political, unwilling to engage in open confrontation with other Fed officials -- especially those regional Fed presidents who fear inflation, even with deflation the clear and present danger, and are evidently unmoved by the plight of the unemployed.
And in fairness to Mr. Bernanke, discord among senior officials also makes it difficult for policy to change expectations: it would be hard to credibly commit to higher inflation if this commitment were constantly being undercut by speeches out of the Richmond or Dallas Feds. In fact, I'd argue that loose talk by some Fed officials is already having a negative economic impact. But while Mr. Bernanke doesn't have the authority to stop that loose talk, he could make it clear that it doesn't represent overall Fed policy.
Last, but not least, policy is suffering from an act of neglect by President Obama, who waited until his 16th month in office before offering a full slate of nominees to fill vacancies on the Federal Reserve Board. If he had filled those slots quickly -- his nominees still aren't in place -- the Fed might be less passive.
But whatever the reasons, the fact is that the Fed -- which is required by statute to promote "maximum employment" -- isn't doing its job. Instead, like the rest of Washington, it's inventing reasons to dither in the face of mass unemployment. And while the Fed sits there in its self-inflicted paralysis, millions of Americans are losing their jobs, their homes and their hopes for the future.

New Jobless Claims Highest Since February

Full text: WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- The number of workers filing new claims for jobless benefits unexpectedly rose last week to the highest level in close to six months, the latest evidence the economy's recovery was faltering.
The increase in jobless claims added to worries in the stock market, which has failed to make any gains this year.
The number of new claims for state unemployment insurance rose by 2,000, to 484,000 in the week ended Aug. 7, the second consecutive increase, the Labor Department said Thursday. Economists had expected claims to edge down to 469,000.
"This is not a good number," said John Brady, an analyst at MF Global in Chicago. "Claims are going the wrong way. That has the market concerned."
While prices for United States government debt eased as investors locked in recent gains, the dollar rose broadly Thursday as traders worried about the global outlook sought a safe haven.
The Federal Reserve said Tuesday that the economy's recovery was likely to be more modest than expected and that it would take additional steps to support growth.
Casting a further cloud over the global outlook, the euro zone's statistical agency said Thursday that industrial production in the 16-nation currency bloc declined in June, an indication that growth could have softened as a generally vigorous second quarter ended.
Economic data for the United States has been decidedly weak over the last couple of months, with private sector job growth lagging expectations and the unemployment rate stuck at 9.5 percent. That has fed concerns that the economy could be at risk of a renewed recession or could face a debilitating bout of deflation as the bleak job market pressures incomes and prices.
"Whatever recovery we have seen is an outgrowth of inventory restocking and government largess and neither one is sustainable," said Bob Andres, chief investment strategist at Merion Wealth Partners in Berwyn, Pa.
The Labor Department said in a separate release that a rise in oil prices pushed the cost of imported goods higher in July for the first time in three months, though at half the pace economists had expected.
Import prices rose 0.2 percent last month after falling 1.3 percent in June and a revised 0.8 percent in May. That left the three-month cumulative total down 2.0 percent, the largest decline since the three months ended February 2009.
Oil import prices rose 2 percent last month after falling for two months. In recent days, oil prices have been declining.
Prices excluding oil fell 0.2 percent in July, signaling a lack of underlying inflation pressure from imports.
In its report on jobless claims, the department said a four-week moving average of new filings, which economists prefer because it smoothes out weekly fluctuations, rose 14,250, to 473,500. Like the initial claims figure, that was the highest level since the week ended Feb. 20.

Full text: The Bank of England cut its economic growth forecast Wednesday, in part blaming the uncertain pace of the recovery in the United States and the rest of Europe.
Meanwhile, the dollar fell to a 15-year low against the yen, contributing to a sharp sell-off of stocks in Tokyo.
The central bank in Britain now forecasts annual growth to peak at 3 percent, less than the 3.6 percent it had predicted in May. It also said inflation would remain above the bank's 2 percent target until the end of next year, longer than previously predicted, before falling below the target in 2012.
The Bank of England cited uncertainty about the United States recovery among its reasons for cutting its forecast for British economic growth. Banks are being slow to increase lending as they find it difficult to raise financing themselves. Planned austerity programs in Britain and the Continent, Britain's top trading partner, have further dimmed the economic outlook.
The Bank of England held its benchmark interest rate at the record low of 0.5 percent last week and kept a $:200 billion ($313 billion) stimulus package unchanged.
"There are clearly risks," Mervyn King, the Bank of England governor, said Wednesday, hinting that the central bank might consider expanding its stimulus package to support the economy. "Business and consumer sentiment have shown signs of softening, measures of financial fragility remain elevated and there is great uncertainty about the outlook for both the U.S. and our most important trading partner, the euro area."
The recovery in the United States has run into trouble, economists say, because a lack of confidence keeps consumers and businesses from stepping in where government stimulus packages left off.
"At this point policy makers should have reinstated confidence," said Karen Ward, senior global economist at HSBC in London, "but the private sector isn't taking up the baton in a way we'd hoped."
While the United States trade deficit widened 18.8 percent in June, as exports fell during the month and imports grew, many analysts said the global economy could no longer count on American consumers to serve as the primary engine of growth. And it is not clear if China is prepared to step into the breach. The latest developments there indicate that the efforts of policy makers in Beijing to restrain lending are beginning to pay off. But some experts worry they might have gone too far.
The announcement from London came a day after the Federal Reserve said it would use the proceeds from its huge mortgage-bond portfolio to buy long-term Treasury securities in a bid to support the faltering economy. The action is intended to keep long-term interest rates down and to stimulate borrowing. But it caught some traders off guard.
"It actually shakes confidence and raises questions about the future," said Joe Battipaglia, a market strategist at Stifel Nicolaus in New York.
Stock markets retreated Wednesday in a wave that swept across the globe. The Nikkei index fell by 2.7 percent; the Eurostoxx 50 index of blue chips closed down 2.6 percent; and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was off 2.82 percent.
For now, it is unlikely that the Bank of England or the European Central Bank will take similar actions to the Fed's. But at least in Britain, the central bank is more likely to revert to asset purchases, known as quantitative easing, than raising interest rates, said Howard Archer, chief economist for Britain and Europe at IHS Global Insight in London.
The Fed's downgrade of its view of the American economy also prompted investors to sell the dollar on expectations that interest rates would remain low well into next year, making it less desirable for foreigners to hold American debt. After declining more than 10 percent against the yen in the last three months, the dollar dropped to 84.72 yen on Wednesday, the lowest level since April 1995.
In Japan, the dollar's decline has ignited fears that too strong of a domestic currency could harm the country's recovery, led by exporters like Toyota. It has also fed speculation that the Japanese government might intervene to weaken its currency. A strong yen hurts Japanese exporters by making their goods more expensive overseas and by eroding the value of their repatriated earnings.
On Wednesday, the Japanese finance minister, Yoshihiko Noda, said he was "closely watching" currency markets.

Full text: CORRECTION APPENDED
WASHINGTON
Six months into his second term as chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben S. Bernanke is finding it tough to get ahead of the curve.
Under his direction, the central bank shifted course on Tuesday, setting aside its talk of eventually tightening credit and taking a mostly symbolic step to help the flagging recovery. But on Wednesday, the Dow Jones industrial average fell nearly 2.5 percent as investors seemed to pay more attention to the Fed's gloomier outlook than to its willingness to take new action.
Having failed in 2007 to anticipate the subprime mortgage crisis and the economic havoc that resulted, Mr. Bernanke is eager not to seem slow or complacent as the recovery shows signs of stalling. But compared with three years ago, the Fed's options now are more limited, and the consequences of acting (or not) potentially more dangerous.
"The challenges the Fed faces aren't going to get any easier in the coming months," said Carl E. Walsh, a professor of economics at the University of California, Santa Cruz. "The choices ahead are only getting worse as the economy seems to be slowing down."
In agreeing to use proceeds from the Fed's vast mortgage-bond portfolio to buy long-term Treasury securities, the Federal Open Market Committee surprised some economists, who had expected the central bank's policy makers to wait until their next meeting, in September.
But in some ways, the decision on Tuesday was a fairly easy one for the Fed. It assuaged officials, like the presidents of the Fed district banks in Boston and New York, who are worried about the incipient threat of deflation. But it also was acceptable to inflation hawks, because it means that the Fed will own fewer mortgage bonds and more government debt, the traditional mainstay of its portfolio.
What happens next could be far less palatable. Using its power to create money, the central bank bought $1.25 trillion in mortgage-backed securities, $175 billion in debts owed by government-controlled enterprises like Fannie Mae, and $300 billion in Treasury securities from January 2009 to March 2010.
By buying debt, the Fed pushed bond prices upward and pushed long-term interest rates downward, as bond yields move inversely to price.
That strategy of buying financial assets to increase the money supply and stimulate economic growth is what economists call quantitative easing because it tends to loosen credit.
It was a new tactic for the Fed, and in the coming months, Mr. Bernanke, who had hoped to be done with the asset purchases, will have to decide whether a new round is warranted. Even he has expressed uncertainty about whether the strategy will carry diminishing returns.
Professor Walsh noted that economists "don't have a lot of good historical episodes in modern economies to know exactly what the effects of quantitative easing are."
"What we have is an example of the detrimental effects of failing to engage in quantitative easing: the Great Depression," he said.
Mr. Bernanke, a student of the Depression, has long argued that the central bank has additional tools, even after lowering short-term interest rates to zero, to avoid deflation.
But to some, the Fed has been using those tools inappropriately.
"What is holding back the economy today has nothing to do with standard macroeconomic policy," said William Poole, former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. "It's a consequence of the enormous -- unprecedented since the 1930s -- uncertainty about the regulatory regime."
Mr. Poole called the Fed's action this week "essentially meaningless, quite frankly," adding that he did not believe it would help stimulate the economy.
"I would never have accumulated the big portfolio of mortgage-backed securities in the first place," said Mr. Poole, who retired in 2008, before the crisis hit. "To me, the appropriate function of the central bank is to provide generalized liquidity, and not support for particular sectors, which is properly a fiscal policy decision."
Mr. Poole's view is openly shared, so far, by only one member of the committee: Thomas M. Hoenig, the president of the Kansas City Fed, who was the lone dissenter when the committee voted this week.
But others might also look askance at another round of quantitative easing. At a speech in June, Kevin M. Warsh, a member of the Fed's board of governors, said the Fed's institutional credibility could be at risk if it expanded its balance sheet beyond its current $2.3 trillion.
Mr. Warsh also said that further asset purchases might foster "perceptions of monetizing indebtedness," printing money to pay off the public debt.
Mr. Walsh, of the University of California, acknowledged that concern but said it did not pose a threat -- yet.
"On a very simple level, the Fed is printing money so the Treasury can spend more than it's collecting in tax revenues," Mr. Walsh said. "Relative to the total size of the federal deficit, this is a small part, and these are highly unusual circumstances, so no one is too worried about it. But it is always a temptation to use the central bank to finance government expenditures."
Mr. Walsh raised other concerns about further quantitative easing. He said the strategy might not appreciably influence long-term interest rates, which are already low. Or any impact might be transitory.
If banks were to withdraw the $1 trillion they hold at the Fed too quickly, it could generate inflation. Moreover, Mr. Walsh said, "changes in expectations about future inflation can influence current inflation, even if the economy is below its potential."
In the worst case, he said, the economy could return to the stagflation of the late 1970s, when prices rose as growth lagged.
Of course, where some observers fear excessive boldness in Mr. Bernanke, others see an unacceptable timidity. "I think the Fed has been intellectually behind the curve," said Albert M. Wojnilower, an economist who worked for the New York Fed from 1951 to 1962. "Except when the crisis was at its worst, the Fed has been worried about future inflation, when all along, that has been the wrong worry."
He added: "They have been expecting the world to assume the shape that their models predict, a world in which 'animal spirits' are overflowing. In the U.S., we have the opposite problem."

Correction: September 23, 2010, Thursday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A news analysis article on Aug. 12 about policy choices confronting the Federal Reserve misstated the year that William Poole, former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, retired. It was 2008, not 2007. A reader pointed out the error in an e-mail message on Wednesday.

Full text: HONG KONG -- In the latest signs that the Chinese economy is beginning to cool after setting a torrid pace in the first half of this year, several government indicators slowed slightly last month, Beijing announced on Wednesday.
The July indicators for industrial output, retail sales, fixed-asset investment and bank lending all provided a fairly consistent snapshot of a country where economic growth remains the strongest in the world, but where the nearly manic spending of the last few months is starting to fade.
A gradual slackening in retail sales and fixed-asset investment last month, together with a weakening of imports that was announced on Tuesday, pointed to more caution by consumers and investors alike in China. Exports continue to surge, creating the prospect that China may once again rely on foreign buyers to sustain rapid economic growth and limit unemployment.
The moderation in China's economic growth is no accident. A series of government policies, as varied as limits on bank loans and restrictions on real estate investments, have been aimed at preventing the economy from overheating, which could fan inflation.
But an imbalance in China between strong exports and weakening domestic demand could rekindle trade tensions with industrialized and developing countries, economists said. Unemployment remains a problem in many other countries, not just the United States, that find themselves buying ever more from China.
Particularly unexpected in the data on Wednesday was the restraint that Chinese banks showed in issuing new loans, which in turn contributed to slower growth in the money supply. Banks issued 533 billion renminbi ($78.7 billion) in new loans last month, down from 603.4 billion renminbi ($89.1 billion) in June.
A broad measure of money supply, M2, rose 17.6 percent in July compared with a year earlier after being up 18.5 percent in June.
"We believe this level of broad money supply growth is clearly too restrictive, as it will put more downward pressure on domestic demand growth in the near future," two Goldman Sachs economists, Yu Song and Helen Qiao, wrote in a research note.
The gradual slowing in China is evident in the factories that have turned the country into the manufacturing center of the world. Industrial output rose 13.4 percent last month compared with the same month last year.
By comparison, industrial output had been up 13.7 percent in June from a year earlier, after rising 16.5 percent in May.
Much the same pattern was evident in fixed-asset investment, which was up 24.9 percent last month compared with a year earlier. It had been ahead by 25.5 percent in June.
Retail sales rose 17.9 percent in July compared with the same month last year, as Chinese consumers with rising wages continued to flock to stores. But sales had grown 18.3 percent in June compared with a year earlier, and had been up 18.7 percent in May.
Chinese policy makers have long feared that inflation could lead to social unrest, and have tailored many policies to prevent it. Consumer prices were up 3.3 percent in July from a year earlier, accelerating from an increase of 2.9 percent in June.
But there were signs that inflation could begin to moderate. Producer prices were 4.8 percent higher in July than a year ago, after being up 6.4 percent in June and 7.1 percent in May.
Many businesses are complaining about rising costs, which may hurt their willingness to invest. Alex Yu, a senior manager at the Dongguan Jet Power Metals and Plastics Factory in Dongguan, China, said that wages had climbed 20 to 30 percent in the last year while the cost of an indispensable kind of raw plastic had soared 23 percent.
"Everything is getting more and more expensive, we feel the impact of inflation in all areas of our business," he said.
On Tuesday, China's General Administration of Customs announced that the country's trade surplus reached $28.7 billion last month, the highest level since January 2009.
Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, who has repeatedly called for a more confrontational trade strategy toward China, said in a statement late Tuesday that China's latest trade numbers "show just how little motive China has to end its currency manipulation unless it is pushed to do so."

Full text: The following is the full text of the statement released Tuesday by the Federal Reserve:
Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in June indicates that the pace of recovery in output and employment has slowed in recent months. Household spending is increasing gradually, but remains constrained by high unemployment, modest income growth, lower housing wealth and tight credit. Business spending on equipment and software is rising; however, investment in nonresidential structures continues to be weak and employers remain reluctant to add to payrolls. Housing starts remain at a depressed level. Bank lending has continued to contract. Nonetheless, the committee anticipates a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization in a context of price stability, although the pace of economic recovery is likely to be more modest in the near term than had been anticipated.
Measures of underlying inflation have trended lower in recent quarters and, with substantial resource slack continuing to restrain cost pressures and longer-term inflation expectations stable, inflation is likely to be subdued for some time.
The committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends and stable inflation expectations, are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period.
To help support the economic recovery in a context of price stability, the committee will keep constant the Federal Reserve's holdings of securities at their current level by reinvesting principal payments from agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in longer-term Treasury securities. The committee will continue to roll over the Federal Reserve's holdings of Treasury securities as they mature.
The committee will continue to monitor the economic outlook and financial developments and will employ its policy tools as necessary to promote economic recovery and price stability.
Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Ben S. Bernanke, chairman; William C. Dudley, vice chairman; James Bullard; Elizabeth A. Duke; Donald L. Kohn; Sandra Pianalto; Eric S. Rosengren; Daniel K. Tarullo; and Kevin M. Warsh.
Voting against the policy was Thomas M. Hoenig, who judges that the economy is recovering modestly, as projected. Accordingly, he believed that continuing to express the expectation of exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period was no longer warranted and limits the committee's ability to adjust policy when needed. In addition, given economic and financial conditions, Mr. Hoenig did not believe that keeping constant the size of the Federal Reserve's holdings of longer-term securities at their current level was required to support a return to the committee's policy objectives.

Abstract: More detailed information is posted on the Economix blog Wages Are Rising Again In the deep economic slump of the mid-1970s, the average hourly pay of rank-and-file workers -- who make up four-fifths of the work force -- fell 6 percent, adjusted for inflation.

Full text: One of the distinctive features of the Great Recession has been the enormous number of people who have been out of work for months on end. Almost 45 percent of today's unemployed workers have been without a job for at least 27 weeks. In no other downturn since World War II did the share exceed 26 percent.
For many of these long-term unemployed, the financial and psychological damage will last for years. For most other workers, however, the situation has had a perverse, and mostly overlooked, silver lining.
Unemployment has been concentrated among a surprisingly small number of people, given how deep the recession has been. The nation's pool of jobless workers has not been constantly changing. Instead, it's been relatively stable -- mostly because the hiring rate of new workers plunged in 2008 and still has not recovered. The drop in hiring has actually been steeper than the rise in layoffs.
Compare the current slump with that of the early 1980s, which was similar in severity. Over the course of 1980, 18.1 percent of the labor force was unemployed at some point. In 2008, the first year of this slump, only 13.2 percent was, according to the Labor Department's most up-to-date data. That number surely rose in 2009, but it is unlikely to have come close to the 1982 peak of 22 percent.
If anything, the slowdown of the recovery in the last few months has made the recession even more concentrated. It has put off the day when the job market will be strong enough to re-employ many of the long-term jobless. But inflation has fallen to zero, which helps the purchasing power of everyone fortunate enough to have a job.
Given that the economy seems to have entered this new phase -- a new slog -- I wanted to use this week's column to sketch an updated portrait of the economy. The highlights follow. More detailed information is posted on the Economix blog
Wages Are Rising Again
In the deep economic slump of the mid-1970s, the average hourly pay of rank-and-file workers -- who make up four-fifths of the work force -- fell 6 percent, adjusted for inflation. In the early 1980s, the average wage fell 3 percent. Even in the mild 1990-91 recession, it fell almost 2 percent.
But since this recent recession began in December 2007, real average hourly pay has risen nearly 5 percent. Some employers, especially state and local governments, have cut wages. But many more employers have continued to increase pay.
Something similar happened during the Great Depression, notes Bruce Judson of the Yale School of Management. Falling prices meant that workers who held their jobs received a surprisingly strong effective pay raise.
This time around, nominal wages -- the numbers people see in their paychecks -- have risen throughout the slump, as companies have passed along some of the impressive productivity to their (remaining) workers. Meanwhile, inflation has been almost non-existent, except for parts of last year, when real wages did briefly fall.
Obviously, real wages could begin falling again if inflation picks up or more employers cut pay. And many workers are already struggling with big debts and diminished 401(k) accounts. Still, the contrast is pretty stark. The typical jobless person has been out of work six months. The typical worker has received a raise.
Central U.S. Does O.K.
The hardest-hit parts of the country have been manufacturing regions, like Michigan, Ohio and Rhode Island, and areas that had huge housing bubbles, like California, Florida and Nevada.
The least affected area is a band running from the Dakotas and Minnesota down to Texas and Louisiana. Continuing the concentration theme, this band includes some of the manufacturers and other businesses that have emerged from the recession the quickest.
This pattern probably helps explain why the Senate has taken such a leisurely approach to helping the economy in recent months. Many of the states in the best shape also have small populations and, as a result, outsize political power. In Nebraska, where the unemployment rate is 4.8 percent, there is one United States senator for every 900,000 people. In Florida, where the unemployment rate is 11.4 percent, there is one senator for every nine million people.
A White-Collar Slump
The first two years of the downturn were disproportionately blue collar. In 2008 and 2009, the construction industry shed 25 percent of its jobs, and manufacturing lost 16 percent.
This year has been different. Manufacturing -- especially of so-called durable goods, like computers and machinery, many of which are purchased by companies -- has been adding jobs.
Many white-collar fields, meanwhile, are losing jobs: state and local governments, publishing, telecommunications. Retailers have added jobs, but more slowly than the rest of the economy, as consumer spending has remained tepid.
This shift from blue to white collar is the main reason the downturn has also become more female. In a turnabout from the previous two years, male employment has risen by almost one million this year, while female employment has fallen by 300,000. For similar reasons, employment has risen this year among people who never attended college and fallen among those who did.
Over all, though, the downturn has still exacted a much harsher toll on the less educated. The unemployment rate for college graduates is still just 4.5 percent, and the gap between their pay and everyone else's is larger than it has ever been. For most college graduates, the Great Recession has not lived up to its name.
And there is good reason: in today's high-tech, global economy, educated workers remain very much in demand. They make their companies more productive and the American economy more competitive. They expand the size of the economic pie.
If you have doubts, take a look at the last century. In the early 20th century, Europe decided that a high school education would be wasted on the masses. The United States instead made high school universal, and its newly skilled work force helped build everything from the hugely productive factories of the Midwest to modern Hollywood to the world's most innovative retail and technology sectors.
Over the long term, the best response to the current downturn, by far, would be for the country to regain the global lead in education.
Of course, that will take years, maybe decades. It will not come soon enough to help the seven million people who have been out of work -- and are still actively looking for work -- for six months or more.
They will need a different kind of help. Maybe it's a new kind of jobless benefit, like a lump-sum payment that is fairly generous but still them gives an incentive to find new work as soon as possible. Or maybe it's a new kind of retraining program that, unlike so many past failures, lives up to its promises.
Whatever it is, it will need to be something more innovative than the current safety net -- which was, after all, created for a very different kind of downturn.

Abstract: The July indicators, for industrial output, retail sales, fixed asset investment and bank lending, all provided a fairly consistent snapshot of a country where economic growth remains the strongest in the world, but where the nearly manic spending of the last few months is starting to fade.

Full text: HONG KONG -- In the latest signs that the Chinese economy is beginning to cool after setting a torrid pace in the first half of this year, several government indicators slowed slightly last month, Beijing announced Wednesday morning.
The July indicators, for industrial output, retail sales, fixed asset investment and bank lending, all provided a fairly consistent snapshot of a country where economic growth remains the strongest in the world, but where the nearly manic spending of the last few months is starting to fade.
A gradual slackening in retail sales and fixed asset investment last month, together with a weakening of imports that was announced on Tuesday, pointed to more caution by consumers and investors alike in China. Exports continue to surge, creating the prospect that China may once again rely on foreign buyers to sustain rapid economic growth and limit unemployment.
The moderation in China's economic growth is no accident. A series of government policies, as varied as limits on bank loans and restrictions on real estate investments, have been aimed at preventing the economy from overheating, which could fan inflation.
But an imbalance in China between strong exports and weakening domestic demand could rekindle trade tensions with industrialized and developing countries alike, economists said. Unemployment remains a problem in many other countries, not just the United States, that find themselves buying ever more from China.
Particularly unexpected in the data on Wednesday morning was the restraint that Chinese banks showed in issuing new loans, which in turn contributed to slower growth in the money supply. Banks issued 533 billion renminbi ($78.7 billion) in new loans last month, down from 603.4 billion renminbi ($89.1 billion) in June.
A broad measure of money supply, M2, rose 17.6 percent in July compared with a year earlier after being up 18.5 percent in June.
"We believe this level of broad money supply growth is clearly too restrictive, as it will put more downward pressure on domestic demand growth in the near future," said two Goldman Sachs economists, Yu Song and Helen Qiao, in a research note.
The gradual slowing in China is evident in the factories that have turned the country into the manufacturing center of the world. Industrial output rose 13.4 percent last month compared with the same month last year.
By comparison, industrial output had been up 13.7 percent in June from a year earlier, and was up 16.5 percent as recently as May.
Much the same pattern was evident in fixed asset investment, which was up 24.9 percent last month compared with a year earlier. It had been ahead by 25.5 percent in June, and 25.9 percent in May.
Retail sales rose 17.9 percent in July compared with the same month last year, as Chinese consumers with rising wages continued to flock to stores for ever more spending. But sales had grown 18.3 percent in June compared with a year earlier, and had been up 18.7 percent in May.
Chinese policy makers have long feared that inflation could lead to social unrest, and have tailored many policies to prevent it. Consumer prices were up 3.3 percent in July from a year earlier, accelerating from an increase of 2.9 percent in June.
But there were signs that future inflation could begin to moderate. Producer prices were 4.8 percent higher in July than a year ago, after being up 6.4 percent in June and 7.1 percent in May.
Many businesses are still complaining about rising costs, which may hurt their willingness to invest. Alex Yu, a senior manager at the Dongguan Jet Power Metals and Plastics Factory in Dongguan, China, said that workers' wages had climbed 20 to 30 percent in the last year while the cost of an indispensable kind of raw plastic had soared 23 percent.
"Everything is getting more and more expensive, we feel the impact of inflation in all areas of our business," he said.
On Tuesday, China's General Administration of Customs announced that the country's trade surplus reached $28.7 billion last month, the highest level since January of last year, as exports surged and while the growth in imports dwindled.
The official China Daily newspaper said in an editorial on Wednesday that the surplus showed the resilience of China's exporters but was not a reason to let the renminbi rise more quickly in value against other currencies.
The surplus "is not a reason to tout faster appreciation of the Chinese currency as a panacea," the editorial said. "The real solution to China's swelling trade surplus must include long-term reforms to enrich Chinese consumers and boost their consumption levels."
But Senator Charles E. Schumer, a New York Democrat who has repeatedly called for a more confrontational trade strategy toward China, said in a statement late Tuesday that China's latest trade numbers "show just how little motive China has to end its currency manipulation unless it is pushed to do so."

Abstract: In buying at least $10 billion a month in new Treasury securities -- a small fraction of the roughly $700 billion in Treasury debt the Fed holds -- the central bank is trying to help keep money readily available in the financial markets. The announcement on Tuesday, after the scheduled meeting of the Fed committee that sets interest rates and monetary policy, confirmed what had been widely discussed among economists and business leaders in recent days: the Fed would move more decisively if the economic picture darkened.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve officials, acknowledging that their confidence in the recovery had dimmed, moved again on Tuesday to keep interest rates low and encourage economic growth. They also signaled that more aggressive measures could follow if the job market and other indicators continued to weaken.
With short-term interest rates already close to zero, the Fed's policy makers have relatively few tools available to encourage consumer and corporate spending. So they now plan to use the proceeds from the Fed's huge mortgage-bond portfolio to buy long-term government debt.
That action may put downward pressure on long-term interest rates and stimulate borrowing. For consumers, it means mortgage rates are likely to remain at record lows for some time.
Though the immediate impact is likely to be modest, the decision is a turnabout from only a few months ago, when officials were discussing when and how to begin to raise interest rates and gradually shrink the $2.3 trillion balance sheet amassed through the Fed's response to the 2008 financial crisis.
In buying at least $10 billion a month in new Treasury securities -- a small fraction of the roughly $700 billion in Treasury debt the Fed holds -- the central bank is trying to help keep money readily available in the financial markets.
With Congress seemingly unable to agree on substantial new stimulus spending, the Fed could face a far tougher decision later this year: whether to take more drastic steps to pump money into the economy and make credit even cheaper.
"We're in a lousy middle between the economy picking up on its own and falling off a cliff," said Cathy E. Minehan, a former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. "And that makes policy-setting really hard."
The announcement on Tuesday, after the scheduled meeting of the Fed committee that sets interest rates and monetary policy, confirmed what had been widely discussed among economists and business leaders in recent days: the Fed would move more decisively if the economic picture darkened.
The Fed, led by Ben S. Bernanke, its chairman, has shifted away from its more optimistic outlook earlier this year. "The pace of recovery in output and employment has slowed in recent months," said the Federal Open Market Committee. The statement added that the nation's economic recovery was "likely to be more modest in the near term than had been anticipated."
Yields on 10-year Treasury securities, a benchmark for home mortgages and corporate loans, tumbled to their lowest level in more than a year on Tuesday. Rates on 30-year Treasuries briefly fell below 4 percent. The yield on a 10-year Treasury note dipped to 2.765 percent from 2.83 before the announcement.
Stocks regained some of their losses from earlier in the day. At its close, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 54.5 points, or 0.51 percent, to 10,644.25.
From January 2009 to March 2010, the Fed bought $1.25 trillion in mortgage-backed securities and about $175 billion in debt owed by government agencies, primarily the housing finance entities Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The Fed had planned to allow the size of that portfolio to shrink gradually as the securities matured or the debts were prepaid.
Instead, the Fed will now reinvest those principal payments in longer-term Treasury securities. (The central bank said it would continue to roll over its holdings of other Treasury securities as they mature.)
The money involved is unclear. In March, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York estimated that at least $200 billion of the mortgage-related securities and debt would mature or be prepaid by the end of 2011.
But mortgage rates have dropped since then, giving borrowers an incentive to refinance and pay off existing mortgages, so the actual figure could be substantially larger.
By not allowing its debt holdings to decline below the level of $2.054 trillion at which they stood on Aug. 4, the Fed is preventing what economists have called the passive tightening of monetary policy. The Fed still has the option, if conditions warrant, of increasing its debt purchases.
Some analysts believe that if the economy worsens, the Fed might begin a new round of quantitative easing -- the strategy of buying financial assets to increase the money supply.
In its statement, the committee said that while household spending was gradually increasing, high unemployment, modest income growth, a drop in household wealth and tight credit continued to hamper growth.
The committee said it still expected a "gradual return" to normal economic conditions, although the recovery was less robust than expected at this point.
Ethan S. Harris, an economist at Bank of America, said he was "mildly surprised" by the Fed's action -- "not that they did it but rather how quickly they decided." He added, "My expectation had been that the Fed would take a little more time to switch gears and prep the market."
The decision not to let the balance sheet shrink was a relatively easy one, Mr. Harris added. "To go back to big asset purchases is a much bigger step, and it would require clear signs that the economy is heading toward a double-dip recession."
Economists who work in the markets had a mix of reactions.
Bruce McCain, the chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank, said the Fed "steered the middle ground."
"Given the uncertainty, hopefully the middle ground calms nerves and keeps people confident enough to go ahead and spend the money that they have in productive ways," he added.
But a former New York Fed economist, John Ryding of RDQ Economics, said the announcement suggested "a bit of a feeling of panic by the Fed." And Joshua Shapiro, an economist at MFR Inc., said the Fed's announcement "appears to mainly be designed to provide itself with political cover against a backdrop of a gut-wrenching economic correction that shows no sign of ending anytime soon."
Along with additional quantitative easing, another option available to the Fed is to lower the interest rate (now 0.25 percent) it pays on the roughly $1 trillion in reserves that banks hold at the Fed.
While that action could be helpful, it carries some risk, said Christopher L. House, an economics professor at the University of Michigan.
"If they were to simultaneously lower the rate to zero while leaving $1 trillion in reserves in the banking system, they would have a lot of reason to worry about inflation," he said.
In its announcement, the Fed also left unchanged its benchmark short-term interest rate -- the federal funds rate, the rate at which banks borrow from one another overnight -- at zero to 0.25 percent, its level since December 2008. And it maintained that the rate would remain "exceptionally low" for "an extended period," the language it has been using since March 2009.
The Federal Open Market Committee's vote on Tuesday was 9 to 1. The dissenter was Thomas M. Hoenig, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City.
Mr. Hoenig, who is known for his focus on inflation, the Fed's traditional enemy, dissented for the fifth consecutive meeting, both on the extended-period language and on the decision to reinvest the mortgage-bond proceeds.

Full text: LONDON -- The central question dividing economists these days is whether Western governments should spend more to ward off a potential second recession or retrench to hold down their ballooning debts to restore confidence among investors.
But Albert Edwards, an investment strategist in London for the French bank Societe Generale, considers the debate a waste of time. To be specific, he forecasts a "bloody, deep recession" that produces a stock market collapse of at least 60 percent, followed by years of inflation of 20 percent to 30 percent as the persistent printing of money by central banks desperate to improve the situation sends prices soaring.
Mr. Edwards's sandals and chuckling demeanor belie his reputation as perhaps the City of London's best-known permabear -- a species that has long flourished on the outer margins of the financial industry but rarely inside mainstream banks.
That is no longer true.
With the shocking financial crisis of 2008 still fresh in people's minds, and gloom-spinning economists like Nouriel Roubini having achieved pop culture status, even longstanding pessimists like Mr. Edwards -- who has been forecasting a Japanese-style stock market slump in the United States since 1997 -- are being treated with newfound respect.
In many smart-money circles, listening to bears has become fashionable, especially now that doubts remain about the sustainability of the euro zone, concerns grow that the United States may slip back into recession and that even the Chinese growth engine may seize up. But to some, the popularization of extremely dire forecasts suggests that the pendulum may have swung too far.
"Nothing is ridiculous anymore," said Philippe Jabre, a hedge fund executive in Geneva. "There is no doubt that these days extremely negative research is being tolerated more."
Mr. Jabre said that most of the research that came his way had a distinctly negative bias and that finding actionable ideas with a positive spin was becoming far more difficult. "These guys are reinforcing a conviction among many who invest in hedge funds that they should remain scared," he said.
Mr. Edwards's newfound popularity reflects the trend. Once frequently shown the door by disbelieving clients, Mr. Edwards recently drew 600 investors to a conference in London.
Similarly, Bob Janjuah, the one strategist in London whose prognostications are seen by some as even more dire than those of Mr. Edwards -- "even I get depressed reading his stuff," Mr. Edwards remarked -- said he was courted by half a dozen investment banks this summer before deciding to leave his post at Royal Bank of Scotland to join Nomura. (He starts officially in October.)
"Clients are more receptive to hearing polar ends of an investment view," said Mr. Janjuah, who expects economic growth for the top developed economies to average little better than 1 percent a year over the next five years.
Further afield, Raoul Pal, a former Goldman Sachsderivatives expert and hedge fund manager, has attracted a growing following with his monthly research note that, most recently, predicted a depression in the United States similar to that of the 1930s and eventual bankruptcy for Britain.
Mr. Pal writes The Global Macro Investor from a holiday village in Valencia. a province in Spain. He said that demand was so great now that he has the luxury of doling out his high-price annual subscriptions only to clients he considers sophisticated enough to pass muster or who come recommended by people he trusts. Others must join a waiting list, Mr. Pal said, although he declined to say how large the group is.
He said that 30 percent of his clientele -- which includes pension and hedge funds, governments and proprietary traders at banks -- consisted of wealthy family offices with assets of more than $200 million.
"They are easily the most bearish of my subscribers because they invest in the longer term," he said, "and in the longer run they see more uncertainty than ever before."
According to TrimTabs, a funds researcher, hedge funds withdrew $3.5 billion in April and industry consultants say that many funds -- positioned in July for a continuum of bad market news -- were caught by surprise when the market rallied. "Where is the research telling me how good Intel's earnings were going to be?" Mr. Jabre said. "I just have not seen it."
In fact, if investors had been following the advice of Mr. Edwards or Mr. Pal over the last month as stocks have bounced back, they would have lost money, as both men readily acknowledge. Mr. Edwards has advised investors to be heavily underinvested in all equities, and Mr. Pal is betting against the United States stock market as well as shorting the euro.
Mr. Pal's bad run began when, after becoming bearish in 2007 and reaping the fruits in 2008, he was caught short by the powerful recovery that began in March 2009. To date in his model portfolio, he has lost 96 percent on a short bet of the Indian stock exchange, 68 percent betting against the Chinese H share stock market and 68 percent on the American mutual fund company Franklin Templeton. (Until 2009, he says his model portfolio was up 700 percent.)
In the tradition of the great macro hedge fund investors like George Soros and Julian H. Robertson Jr., Mr. Pal, whose last job was as a portfolio manager at GLG, a hedge fund based in London, likes to pick a theme that may take years to pan out and run with it.
His big bet is that the United States economy is not just about to enter a double-dip recession but that it will be far worse than anything experienced in the lifetime of anyone younger than 70.
He points to a weak rebound in consumer and industrial spending from the 2008 plunge, suggesting that companies and people will remain reluctant to borrow and spend. "Never before have we entered a recession with 10 percent unemployment," he wrote in his August report. "And if you take into account that on average a recession increases unemployment by 3 to 5 percent, we could see 15 percent unemployment in the U.S. -- that is staggering."
As for whether central banks can rescue their economies through a fresh round of money injection, both Mr. Pal and Mr. Edwards are skeptical.
They contend that there is no evidence that the huge injections of liquidity already engineered by the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Bank of England have led to a pickup in demand for loans.
That may be so. But Ed Yardeni, an independent strategist in the United States recognized for his consistently optimistic views, says it would be a mistake to bet against the evidence from strong corporate profits, which he thinks are already driving a global rebound.
"Despite all this negative spin, we have seen one of the best corporate recoveries ever," he said. Executives at large companies "are being fed this same diet of pessimism, but instead of shutting down they are growing their profits and expanding their operations."

Abstract: Among the voting members of the central bank's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee this year, the presidents of the Fed's Boston and St. Louis district banks have warned recently about the threat of deflation, while the Kansas City bank president is known for his view that inflation, the Fed's traditional enemy, remains the greatest threat.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve will meet on Tuesday faced with a pivotal decision about whether to abandon its presumption that the economy is gradually picking up steam and begin to consider new steps to keep the recovery from sputtering out.
A string of developments, including the weak jobs report last Friday, has altered the sentiment within the central bank, leading Fed policy makers to stop worrying for the moment about the increasingly remote prospect of inflation. Instead, they are increasingly focused on the potential for the economy to slip into a deflationary spiral of declining demand, prices and wages.
Economists, including former Fed officials, say the central bank's interest rate policy committee is likely, at the least, to acknowledge the slowdown in the recovery, and to discuss steps like reinvesting the proceeds from its huge mortgage-bond portfolio, which could help the economy by keeping more money in circulation.
Not since 2003 has the prospect of deflation been taken so seriously at the Fed, and not since the 2008 financial crisis have the markets been looking so closely to it for guidance. With Congress unwilling to embark on substantial new stimulus spending, the Fed has the only tools likely to be employed anytime soon in response to the economic warning signs.
The Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, and other officials believe that the Fed, having lowered interest rates all the way to zero in 2008, still has the ability to avoid deflation. But they are also concerned that any new dose of monetary medicine could carry unintended side effects, making it harder to normalize policy in the future.
Complicating matters, a vocal minority of Fed officials is skeptical that deflation -- a spiral of falling wages and prices, which Japan's economy has experienced since the 1990s -- is even a worry.
"The outcome of this meeting is more uncertain than in any in at least the last year," said Laurence H. Meyer, a former Fed governor.
At the Fed's last meeting, in June, the prospect of deflation was discussed for the first time this year.
Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman for 18 years until he retired in 2006, said Friday that the economic outlook had darkened. "It strikes me as a pause in the recovery, but a pause in this type of recovery feels like a quasi-recession," he said.
He added: "At this particular moment, disinflationary pressures are paramount. They will not last indefinitely."
Mr. Greenspan said there had been "some evidence of a pickup in inflation" until the Greek debt crisis took hold in the spring. But the resulting uncertainty drove down long-term interest rates -- the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.82 percent on Friday, the lowest level since April 2009, and barely budged Monday -- in a reflection of what Mr. Greenspan called continuing problems in the financial markets.
Mr. Greenspan declined to make recommendations or predictions for Fed policy, but on Wall Street, there is already talk that the Fed could begin a new round of quantitative easing -- buying financial assets to hold down long-term interest rates and increase the supply of money.
Jan Hatzius, chief United States economist for Goldman Sachs, predicted on Friday that the Fed would begin a new round of asset purchases -- which could include at least $1 trillion worth of Treasury securities -- late this year or early next year. He revised down his forecast for the growth of gross domestic product in 2011 to 1.9 percent from 2.4 percent. He also predicted that unemployment would hit 10 percent in the second quarter of next year.
Among the voting members of the central bank's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee this year, the presidents of the Fed's Boston and St. Louis district banks have warned recently about the threat of deflation, while the Kansas City bank president is known for his view that inflation, the Fed's traditional enemy, remains the greatest threat. But it is Mr. Bernanke who holds the most say over the outcome.
Randall S. Kroszner, a former Fed governor, said the committee was certain to alter its outlook in its statement on Tuesday.
"I think the language will broadly change to acknowledge the moderation in the pace of the recovery," he said.
Mr. Kroszner said it seemed increasingly likely that the Fed could announce that it would reinvest the cash it receives as the mortgage bonds it holds mature, rather than letting its balance sheet gradually shrink over time.
In March, the Fed completed its purchase of $1.25 trillion in mortgage-backed securities. A decision to reinvest the bond proceeds in other mortgage-related securities, or in Treasuries, would be largely symbolic but carry great weight, as it would signal concern about the economy, and also make clear that an "exit strategy" from easy monetary policy was not imminent.
The Fed might also be poised to discuss two other options: lowering the interest rate it pays on the roughly $1 trillion in reserves that banks are keeping at the Fed in excess of what they are required to, and altering the "extended period" language it has been using to describe how long short-term interest rates will remain at "exceptionally low" levels.
Frederic S. Mishkin, another former Fed governor, said that most recoveries hit speed bumps, and that economic indicators contained considerable statistical "noise." He said the Fed would be prudent not to overreact.
"It's not clear the Fed needs to ease at this point," Mr. Mishkin said. "If the recovery gets back on track they are still going to have to worry about an exit strategy. Quantitative easing is not a trivial matter. The expansion of the balance sheet leads to many complications for the Federal Reserve."
But Mr. Meyer, the former Fed govenor, said the committee should take into account not just the probability of various outcomes, but the potential damage associated with each of them.
"Because the cost of a slowdown in growth is so dramatic relative to that of higher inflation, they should follow the risk-management strategy that Greenspan espoused during the last deflation scare," he said.
During that period, in 2002-3, the Fed kept interest rates low, as the economy recovered from the 2001 recession, to guard against deflation. Those fears did not come to pass. But some now say the Fed kept rates too low for too long, feeding the housing bubble.
"It is by no means a slam dunk," Mr. Meyer said of the Fed's decision.

Full text: The lights are going out all over America -- literally. Colorado Springs has made headlines with its desperate attempt to save money by turning off a third of its streetlights, but similar things are either happening or being contemplated across the nation, from Philadelphia to Fresno.
Meanwhile, a country that once amazed the world with its visionary investments in transportation, from the Erie Canal to the Interstate Highway System, is now in the process of unpaving itself: in a number of states, local governments are breaking up roads they can no longer afford to maintain, and returning them to gravel.
And a nation that once prized education -- that was among the first to provide basic schooling to all its children -- is now cutting back. Teachers are being laid off; programs are being canceled; in Hawaii, the school year itself is being drastically shortened. And all signs point to even more cuts ahead.
We're told that we have no choice, that basic government functions -- essential services that have been provided for generations -- are no longer affordable. And it's true that state and local governments, hit hard by the recession, are cash-strapped. But they wouldn't be quite as cash-strapped if their politicians were willing to consider at least some tax increases.
And the federal government, which can sell inflation-protected long-term bonds at an interest rate of only 1.04 percent, isn't cash-strapped at all. It could and should be offering aid to local governments, to protect the future of our infrastructure and our children.
But Washington is providing only a trickle of help, and even that grudgingly. We must place priority on reducing the deficit, say Republicans and "centrist" Democrats. And then, virtually in the next breath, they declare that we must preserve tax cuts for the very affluent, at a budget cost of $700 billion over the next decade.
In effect, a large part of our political class is showing its priorities: given the choice between asking the richest 2 percent or so of Americans to go back to paying the tax rates they paid during the Clinton-era boom, or allowing the nation's foundations to crumble -- literally in the case of roads, figuratively in the case of education -- they're choosing the latter.
It's a disastrous choice in both the short run and the long run.
In the short run, those state and local cutbacks are a major drag on the economy, perpetuating devastatingly high unemployment.
It's crucial to keep state and local government in mind when you hear people ranting about runaway government spending under President Obama. Yes, the federal government is spending more, although not as much as you might think. But state and local governments are cutting back. And if you add them together, it turns out that the only big spending increases have been in safety-net programs like unemployment insurance, which have soared in cost thanks to the severity of the slump.
That is, for all the talk of a failed stimulus, if you look at government spending as a whole you see hardly any stimulus at all. And with federal spending now trailing off, while big state and local cutbacks continue, we're going into reverse.
But isn't keeping taxes for the affluent low also a form of stimulus? Not so you'd notice. When we save a schoolteacher's job, that unambiguously aids employment; when we give millionaires more money instead, there's a good chance that most of that money will just sit idle.
And what about the economy's future? Everything we know about economic growth says that a well-educated population and high-quality infrastructure are crucial. Emerging nations are making huge efforts to upgrade their roads, their ports and their schools. Yet in America we're going backward.
How did we get to this point? It's the logical consequence of three decades of antigovernment rhetoric, rhetoric that has convinced many voters that a dollar collected in taxes is always a dollar wasted, that the public sector can't do anything right.
The antigovernment campaign has always been phrased in terms of opposition to waste and fraud -- to checks sent to welfare queens driving Cadillacs, to vast armies of bureaucrats uselessly pushing paper around. But those were myths, of course; there was never remotely as much waste and fraud as the right claimed. And now that the campaign has reached fruition, we're seeing what was actually in the firing line: services that everyone except the very rich need, services that government must provide or nobody will, like lighted streets, drivable roads and decent schooling for the public as a whole.
So the end result of the long campaign against government is that we've taken a disastrously wrong turn. America is now on the unlit, unpaved road to nowhere.

Abstract: [...] before Japan's on-again, off-again experience with deflation starting in the 1990s, you have to go all the way back to the Great Depression to find another sustained bout of this trend in the developed world. Robert D. Arnott, chairman of the asset management firm Research Affiliates in Newport Beach, Calif., said that while a brief bout of modest deflation was a threat in the short run, inflation -- or rising prices that eat away at consumers' purchasing power -- remained the bigger long-term menace.

Full text: AS chatter has grown about the possibility of a double-dip recession, so, too, have fears about another "D" word: deflation.
Late last month, Jeremy Grantham, the chief investment strategist at GMO, an investment firm based in Boston, issued a warning about deflation after worrying for months that inflationary pressures were brewing. Mr. Grantham told GMO clients recently that as the recovery has slowed, "downward pressure on prices from weak wages and weak demand seems to me now to be much the larger factor."
In doing so, he joined a growing list of prominent analysts -- including William H. Gross, the co-chief investment officer of Pimco -- who've raised concerns that consumption may be postponed and growth thwarted if price declines occur throughout the economy.
Long periods of deflation are quite rare. In fact, before Japan's on-again, off-again experience with deflation starting in the 1990s, you have to go all the way back to the Great Depression to find another sustained bout of this trend in the developed world.
As a result, if deflation were actually to strike in the United States -- and that is a big "if" -- investors might not be able to draw from their own experience to determine how best to position their portfolios.
So what are investors to do?
One textbook strategy is to buy long-term Treasury bonds, which many people already appear to be doing as a hedge against general economic troubles. Yields on 10-year Treasury securities have plunged to 2.8 percent from about 3.8 percent in late April.
In the 1930s, this strategy proved successful in combating deflation, as long-term government bonds generated nominal total returns of nearly 5 percent a year, versus annualized losses of 0.1 percent for equities during that decade, according to Ibbotson Associates.
Strategists who've expressed concerns about deflation aren't necessarily predicting a return to protracted, Depression-era downward price spirals. "We're certainly not positioning for a Japan-like scenario," said Ben Inker, a colleague of Mr. Grantham's who is GMO's head of asset allocation.
Robert D. Arnott, chairman of the asset management firm Research Affiliates in Newport Beach, Calif., said that while a brief bout of modest deflation was a threat in the short run, inflation -- or rising prices that eat away at consumers' purchasing power -- remained the bigger long-term menace.
He said that growing fears over deflation made it more likely that policy makers would overreact in their attempts to stimulate growth in the economy. And that, in turn, means that "inflation is still what you have to worry about down the road," he said.
As a result, Mr. Arnott isn't focusing entirely on near-term deflation. Rather than buying long-term Treasuries, he suggests an investment in Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS.
Mr. Arnott argues that if inflation begins to become a threat two or three years down the road, having the inflationary hedge of a TIPS bond will protect an investor against rising prices -- which is something that a regular Treasury bond won't do.
In the meantime, individual TIPS are still government bonds backed by the full faith and credit of Uncle Sam. And even if Mr. Arnott is wrong and deflation persists for years, investors who buy individual TIPS will at least have the security of being able to recoup the face value of their bond at maturity, while still earning a yield of around 1.2 percent a year.
Now that's 1.6 percentage points less than what regular Treasuries of equivalent maturities are paying. But, Mr. Arnott asks, "What are the chances of inflation being less" than that for a decade?
If you truly fear deflation, fixed-income securities -- because of their relative safety and the income they throw off -- will most likely be better than equities, money managers say. But they note that investors need to be choosy about the types of bonds they buy.
Among corporate securities, investors should pay attention to companies' balance sheets. "You want to avoid highly leveraged companies," said Carl P. Kaufman, manager of the Osterweis Strategic Income fund. In a deflationary environment, a debt-ridden company would have to pay back obligations with increasingly valuable dollars. "In inflation, you're cheapening the value of dollars over time," Mr. Kaufman said. "In deflation, it's the opposite: dollars become dearer over time."
Fixed-income investors may want to focus on high-quality companies that routinely generate tons of cash. The same argument goes for equity investors as well.
Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at Standard & Poor's, says that in deflationary times, some stocks could actually post gains. Throughout the 1990s, when the Japanese stock market began to crater under the weight of deflationary forces, technology, telecommunications and health care shares rose on local markets.
INVESTORS who want to maintain their stock weightings should consider "high-quality, large, blue-chip companies that have balance-sheet strength," said Brian McMahon, chief investment officer at Thornburg Investment Management in Santa Fe, N.M. He said companies like Google and Microsoft often have an added advantage: dominance over their industries, enabling them to maintain their prices even if others in the industry start to lower theirs.
Stocks that pay dividends would also make sense, because the cash thrown off by these shares would be quite valuable in a deflationary environment.
In fact, said Mr. Inker of GMO, if investors really fear deflation, they might consider increasing the cash in their portfolios. "There's a strong case for building up dry powder," he said. "If something bad happens economically -- whether it's deflation or inflation -- that's generally provides a good buying opportunity for investors who have some cash to put to work."

No Wheat Shortage, but Prices May Rise

Abstract: According to Interfax, First Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov said on the Ekho Moskvy radio station, "The decision to ban exports could be adjusted, depending on the harvest."

Full text: The price of wheat had been falling since the last great spike in 2008, but in April, Guy Lapointe seeded 2,200 acres of hard red spring wheat anyway on his rolling land in Alberta.
Now, as prices jump skyward, he is about to send his two John Deere combines into his fields and relishes the higher price he will reap.
"It is looking up," said Mr. Lapointe, 46. "One farmer's misfortune is another's fortune."
The drought afflicting Russia's plains and the Kremlin's sudden decision Thursday to halt exports of wheat will undoubtedly have unexpected consequences across the globe. Farmers from the Midwest to France will fill the void left by Russian exporters, but food processors could get caught by rising costs. The higher prices could be passed to consumers of foods including pizzas, bread and bagels.
If prices rise further, the situation could resemble 2008, when drought in Australia and embargoes across Asia in foodstuffs like rice disrupted the global food supply and prompted some rioting.
But there is an important difference between the current situation and that last price spike: the Russian drought and ban on wheat exports, in contrast to the global shock in 2008 that drove wheat prices up to nearly $13 a bushel and created tensions in Indonesia and Pakistan, are occurring when global wheat production is plentiful and stocks in the United States are at a 23-year high, analysts said.
"This is still going to be the third-largest wheat crop in world history, even with the Russian shortfall," said Daniel W. Basse, president of AgResource, an agricultural consultant firm in Chicago. "The question becomes, Will the drought persist, and will there be problems elsewhere, in other big producers like Argentina or Australia?"
Wheat prices have risen by about 90 percent since June because of the Russian drought and other factors like floods during the planting season in parts of Canada. As the price shock ripples through the supply chain, small food producers may be unprotected because they tend to buy flour on the spot market.
Larger companies, like Piantedosi Baking Company of suburban Boston, have hedged against cost inflation.
"Now that we are hitting the storm here, we are locked down fairly far, to the end of the year practically," said Joseph A. Piantedosi Jr., who runs the company with two cousins.
Papa John's Pizza said it had locked in its wheat purchases through the first quarter of 2011, and Domino's Pizza said it had also hedged.
The drought this summer had already pushed the price of wheat futures to their highest level since 2008. Amid growing nervousness on Monday, the number of wheat futures and options contracts traded on the Chicago Board of Trade reached record highs, beating the previous record set in 2008, and more than double the daily average so far this year.
Then on Thursday, the announcement of the embargo by Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin caused a further sharp swing -- prices hit their upper limits on all three of the exchanges where wheat futures are traded in the United States, in Chicago, Kansas City and Minneapolis.
"It was a really crazy day," said Frank Stone, 55, of the Kansas City Trading Group.
On Friday, the futures prices fell again, this time hitting the lower limits on all three exchanges, on tentative reports that Russia might honor some of its export contracts after all or at least postpone the embargo until after its wheat harvest.
According to Interfax, First Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov said on the Ekho Moskvy radio station, "The decision to ban exports could be adjusted, depending on the harvest."
By close of trading on Friday, wheat futures for September delivery on the Chicago Board of Trade had dropped 60 cents, to $7.25 a bushel, still sharply higher than a few weeks ago.
Cash prices for wheat have risen less significantly than futures prices, traders and analysts said, reflecting the fact that wheat is in healthy supply around the world.
"We do have a lot of wheat in the U.S.," said Erica Olson, marketing specialist at the North Dakota Wheat Commission, a trade group. "We have wheat left over from last year and a good harvest this year."
This is in contrast to the big supply shock in 2007 and 2008. In 2007, for example, worldwide stocks had already fallen sharply. By 2008 they had fallen to the lowest level in 30 years because of falling production and higher consumption, Ms. Olsen said, quoting Department of Agriculture data. Stocks had recovered by May 2010, she said.
Maximo Torero, at the International Food Policy Research Institute, said the market reaction was overdone. Russia represents only 11 percent of the world's wheat exports, he said, and any shortfall could be met by major wheat exporters like the United States, Australia or Canada.
The real concern, he said, was that other countries would follow Russia's lead and stop exporting, a domino reaction around the world similar to the one in 2008 that could cause a sharper increase in prices.
Jack Scoville, vice president of Price Futures Group, a futures brokerage in Chicago, said importers around the world who had agreed to buy wheat from Russia and now faced the prospect of broken contracts would have to look for more expensive supplies elsewhere.
"There will be higher prices for them," he said.

Full text: JAKARTA -- After years of being known for inefficiency, corruption and instability, Indonesia is emerging from the global financial crisis with a surprising new reputation -- economic golden child.
The country's economy, the largest in Southeast Asia, grew at an annual rate of 6.2 percent in the second quarter of this year, data released Thursday showed. That is an acceleration from 2009, when gross domestic product expanded 4.5 percent.
The stock market hit a record high last week and has been among the best-performing equities markets in Asia this year, rising more than 20 percent since Jan. 1. The country's currency, the rupiah, has appreciated nearly 5 percent this year against the dollar, among the strongest showings in Asia besides that of the yen.
Foreign direct investment, which was held in check for years after the 1997 economic crisis in Asia, is also returning. The country had 33.3 trillion rupiah, or $3.7 billion, in foreign direct investment in the second quarter of this year, a 51 percent rise from a year earlier, the Investment Coordinating Board in Indonesia said last week. The country is on track to attract more foreign investment this year than it did in 2008, when it lured in $14.87 billion.
Such statistics have some here cautiously saying that the country, a Muslim-majority democracy and one of the world's most populous countries, could soon merit the kind of attention that investors now lavish on China and India.
"Indonesia is one of the most interesting, most attractive destinations in the world," said Lanang Trihardian, an analyst at Syailendra Capital, a fund management firm based in Jakarta. "Foreign investors have been flowing to Indonesia from maybe around mid-2009. We are seeing a lot of liquidity coming into Indonesia, and it is mostly going to capital markets, to bonds, to stocks."
Undoubtedly, significant obstacles to sustained growth remain. Despite progress on corruption, investors complain of confusing regulations and labor laws that make it difficult to dismiss employees. Little infrastructure has been built since the Asian economic crisis in 1997, and rolling blackouts have plagued the country for years. While the education system has been successful in fulfilling basic requirements like literacy, the universities and colleges in the country are widely considered archaic.
But more than a decade after the chaotic overthrow of the Suharto dictatorship in 1998 -- and subsequent fears of disintegration at the hands of separatist groups, as well as the threat of Islamic militancy -- the country seems to have stabilized. It is rich in natural resources like palm oil, copper and timber, commodities that are in great demand in China.
The administration of President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has won plaudits for reducing debt and has achieved some success fighting graft. Mr. Yudhoyono was resoundingly re-elected to a second five-year term in 2009, and changes aimed at introducing more democracy have seen power devolved to local governments, where elections have been largely peaceful, orderly affairs.
In one sense, Indonesia appears more attractive these days because much of the rest of the global marketplace looks so gloomy. Its low debt, high growth and a sense of optimism compare favorably with a mood of despondency in developed markets like the United States, Japan and Europe.
The huge consumer market in the country, accounting for more than two-thirds of G.D.P., has largely been credited for maintaining growth. Although the global economic crisis crimped confidence, Indonesia's relatively young population of 240 million and government stimulus policies, as well as a popular program of direct cash transfers to the poor, have kept consumption humming.
In Jakarta, worsening traffic and a proliferation of megamalls are seen as signs of the growing strength of the middle class. At the center of the capital, the huge Grand Indonesia mall opened in 2007 and expanded during the global downturn, adding theme areas with mockups of New York, Japan, the Arabian Peninsula and Paris, complete with a miniature, spinning Moulin Rouge windmill.
"We're selling international brands here so Indonesians don't have to shop abroad for them," said Teges Prita Soraya, a spokeswoman for the mall, adding that trade, largely in imported luxury brands, had surged ahead despite the global crisis.
The mall is home to the country's first branch of Harvey Nichols, the upscale British department store, and has boutiques for luxury brands like Chanel, Armani and Dolce & Gabbana -- which already have branches in other malls across the city.
Yet there is criticism that economic growth has had less effect than it should have for the majority. About 15 percent of the population lives below the country's official poverty line of around $1 a day, but advocates for the poor say the percentage would be larger if Indonesia set the bar a little higher, say, at $1.25. Relatively sluggish growth in labor-intensive industries has meant slow progress in curbing unemployment, which is over 7 percent.
The government believes that one solution to moving to a higher level of sustained growth is foreign investment, particularly in industries like manufacturing. The government's investment coordinating board, known as BKPM, is hoping to attract $30 billion to $40 billion in annual foreign investment by 2015 -- three to four times as much as it achieved last year, said Gita Wirjawan, head of the agency.
In an economy currently worth $650 billion a year and expected to grow to $1 trillion in five years, that is not terribly much. But it is "optically" very important for establishing Indonesia as a serious investment destination, he said.
"It's not a slam-dunk, but it's achievable," he said.
Indonesia gets the largest share of its foreign investment from within the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, with non-Asean states like Japan and South Korea, as well as European countries, making up much of the rest.
Indonesia is working to change rules to make it easier to acquire land for infrastructure and is seeing interest in infrastructure investment, Mr. Wirjawan said.
The government recently eased investment rules in areas including health care, construction and electricity generation. At the same time, it is working to put the flow of "hot," or speculative, money to better use, passing rules on government bonds requiring foreign investors to keep their money in the country for longer.
Such efforts seem to be paying off. The government announced this week that China's sovereign fund, China Investment Corp., was hoping to invest $25 billion in infrastructure projects in Indonesia. Posco, the South Korean steel giant, signed a $6 billion deal on Wednesday to build a plant in Indonesia with the local producer Krakatau Steel.
While investment in manufacturing still lags behind other sectors, Mr. Wirjawan said that Indonesia, with its relatively low labor costs, was reaping the benefits of rising costs in regional competitors.
"We're seeing an increasing relocation of factories by the Taiwanese, the Koreans and Japanese from Vietnam and China, given their rising labor costs and given the increased stability that people are seeing in Indonesia from an economic and political standpoint," he said.
The Indonesian Footwear Association has said that major brands including Asics, Mizuno and New Balance have shifted part of their production to Indonesia this year because of rising costs elsewhere. Indonesia's footwear industry employs 640,000 people and exported $1.8 billion worth of goods in 2009, said the association's chairman, Eddy Widjanarko. Producers are hoping to increase that figure to $2 billion this year.
Katja Schreiber, a spokeswoman for Adidas -- which has also been aggressively expanding production in Indonesia -- said the country, its third-biggest supplier, offered "abundant labor availability, good quality, competitive prices and political stability." Although production here is growing rapidly, she said, it is not happening at the expense of its top suppliers, China and Vietnam.
The local stock market has reflected the perceived strengths of the economy. Shares related to commodities, Indonesia's main export sector, have been strong earners. Banking stocks have risen along with the generally upbeat mood on consumption and the relatively good health of the sector, which, for the most part, weathered the credit crisis reasonably well. Major consumer shares like Unilever Indonesia and the car distributor Astra International have been consistent leaders on the local index.
All this exuberance has raised some fears that inflation could become a big problem. The country's central bank, Bank Indonesia, decided to hold its benchmark interest rate at 6.5 percent this week, despite a jump in annual inflation to 6.22 percent in July.
Regardless, many feel that Indonesia's time has come again.
"In Asia there is a feeling that after you invest in China and after you invest in India, where are you going to invest? said Fauzi Ichsan, senior economist for Standard Chartered in Indonesia.
"It'll have to be Indonesia. It's a natural destination."

Abstract: The split between the chief economists, whose work helps inform trading strategies recommended to investors by their firms, echoes a broader and sometimes fiercer debate among academic economists and commentators about the threat posed by deflation and what the government's response should be. According to the deflationistas, as they are nicknamed, a new round of stimulus spending by Washington is urgently required to stave off a Depression-like cycle of falling prices and wages that is difficult to reverse once it is set in motion.

Full text: When the latest unemployment figures are announced on Friday, all of Wall Street will be watching. But for Richard Berner of Morgan Stanley and Jan Hatzius of Goldman Sachs, the results will be more than just another marker in an avalanche of data.
Instead, the numbers will be a clue as to which of the two economists is right about where the American economy is headed. Their sharp disagreement over that question adds yet another twist to the fierce rivalry between the firms, Wall Street's version of the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox.
Mr. Hatzius is arguably Wall Street's most prominent pessimist. He warns that the American economy is poised for a sharp slowdown in the second half of the year. That would send unemployment higher again and raise the risk of deflation. A rare occurrence, deflation can have a devastating effect on a struggling economy as prices and wages fall. He says he may be compelled to downgrade his already anemic growth predictions for the economy.
For months, Mr. Berner has been sticking to a more optimistic forecast, despite growing evidence in favor of Mr. Hatzius's view. Last week, Mr. Berner was caught by surprise when the federal government reported that the economy grew at a 2..4 percent pace in the second quarter, well below the 3.8 percent he had forecast a month before. Mr. Hatzius came closer to hitting the mark, having projected a 2 percent growth rate.
Mr. Berner and his deputy, David Greenlaw, still expect a pickup in the second half of the year, which would help gradually bring down unemployment. They play down the danger posed by deflation, the malady that deepened the Great Depression and contributed to Japan's lost decade of the 1990s.
"I'd say at this point the data and the sentiment in the marketplace have certainly gone more Jan's way than mine," Mr. Berner said. Some people, he added, "think I'm out of my mind. But I have a conviction in my beliefs that's based on my analysis."
Mr. Hatzius, a 41-year-old native of Germany who was 3 when Mr. Berner started out as an economist, is more restrained. He can afford to be, having snagged the top spot in a recent ranking of Wall Street economists as well as an award from Arizona State University honoring his "uncanny economic forecasting that anticipated the global financial crisis."
On Wall Street, both men were among a very small group that accurately predicted the recent recession. Mr. Berner's long resume includes stints at the Federal Reserve in Washington and Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh. "I've seen plenty of ups and downs," said Mr. Berner, 64, sitting in a corner office overlooking the Manhattan skyline at Morgan Stanley's Midtown headquarters.
Showing not even a hint of doubt, Mr. Hatzius said, "The prospect of substantial inflation seems very remote, but the prospect for deflation is far from remote. A double dip is certainly possible but not likely."
Mr. Berner does not expect substantial inflation, but he is predicting inflation will run 1 to 2 percent annually rather than the near-zero level Mr. Hatzius sees by the end of next year.
"There is still a one in 10 chance of deflation," Mr. Berner calculates. "But we already have been much more aggressive and proactive in dealing with the problem than Japan was," he said, referring to the Federal Reserve's decision to quickly cut rates and aggressively buy government securities.
The split between the chief economists, whose work helps inform trading strategies recommended to investors by their firms, echoes a broader and sometimes fiercer debate among academic economists and commentators about the threat posed by deflation and what the government's response should be.
According to the deflationistas, as they are nicknamed, a new round of stimulus spending by Washington is urgently required to stave off a Depression-like cycle of falling prices and wages that is difficult to reverse once it is set in motion.
Inflationistas, by contrast, worry more about the effect that additional government borrowing could have on the recovery. With the budget deficit expected to hover around $1 trillion a year for the next decade, they say, interest rates could eventually surge, making borrowing -- and goods -- more expensive. A double dip, they say, is highly unlikely.
Mr. Hatzius's gloomy outlook is owed centrally to Americans' slowdown in spending. Recent data suggest that consumers are using any extra cash they have to pay down debt or put into savings. That places a strain on an American economy that has become hugely dependent on consumer spending.
On Tuesday, the Commerce Department reported that Americans saved 6.4 percent of their after-tax income in June, in contrast to the years before the recession, when savings rates stood at 1 to 2 percent.
Last month, the Federal Reserve reported that consumer debt dropped by 4.5 percent in May, a $9 billion decline. It was the 20th consecutive month that figure has dropped. In 2007, consumer debt jumped by 5.7 percent, or nearly $40 billion.
"We had a housing and credit boom that was unsustainable, and now this boom has turned into a bust," Mr. Hatzius said. "There was too much debt, and the deleveraging process has still got a ways to go. It's going to keep private demand weak."
Another big factor is the amount of slack in the economy. According to a recent report by Nomura, "The U.S. economy continues to operate with a staggering amount of spare capacity -- unemployed workers, idle trucks and factories, etc."
Mr. Hatzius agrees, adding that all this extra capacity will restrict the ability of companies to raise prices, thus raising the risk of deflation. "It's plain to see there's a ton of slack in the economy," he said. "We're not managing to generate enough demand to absorb all these productive resources in the economy."
Mr. Berner is also studying the role that slack and deleveraging are playing, but he draws very different conclusions from Mr. Hatzius. Excess capacity is being reduced more quickly than Mr. Hatzius believes, Mr. Berner said. That will help businesses raise prices and improve profits, thus heading off the threat of deflation.
What is more, Mr. Berner argues that the deleveraging process is much further along than Mr. Hatzius contends, which will encourage consumers to start spending again. He expects economic growth in the second half of 2010 to run at more than 3 percent, roughly twice the 1.5 percent rate Mr. Hatzius projects.
If Mr. Hatzius is right, unemployment will still stand at 9.7 percent at the end of next year, slightly higher than it is now. Mr. Berner says he believes unemployment should sink to 8.7 percent by then. As for Friday's numbers, Mr. Berner is calling for a private sector gain of 145,000 jobs versus Mr. Hatzius's prediction of 75,000 new jobs.
Either way, both predict unemployment will remain at uncomfortably high levels for several years.
One answer, Mr. Hatzius says, is another round of stimulus spending by Washington to fend off the deflation risk he worries about.
Mr. Berner was skeptical of the stimulus bill passed in 2009, and he still "doubts that traditional fiscal stimulus is the right tool for the job."
Instead, he and his colleague Mr. Greenlaw argue for new mortgage rules that would reduce foreclosures and steady the housing market, payroll tax credits to encourage hiring and a new job training corps for unemployed workers.
"Friday's number is just one tile in a mosaic," Mr. Berner said. "From time to time, it'll be like I'm winning, from time to time Jan will be winning."
"The truth is that it's just a crummy moderate recovery," Mr. Berner added, hedging his bets. "We'll both testify to that."

Abstract: The president of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, offered a somewhat more optimistic assessment of the euro zone economy Thursday and said that bank stress tests in July were "an important step forward in restoring market confidence." The housing market, which had benefited from low interest rates and a relatively low pound that had attracted foreign buyers, started to show some signs of weakening in June as more homes came up for sale, according to the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.

Full text: FRANKFURT -- The president of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, offered a somewhat more optimistic assessment of the euro zone economy Thursday and said that bank stress tests in July were "an important step forward in restoring market confidence."
Mr. Trichet made the comments after the European Central Bank, like the Bank of England earlier in the day, left its benchmark interest rate at a record low.
He said that he was not signaling plans by the European Central Bank to raise rates, and cautioned that growth was occurring in "an environment of uncertainty."
In previous months Mr. Trichet had used the phrase "high uncertainty." The subtle shift comes after recent data, particularly from Germany, showed the European economy performing better than expected.
"Essentially these are only shifts in emphasis," Jorg Kramer, chief economist at Commerzbank, said in a note. "We see no reason to change our forecast that the E.C.B. will not raise its key rate before the end of next year."
German industrial orders rose 3.2 percent in June, according to figures released Thursday, though Commerzbank analysts pointed out that the increase was solely because of a large order to Airbus, the aircraft manufacturer.
Mr. Trichet said there were still many economic risks, like renewed tensions in financial markets. "I don't declare victory," he told reporters at a news conference after a regular monthly meeting of the bank's governing council. "We remain cautious."
The European bank left its main interest rate at 1 percent. Earlier the British central bank kept its rate at 0.5 percent, reflecting concerns that Britain's recovery is still fragile, but voted against expanding a stimulus package.
In Britain, the economy had shown encouraging signs over the last four months, with growth across most industries, including in construction and manufacturing. But some economists warned that headwinds remained, including more than two million people out of work, a lack of bank lending and government plans for steep spending cuts. Slower growth in the 16 countries that share the euro and in China could further dampen Britain's economic recovery, they said.
"The economic recovery is still subpar and will continue to be so for some time," said Brian Hilliard, an economist at Societe Generale in London. The Bank of England will probably stick to its rates for a while, he said, but "there is a lot of turmoil underneath."
Britain's gross domestic product rose 1.1 percent in the second quarter, the fastest pace in four years, but some economists doubted that pace would continue. The housing market, which had benefited from low interest rates and a relatively low pound that had attracted foreign buyers, started to show some signs of weakening in June as more homes came up for sale, according to the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.
The pound ended a nine-day increase against the dollar on Wednesday, the longest gain in more than 18 years.
One of Britain's largest clothing retailers confirmed concerns about consumer spending on Wednesday when the company said there was a "noticeable cooling" in demand recently. Planned government cuts of some benefits to the poorest would reduce consumers' appetite to spend, it said.
The economic recovery has gained strength recently in the euro region, mainly helped by stronger exports, even as peripheral countries like Greece continue to suffer under a huge debt burden. Suez Environnement, the large French water company, raised its sales targets for this year on Wednesday after more than doubling its first-half profit. In Germany, Bayerische Motoren Werke, the maker of BMW automobiles, also reported higher profit on growing demand from the United States and China.
Britain's Monetary Policy Committee, which decides on interest rates, had considered expanding its $:200 billion, or $318 billion, economic stimulus last month, after the economy showed signs of weakening again.
A former deputy governor of the Bank of England, John Gieve, said on Tuesday, however, that policy makers should not loosen monetary policy further at this point because he believed the economy was strengthening. He also said he expected the central bank to keep rates unchanged through the autumn before raising them at a faster pace than some economists expect.
The European Central Bank's benchmark rate has been at a record low for 15 months.
Marie Diron, economic adviser to Ernst & Young, the consulting firm, said that even if official rates were not likely to change "monetary policy is currently being tightened by stealth" because market interest rates were rising. "The E.C.B. should make sure that monetary policy remains as expansionary as possible until the recovery takes hold," she said in a note.
Though Germany has been growing more strongly than expected, and profits have recovered at many European banks, countries like Spain and Greece face a long struggle to become competitive in world markets and reduce unemployment.
The central bank is unlikely to raise interest rates until growth is more solid, provided inflation remains below the official target of 2 percent.
In addition, businesses in many countries are still having trouble getting credit, according to bank data released last week. Bank lending is one of the main barometers the bank uses to set monetary policy.
Mr. Trichet suggested on Thursday that the data might provide an overly pessimistic picture of lending, because it was compiled from mid-June to mid-July when confidence in financial markets was lower than it is now.
Since the financial crisis exploded, the European Central Bank has been providing banks with almost unlimited loans at 1 percent interest. If the stress tests prove successful in easing doubts about the health of euro zone banks, the bank should be able to withdraw the extraordinary measures and bring the banking system back to normal.
Already the bank has almost completely wound down its controversial purchases of European government bonds, which it began in May to prevent a debt-market collapse that could have caused a wider crisis.
Though widely criticized as too lax, the stress tests of 91 banks provided investors and analysts with better information about institutions' holdings of Greek bonds and other devalued paper. In Spain, the stress tests have provided extra impetus for the troubled savings banks known as cajas to merge and raise capital.
"The results confirm the resilience of European Union and euro area banking systems as a whole to severe economic and financial shocks," Mr. Trichet said.
But questions remain about other banks, like Germany's public sector landesbanks, which could continue to make institutions mistrustful of each others' creditworthiness and prevent interbank lending from returning to normal.
While praising the stress tests, Mr. Trichet also repeated calls for institutions' to use "all possible means" to strengthen their financial foundations by, for example, raising more capital from investors or taking fuller advantage of government aid.

Full text: Stocks fell on Tuesday, pulling the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index down from a 10-week high, as weaker-than-estimated data on home sales, factory orders and consumer spending cast doubt on the economic recovery.
Procter & Gamble slid 3.4 percent. Dow Chemical dropped 10 percent after its earnings missed estimates. Losses were limited as Pfizer rose 5.6 percent to lead a rally in health companies after its earnings beat estimates. Energy shares gained as oil rose $1.21 to settle at $82.55 a barrel.
After two days of gains, the S.& P. 500 slipped 5.40 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,120.46. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 38 points, or 0.4 percent, to close at 10,636.38. The Nasdaq composite index lost 11.84 points, or 0.5 percent, finishing at 2,283.52.
"There's a lot of uncertainty on the part of investors because they see economic reports coming in a bit weaker than earlier this year," said Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist at Banyan Partners in New York. "We're still on a path to recovery, but it's going to be a very slow-growth recovery."
Benchmark indexes opened lower after Commerce Department data showed that consumer spending and personal incomes in the United States were unexpectedly unchanged in June, signaling that a lack of jobs was hurting the biggest part of the economy.
Stocks extended losses after the National Association of Realtors' index of pending home resales dropped 2.6 percent from the previous month. Economists projected a 4 percent gain, according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey. The Commerce Department said orders placed with factories declined 1.2 percent in June. A survey of economists projected a 0.5 percent decline.
"A flat to sluggish economy is what we are seeing," said Barry R. James, president of James Investment Research in Alpha, Ohio. "The consumer is pulling back." Mr. James expects "another wash-out in stock prices," probably before the end of the year.
Federal Reserve policy makers have signaled that they probably will not provide more stimulus at their Aug. 10 meeting and will wait to see if signs of weaker economic growth persist. The Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, told lawmakers in South Carolina on Monday that consumer spending was "likely to pick up" amid a moderate expansion.
Procter & Gamble dropped $2.12, to $59.94 after reporting fiscal fourth-quarter profit of 71 cents a share, trailing the average analyst estimate of 73 cents in a Bloomberg survey. Profit excluding some items will be as much as $1.01 a share in the first quarter, the company forecast, compared with the $1.05 average analyst estimate.
Dow Chemical dropped $2.83 to finish at $25.50. Second-quarter net income was $651 million, or 50 cents a share, in contrast to a net loss of $344 million, or 47 cents, a year earlier, Dow said. Profit excluding some items was 54 cents, compared with the 57-cent average estimate of analysts in a Bloomberg survey.
Home Depot retreated 67 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $28.45, and the home builder the Pulte Group fell 55 cents, or 6.1 percent, to $8.43. A gauge of home builders across S.& P. indexes tumbled 3.7 percent.
"Today Dow is a disappointment, and Procter & Gamble, but on the whole you have to be very encouraged," said Henry B. Smith, chief investment officer at Haverford Trust in Radnor, Pa. "When you factor in valuations down in the 12-to-13-times range in a low-inflation, low-interest-rate environment, it makes equities look very attractive."
Pfizer climbed 86 cents, to close at $16.34. It reported second-quarter adjusted earnings of 62 cents a share. The average analyst estimate in a Bloomberg survey was 52 cents a share.
The 10-year Treasury note rose 15/32 to 105. The yield fell to 2.91, from 2.96 late Monday.

More Workers Face Pay Cuts, Not Furloughs

Abstract: Mr. Chaison says the latest wave of private-sector pay cuts is reminiscent of those in the early 1980s, when many companies -- especially those with unionized work forces -- cut wages in response to a recession, intensified competition from imports and new low-cost competitors spawned by government-backed deregulation.

Full text: The furloughs that popped up during the recession are being replaced by a highly unusual tactic: actual cuts in pay.
Local and state governments, as well as some companies, are squeezing their employees to work the same amount for less money in cost-saving measures that are often described as a last-ditch effort to avoid layoffs.
A new report on Tuesday showed a slight dip in overall wages and salaries in June, caused partly by employees working fewer hours.
Though average hourly pay is still higher than when the recession began, the new wage rollbacks feed worries that the economy has weakened and could even be at risk of deflation. That is when the prices of goods and assets fall and people withhold spending as they wait for prices to drop further, a familiar idea to those following the recent housing market.
A period of such slack economic demand produced a lost decade in Japan, and while it is still seen as unlikely here, some policy-making officials at the Federal Reserve recently voiced concern about the possibility because the consequences could be so dire.
Pay cuts are appearing most frequently among state and local governments, which are under extraordinary budget pressures and have often already tried furloughs, i.e., docking pay in exchange for time off. Warning that they will have to lay off people otherwise, many governors and mayors are pressing public employee unions to accept a reduction in salary of a few percentage points, without getting days off in exchange.
At the University of Hawaii, professors have accepted a 6.7 percent cut. Albuquerque has trimmed pay for its 6,000 employees by 1.8 percent on average, and New York's governor, David A. Paterson, has sought a 4 percent wage rollback for most state employees. State troopers in Vermont agreed to a 3 percent cut. In California, teachers in the Capistrano and Pacheco school districts have accepted salary cuts.
"We've seen pay freezes before in the public sector, but pay cuts are something very new to that sector," said Gary N. Chaison, an industrial relations professor at Clark University. Outsize pension costs and balanced budget requirements are squeezing many states as tax revenue has come up short.
It is impossible to say how many employers have cut workers' pay, because the government does not keep such statistics. Economists say a modest but growing number of employers have ordered wage cuts, especially in the public sector. In a 2010 survey by the National League of Cities, 51 percent of the cities that responded said they had either cut or frozen salaries of city employees, 22 percent said they had revised union contracts to reduce some pay and benefits, and 19 percent said they had instituted furloughs.
Some businesses are also cutting workers' pay, often to help stay afloat or to eliminate their losses, although a few have seized on the slack labor market and workers' weak bargaining power to cut pay and thereby increase their profits and competitiveness.
Economists note that wages continued to increase in 2008 after the recession began, even adjusted for inflation. But those wages have been flat for the last 18 months, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Mr. Chaison says the latest wave of private-sector pay cuts is reminiscent of those in the early 1980s, when many companies -- especially those with unionized work forces -- cut wages in response to a recession, intensified competition from imports and new low-cost competitors spawned by government-backed deregulation. Now, as then, companies frequently say that compensation for unionized workers, in both wages and benefits, is out of line. For instance, the Westin Hotel in Providence, R.I., after failing to reach a new contract with its main union, has sliced wages 20 percent, saying its previous pay levels were not competitive with those at the city's many nonunion hotels.
Factory owners sometimes warn that they will close or move jobs to lower-cost locales unless workers agree to a pay cut. In its most recent union contract, General Motors is paying new employees $14 an hour, half the rate it pays its long-term workers.
Sub-Zero, which makes refrigerators, freezers and ovens, warned its workers last month that it might close one or more factories in Wisconsin and lay off 500 employees unless they accepted a 20 percent cut in wages and benefits. Management warned that it might transfer those operations to Kentucky or Arizona, saying it needed lower costs because sales were weaker than hoped.
The pain is felt across industries. At the Seattle Symphony, musicians have taken a 5 percent pay cut, while ABF Freight System, a major trucking company, has asked the Teamsters to agree to 15 percent less. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch has lowered pay 6 percent, while Newsday has gotten its staff to accept a 5 to 10 percent pay cut.
While most of the pay cuts seem to hit unionized workers, David Lewin, a professor of management at the University of California, Los Angeles, who has written extensively on employee compensation, says some cuts are also quietly taking place among nonunion employers.
Reed Smith, a firm with 1,500 lawyers, has cut salaries for first-year associates in major cities to $130,000 from $160,000. Warren Hospital, a nonunionized facility in Phillipsburg, N.J., ordered pay cuts of 2 to 4 percent because lower Medicaid reimbursements had squeezed the hospital's finances.
Fast-rising pension and health costs are making benefit costs grow more rapidly than wages, some employers say, and cutting wages is often easier than other ways to pare labor costs. But some workers say these cuts are unfair at a time when corporate profits and employee productivity have risen strongly.
Sometimes unions and their workers cooperate with management on pay cuts, hoping to recoup some wage increases when conditions improve. In Madawaska, Me., 460 unionized workers accepted an 8.5 percent wage cut in May to help keep their paper mill in business.
"Workers, of course, do not like to have their pay cut, but I think that workers' major concern now is, 'Do I have a job?' " Professor Lewin said. "If the unemployment rate were lower, we'd see a lot more resentment toward pay cuts."
But workers sometimes fight back -- particularly if an employer doesn't show signs of distress.
In Albuquerque, where the mayor pushed through pay cuts to bridge a $66 million budget deficit, the largest union of municipal workers is suing, arguing that the mayor's plan should include furloughs.
The mayor, Richard J. Berry, rejected that idea. "You want to keep people employed. You want to preserve public services. And you don't want to raise taxes," he said. "When you're trying to lower the cost of government while maintaining services, furloughs don't do the trick."
Albuquerque would have to trim at least 100 jobs without the cuts, he said, which top out at 3.5 percent for employees earning more than $90,000. Those earning under $30,000 will not be affected.
At the Mott's apple juice and sauce plant in Williamson, N.Y., 30 miles east of Rochester, 300 unionized workers have been on strike since May 23 over management's demands for a $1.50-an-hour wage cut, a reduction in company 401(k) contributions and higher employee contributions to health insurance. The strikers are seething over management's demands because the plant has been profitable and Mott's corporate parent, the Dr Pepper Snapple Group, reported record profits last year.
"They keep piling more and more work on us, but they want to pay us less and less," said Michele Morgan, a Mott's employee. "It's a slap in the face."
Chris Barnes, a company spokesman, said the Mott's employees were overpaid, at $21 an hour, given that the average in the area for food manufacturing workers was $14 an hour. The union disputes those figures.
"Our only objective," Mr. Barnes said, "was to continue to enhance the competitiveness and flexibility of our operations."

Abstract: [...] we see Congress sitting on its hands, with Republicans and conservative Democrats refusing to spend anything to create jobs, and unwilling even to mitigate the suffering of the jobless. The Fed, after all, is supposed to pursue two goals: full employment and price stability, usually defined in practice as an inflation rate of about 2 percent. Since unemployment is very high and inflation well below target, you might expect the Fed to be taking aggressive action to boost the economy.

Full text: I'm starting to have a sick feeling about prospects for American workers -- but not, or not entirely, for the reasons you might think.
Yes, growth is slowing, and the odds are that unemployment will rise, not fall, in the months ahead. That's bad. But what's worse is the growing evidence that our governing elite just doesn't care -- that a once-unthinkable level of economic distress is in the process of becoming the new normal.
And I worry that those in power, rather than taking responsibility for job creation, will soon declare that high unemployment is "structural," a permanent part of the economic landscape -- and that by condemning large numbers of Americans to long-term joblessness, they'll turn that excuse into dismal reality.
Not long ago, anyone predicting that one in six American workers would soon be unemployed or underemployed, and that the average unemployed worker would have been jobless for 35 weeks, would have been dismissed as outlandishly pessimistic -- in part because if anything like that happened, policy makers would surely be pulling out all the stops on behalf of job creation.
But now it has happened, and what do we see?
First, we see Congress sitting on its hands, with Republicans and conservative Democrats refusing to spend anything to create jobs, and unwilling even to mitigate the suffering of the jobless.
We're told that we can't afford to help the unemployed -- that we must get budget deficits down immediately or the "bond vigilantes" will send U.S. borrowing costs sky-high. Some of us have tried to point out that those bond vigilantes are, as far as anyone can tell, figments of the deficit hawks' imagination -- far from fleeing U.S. debt, investors have been buying it eagerly, driving interest rates to historic lows. But the fearmongers are unmoved: fighting deficits, they insist, must take priority over everything else -- everything else, that is, except tax cuts for the rich, which must be extended, no matter how much red ink they create.
The point is that a large part of Congress -- large enough to block any action on jobs -- cares a lot about taxes on the richest 1 percent of the population, but very little about the plight of Americans who can't find work.
Well, if Congress won't act, what about the Federal Reserve? The Fed, after all, is supposed to pursue two goals: full employment and price stability, usually defined in practice as an inflation rate of about 2 percent. Since unemployment is very high and inflation well below target, you might expect the Fed to be taking aggressive action to boost the economy. But it isn't.
It's true that the Fed has already pushed one pedal to the metal: short-term interest rates, its usual policy tool, are near zero. Still, Ben Bernanke, the Fed chairman, has assured us that he has other options, like holding more mortgage-backed securities and promising to keep short-term rates low. And a large body of research suggests that the Fed could boost the economy by committing to an inflation target higher than 2 percent.
But the Fed hasn't done any of these things. Instead, some officials are defining success down.
For example, last week Richard Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, argued that the Fed bears no responsibility for the economy's weakness, which he attributed to business uncertainty about future regulations -- a view that's popular in conservative circles, but completely at odds with all the actual evidence. In effect, he responded to the Fed's failure to achieve one of its two main goals by taking down the goalpost.
He then moved the other goalpost, defining the Fed's aim not as roughly 2 percent inflation, but rather as that of "keeping inflation extremely low and stable."
In short, it's all good. And I predict -- having seen this movie before, in Japan -- that if and when prices start falling, when below-target inflation becomes deflation, some Fed officials will explain that that's O.K., too.
What lies down this path? Here's what I consider all too likely: Two years from now unemployment will still be extremely high, quite possibly higher than it is now. But instead of taking responsibility for fixing the situation, politicians and Fed officials alike will declare that high unemployment is structural, beyond their control. And as I said, over time these excuses may turn into a self-fulfilling prophecy, as the long-term unemployed lose their skills and their connections with the work force, and become unemployable.
I'd like to imagine that public outrage will prevent this outcome. But while Americans are indeed angry, their anger is unfocused. And so I worry that our governing elite, which just isn't all that into the unemployed, will allow the jobs slump to go on and on and on.

Full text: IF there were such a thing as Chapter 11 for politicians, the Republican push to extend the unaffordable Bush tax cuts would amount to a bankruptcy filing. The nation's public debt -- if honestly reckoned to include municipal bonds and the $7 trillion of new deficits baked into the cake through 2015 -- will soon reach $18 trillion. That's a Greece-scale 120 percent of gross domestic product, and fairly screams out for austerity and sacrifice. It is therefore unseemly for the Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, to insist that the nation's wealthiest taxpayers be spared even a three-percentage-point rate increase.
More fundamentally, Mr. McConnell's stand puts the lie to the Republican pretense that its new monetarist and supply-side doctrines are rooted in its traditional financial philosophy. Republicans used to believe that prosperity depended upon the regular balancing of accounts -- in government, in international trade, on the ledgers of central banks and in the financial affairs of private households and businesses, too. But the new catechism, as practiced by Republican policymakers for decades now, has amounted to little more than money printing and deficit finance -- vulgar Keynesianism robed in the ideological vestments of the prosperous classes.
This approach has not simply made a mockery of traditional party ideals. It has also led to the serial financial bubbles and Wall Street depredations that have crippled our economy. More specifically, the new policy doctrines have caused four great deformations of the national economy, and modern Republicans have turned a blind eye to each one.
The first of these started when the Nixon administration defaulted on American obligations under the 1944 Bretton Woods agreement to balance our accounts with the world. Now, since we have lived beyond our means as a nation for nearly 40 years, our cumulative current-account deficit -- the combined shortfall on our trade in goods, services and income -- has reached nearly $8 trillion. That's borrowed prosperity on an epic scale.
It is also an outcome that Milton Friedman said could never happen when, in 1971, he persuaded President Nixon to unleash on the world paper dollars no longer redeemable in gold or other fixed monetary reserves. Just let the free market set currency exchange rates, he said, and trade deficits will self-correct.
It may be true that governments, because they intervene in foreign exchange markets, have never completely allowed their currencies to float freely. But that does not absolve Friedman's $8 trillion error. Once relieved of the discipline of defending a fixed value for their currencies, politicians the world over were free to cheapen their money and disregard their neighbors.
In fact, since chronic current-account deficits result from a nation spending more than it earns, stringent domestic belt-tightening is the only cure. When the dollar was tied to fixed exchange rates, politicians were willing to administer the needed castor oil, because the alternative was to make up for the trade shortfall by paying out reserves, and this would cause immediate economic pain -- from high interest rates, for example. But now there is no discipline, only global monetary chaos as foreign central banks run their own printing presses at ever faster speeds to sop up the tidal wave of dollars coming from the Federal Reserve.
The second unhappy change in the American economy has been the extraordinary growth of our public debt. In 1970 it was just 40 percent of gross domestic product, or about $425 billion. When it reaches $18 trillion, it will be 40 times greater than in 1970. This debt explosion has resulted not from big spending by the Democrats, but instead the Republican Party's embrace, about three decades ago, of the insidious doctrine that deficits don't matter if they result from tax cuts.
In 1981, traditional Republicans supported tax cuts, matched by spending cuts, to offset the way inflation was pushing many taxpayers into higher brackets and to spur investment. The Reagan administration's hastily prepared fiscal blueprint, however, was no match for the primordial forces -- the welfare state and the warfare state -- that drive the federal spending machine.
Soon, the neocons were pushing the military budget skyward. And the Republicans on Capitol Hill who were supposed to cut spending exempted from the knife most of the domestic budget -- entitlements, farm subsidies, education, water projects. But in the end it was a new cadre of ideological tax-cutters who killed the Republicans' fiscal religion.
Through the 1984 election, the old guard earnestly tried to control the deficit, rolling back about 40 percent of the original Reagan tax cuts. But when, in the following years, the Federal Reserve chairman, Paul Volcker, finally crushed inflation, enabling a solid economic rebound, the new tax-cutters not only claimed victory for their supply-side strategy but hooked Republicans for good on the delusion that the economy will outgrow the deficit if plied with enough tax cuts.
By fiscal year 2009, the tax-cutters had reduced federal revenues to 15 percent of gross domestic product, lower than they had been since the 1940s. Then, after rarely vetoing a budget bill and engaging in two unfinanced foreign military adventures, George W. Bush surrendered on domestic spending cuts, too -- signing into law $420 billion in non-defense appropriations, a 65 percent gain from the $260 billion he had inherited eight years earlier. Republicans thus joined the Democrats in a shameless embrace of a free-lunch fiscal policy.
The third ominous change in the American economy has been the vast, unproductive expansion of our financial sector. Here, Republicans have been oblivious to the grave danger of flooding financial markets with freely printed money and, at the same time, removing traditional restrictions on leverage and speculation. As a result, the combined assets of conventional banks and the so-called shadow banking system (including investment banks and finance companies) grew from a mere $500 billion in 1970 to $30 trillion by September 2008.
But the trillion-dollar conglomerates that inhabit this new financial world are not free enterprises. They are rather wards of the state, extracting billions from the economy with a lot of pointless speculation in stocks, bonds, commodities and derivatives. They could never have survived, much less thrived, if their deposits had not been government-guaranteed and if they hadn't been able to obtain virtually free money from the Fed's discount window to cover their bad bets.
The fourth destructive change has been the hollowing out of the larger American economy. Having lived beyond our means for decades by borrowing heavily from abroad, we have steadily sent jobs and production offshore. In the past decade, the number of high-value jobs in goods production and in service categories like trade, transportation, information technology and the professions has shrunk by 12 percent, to 68 million from 77 million. The only reason we have not experienced a severe reduction in nonfarm payrolls since 2000 is that there has been a gain in low-paying, often part-time positions in places like bars, hotels and nursing homes.
It is not surprising, then, that during the last bubble (from 2002 to 2006) the top 1 percent of Americans -- paid mainly from the Wall Street casino -- received two-thirds of the gain in national income, while the bottom 90 percent -- mainly dependent on Main Street's shrinking economy -- got only 12 percent. This growing wealth gap is not the market's fault. It's the decaying fruit of bad economic policy.
The day of national reckoning has arrived. We will not have a conventional business recovery now, but rather a long hangover of debt liquidation and downsizing -- as suggested by last week's news that the national economy grew at an anemic annual rate of 2.4 percent in the second quarter. Under these circumstances, it's a pity that the modern Republican Party offers the American people an irrelevant platform of recycled Keynesianism when the old approach -- balanced budgets, sound money and financial discipline -- is needed more than ever.

Full text: If you are worried about the future of Social Security, join the crowd.
With the nation's debt swelling, the pressure on Washington to cut spending will only rise. Social Security may not be the first place lawmakers look. But the program, which has provided a significant financial cushion for retirees and others since the first checks were mailed in 1937, will surely be part of the discussion.
The program, which has its own dedicated stream of income, is projected to pay out more this year than it is taking in, but that is a function of the weak economy. Social Security will, according to the last annual report from its trustees, be able to pay full benefits through 2037. Then, if there are no changes in the program in the meantime, the taxes collected will be enough to pay out only about 75 percent of benefits through 2083.
So while Social Security's finances are stable in the short term, most experts agree that the program needs to be bolstered for the long term. Among the proposals circulating is one from Representative John Boehner of Ohio, the House Republican leader, who recently suggested raising the retirement age to 70 for people at least 20 years from retirement.
Other options include increasing Social Security payroll taxes, subjecting more income to the tax, reducing initial benefit payments or cutting cost-of-living increases (which would affect current retirees).
But even if it's not clear yet what, if anything, will be done to Social Security and when, we thought it would be useful to look at a worst-case possibility -- to assume that benefits will not continue to be as generous. This is especially important as pensions continue to fade away.
So what are the financial implications of pushing back the full retirement age? What happens if the government reduces benefits for future retirees? What will that mean to people in the middle of their careers, beyond the rote response that they're going to have to work longer and save more?
Yes, it means fewer dinners out and driving a more economical car. But it also may mean that people in their 20s, 30s or even older have to put aside a lot more money to partly make up for any cut to benefits. Otherwise, people may risk a sudden drop in their living standard when they retire.
And while lawmakers may, in the end, not decide to make drastic changes in Social Security, many of the financial advisers and other experts we talked to said they were erring on the side of caution and were already recommending that their clients start saving more now.
"People 50 and below should change their planning now to incorporate a benefit cut," said Laurence J. Kotlikoff, an economics professor at Boston University who ran some numbers for us to see what life would be like if the retirement age were immediately raised to 70. That change would translate into a nearly 20 percent cut in benefits, because you would have to wait an extra three years to get the same amount of money, he added.
Several financial planners told us they were assuming that clients in their 30s and 40s might receive just 50 to 80 percent of their full benefits. Or, the advisers say, they may figure that the cost-of-living adjustments applied to benefits won't keep pace with inflation, or some other combination of adjustments. (For the record, executives from AARP said their polls had long shown that younger people were skeptical about receiving full benefits.)
"It's better to be conservative now than risk being underfunded for retirement," said Jorie Johnson, a financial planner in New Jersey.
Mr. Kotlikoff's calculations looked at how a couple's spending and saving patterns might have to change if the government raised the full retirement age to 70 (we assumed it was imposed right away, though such a change would probably be phased in over many years). That would essentially translate to a 19 percent cut in monthly benefits, according to Mr. Kotlikoff. He performed the calculations using his company's retirement planning software, ESPlanner, which shows what people need to save to ensure a consistent standard of living over the course of their lives.
Our examples illustrate how a cut in benefits might feel if you had longer to plan for it -- say, you were 35 years old when the system changed. We also looked at the repercussions for a 45-year-old or a 55-year-old.
In all cases, we based our assumptions on a married couple with two children and a $350,000 mortgage on a house in New York State. They save 10 to 15 percent of their income during their careers (the rate rises as they age) as well as an additional $100,000 for their children's college education. They earn a conservative 2 percent above inflation on their retirement savings and retire at 65 but take Social Security benefits at 67, three years before full retirement age.
Some people may not have the wherewithal to save a whole lot more. Indeed, about half of all recipients start collecting benefits as soon as they're eligible, at age 62, because in some cases Social Security is their main income.
But here's how a family with more flexibility might fare:
AT 35 YEARS OLD At this stage, our couple are earning $120,000 ($60,000 each) and they have $75,000 in total retirement savings. But to make up for the decline in Social Security benefits, they need to save about $84,474 above and beyond what they are already saving before they retire. We assume they save the extra money in a taxable account that allows for easy access, because they are already saving 10 percent or more of their total income in a 401(k). That extra money saved is equivalent to about a 7.8 percent increase in total retirement savings, across all accounts. This also means they'll have less discretionary income -- about 9.4 percent less to be exact -- to spend each year, over the course of their lives.
AT 45 YEARS OLD Our couple now earn $140,000 and has amassed about $255,000 in a 401(k) account. But if they learn their Social Security benefits are going to be cut by nearly 20 percent, they will need to save nearly an extra $90,000 -- which is about 8.3 percent more in their taxable and tax-deferred accounts -- by the time they retire. To do that, they need to cut their discretionary spending by about 9.7 percent a year for the rest of their lives.
"They have a larger permanent reduction in their living standard than the 35-year-olds because they have fewer years to adjust," Professor Kotlikoff said. "They can't spread out the loss in spending power over as many years."
AT 55 YEARS OLD Informing people a mere decade from retirement that their Social Security payments will be cut or that the retirement age will rise, is not likely, experts said. Even so, let's assume the worst for a moment.
At 55, our couple are earning about $175,000, and has nearly $525,000 in total retirement savings. But to help offset the lost Social Security money, they will need to save $82,900 more -- or nearly 7.7 percent across all accounts -- over the next decade. To do that, they will have to spend 10.4 percent less each year.
"Increases in Social Security's retirement age is another way to say Social Security benefit cut," Professor Kotlikoff said. "And big benefit cuts, like those being contemplated, will mean big hits to the spending power of the affected generations. Younger cohorts would suffer less pain, but for a longer time, while older cohorts experience more pain for a shorter time. Either way you cut it, it hurts."
One financial planner, who has dual citizenship in the United States and Greece, said he was not taking chances. "Having seen what happened in Greece, I feel even more strongly today that I should not count on any Social Security for me and my younger clients," said the planner, George Papadopoulos, 43, of Novi, Mich. "I will continue to tell clients not to highly rely on Social Security and think of any money coming their way as gravy."

CHARTS: Shifting Your Finances if Social Security Changes: Younger people would probably be the most affected if Congress makes changes to Social Security to shore up the program's finances -- either because of a rise in the age of eligibilty for full benefits or a cut in monthly payments. To compensate for any cuts, people would need to both save more for retirement and trim their spending. FOR EXAMPLE: Here's how a 35-year-old couple with two children would have to respond to offset a 19 percent cut in monthly Social Security benefits. Each initially earns $60,000 a year and each have saved $37,500 for retirement. They have a $350,000 mortgage and live in New York State. SAVINGS, INCLUDING RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS, MUST GROW: Includes two 401(k) accounts with employer contributions that earn a 2 percent return above inflation, and taxable savings.; DISCRETIONARY SPENDING MUST FALL FOR EACH ADULT: Measures money left over after housing costs, taxes and retirement and college savings. Number is adjusted for the economies of shared living and the presence of children. (Source: Financial calculations provided by Laurence J. Kotlikoff, ESPlanner.com) (B4)

Full text: Portland, Ore.
GENERAL MOTORS introduced America to the Chevrolet Volt at the 2007 Detroit Auto Show as a low-slung concept car that would someday be the future of motorized transportation. It would go 40 miles on battery power alone, promised G.M., after which it would create its own electricity with a gas engine. Three and a half years -- and one government-assisted bankruptcy later -- G.M. is bringing a Volt to market that makes good on those two promises. The problem is, well, everything else.
For starters, G.M.'s vision turned into a car that costs $41,000 before relevant tax breaks ... but after billions of dollars of government loans and grants for the Volt's development and production. And instead of the sleek coupe of 2007, it looks suspiciously similar to a Toyota Prius. It also requires premium gasoline, seats only four people (the battery runs down the center of the car, preventing a rear bench) and has less head and leg room than the $17,000 Chevrolet Cruze, which is more or less the non-electric version of the Volt.
In short, the Volt appears to be exactly the kind of green-at-all-costs car that some opponents of the bailout feared the government might order G.M. to build. Unfortunately for this theory, G.M. was already committed to the Volt when it entered bankruptcy. And though President Obama's task force reported in 2009 that the Volt "will likely be too expensive to be commercially successful in the short term," it didn't cancel the project.
Nor did the government or G.M. decide to sell the Volt at a loss, which, paradoxically, might have been the best hope for making it profitable. Consider the Prius. Back in 1997, Toyota began selling the high-tech, first-of-its-kind car in Japan for about $17,000, even though each model cost $32,000 to build.
By taking a loss on the first several years of Prius production, Toyota was able to hold its price steady, and then sell the gas-sippers in huge numbers when oil prices soared. Today a Prius costs roughly the same in inflation-adjusted dollars as those 1997 models did, and it has become the best-selling Toyota in the United States after the evergreen Camry and Corolla.
Instead of following Toyota's model, G.M. decided to make the Volt more affordable by offering a $350-a-month lease over 36 months. But that offer allows only 12,000 miles per year, or about 33 miles per day. Assuming you charged your Volt every evening, giving you 40 miles of battery power, and wanted to keep below the mileage limit, you would rarely use its expensive range-extending gas engine. No wonder the Volt's main competition, the Nissan Leaf, forgoes the additional combustion engine -- and ends up costing $8,000 less as a result.
In the industry, some suspect that G.M. and the Obama administration decided against selling the Volt at a loss because they want the company to appear profitable before its long-awaited initial stock offering, which is likely to take place next month. For taxpayers, that approach might have made sense if the government planned on selling its entire 61 percent stake in G.M. But the administration has said it will sell only enough equity in the public offering to relinquish its controlling stake in G.M. Thus the government will remain exposed to the company's (and the Volt's) long-term fate.
So the future of General Motors (and the $50 billion taxpayer investment in it) now depends on a vehicle that costs $41,000 but offers the performance and interior space of a $15,000 economy car. The company is moving forward on a second generation of Volts aimed at eliminating the initial model's considerable shortcomings. (In truth, the first-generation Volt was as good as written off inside G.M., which decided to cut its 2011 production volume to a mere 10,000 units rather than the initial plan for 60,000.) Yet G.M. seemingly has no plan for turning its low-volume "eco-flagship" into a mass-market icon like the Prius.
Quantifying just how much taxpayer money will have been wasted on the hastily developed Volt is no easy feat. Start with the $50 billion bailout (without which none of this would have been necessary), add $240 million in Energy Department grants doled out to G.M. last summer, $150 million in federal money to the Volt's Korean battery supplier, up to $1.5 billion in tax breaks for purchasers and other consumer incentives, and some significant portion of the $14 billion loan G.M. got in 2008 for "retooling" its plants, and you've got some idea of how much taxpayer cash is built into every Volt.
In the end, making the bailout work -- whatever the cost -- is the only good reason for buying a Volt. The car is not just an environmental hair shirt (a charge leveled at the Prius early in its existence), it is an act of political self-denial as well.
If G.M. were honest, it would market the car as a personal donation for, and vote of confidence in, the auto bailout. Unfortunately, that's not the kind of cross-branding that will make the Volt a runaway success.

Full text: The war in Afghanistan will consume more money this year alone than we spent on the Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, the Mexican-American War, the Civil War and the Spanish-American War -- combined.
A recent report from the Congressional Research Service finds that the war on terror, including Afghanistan and Iraq, has been, by far, the costliest war in American history aside from World War II. It adjusted costs of all previous wars for inflation.
Those historical comparisons should be a wake-up call to President Obama, underscoring how our military strategy is not only a mess -- as the recent leaked documents from Afghanistan suggested -- but also more broadly reflects a gross misallocation of resources. One legacy of the 9/11 attacks was a distortion of American policy: By the standards of history and cost-effectiveness, we are hugely overinvested in military tools and underinvested in education and diplomacy.
It was reflexive for liberals to rail at President George W. Bush for jingoism. But it is President Obama who is now requesting 6.1 percent more in military spending than the peak of military spending under Mr. Bush. And it is Mr. Obama who has tripled the number of American troops in Afghanistan since he took office. (A bill providing $37 billion to continue financing America's two wars was approved by the House on Tuesday and is awaiting his signature.)
Under Mr. Obama, we are now spending more money on the military, after adjusting for inflation, than in the peak of the cold war, Vietnam War or Korean War. Our battle fleet is larger than the next 13 navies combined, according to Defense Secretary Robert Gates. The intelligence apparatus is so bloated that, according to The Washington Post, the number of people with "top secret" clearance is 1.5 times the population of the District of Columbia.
Meanwhile, a sobering report from the College Board says that the United States, which used to lead the world in the proportion of young people with college degrees, has dropped to 12th.
What's more, an unbalanced focus on weapons alone is often counterproductive, creating a nationalist backlash against foreign "invaders." Over all, education has a rather better record than military power in neutralizing foreign extremism. And the trade-offs are staggering: For the cost of just one soldier in Afghanistan for one year, we could start about 20 schools there. Hawks retort that it's impossible to run schools in Afghanistan unless there are American troops to protect them. But that's incorrect.
CARE, a humanitarian organization, operates 300 schools in Afghanistan, and not one has been burned by the Taliban. Greg Mortenson, of "Three Cups of Tea" fame, has overseen the building of 145 schools in Afghanistan and Pakistan and operates dozens more in tents or rented buildings -- and he says that not one has been destroyed by the Taliban either.
Aid groups show that it is quite possible to run schools so long as there is respectful consultation with tribal elders and buy-in from them. And my hunch is that CARE and Mr. Mortenson are doing more to bring peace to Afghanistan than Mr. Obama's surge of troops.
The American military has been eagerly reading "Three Cups of Tea" but hasn't absorbed the central lesson: building schools is a better bet for peace than firing missiles (especially when one cruise missile costs about as much as building 11 schools).
Mr. Mortenson lamented to me that for the cost of just 246 soldiers posted for one year, America could pay for a higher education plan for all Afghanistan. That would help build an Afghan economy, civil society and future -- all for one-quarter of 1 percent of our military spending in Afghanistan this year.
The latest uproar over Pakistani hand-holding with the Afghan Taliban underscores that billions of dollars in U.S. military aid just doesn't buy the loyalty it used to. In contrast, education can actually transform a nation. That's one reason Bangladesh is calmer than Pakistan, Oman is less threatening than Yemen.
Paradoxically, the most eloquent advocate in government for balance in financing priorities has been Mr. Gates, the defense secretary. He has noted that the military has more people in its marching bands than the State Department has diplomats.
Faced with constant demands for more, Mr. Gates in May asked: "Is it a dire threat that by 2020 the United States will have only 20 times more advanced stealth fighters than China?"
In the presidential campaign, Mr. Obama promised to invest in a global education fund. Since then, he seems to have forgotten the idea -- even though he is spending enough every five weeks in Afghanistan to ensure that practically every child on our planet gets a primary education.
We won our nation's independence for $2.4 billion in today's money, the Congressional Research Service report said. That was good value, considering that we now fritter the same amount every nine days in Afghanistan. Mr. Obama, isn't it time to rebalance our priorities?

Full text: Luis Corvalan, the longtime leader of the Chilean Communist Party whose support was critical to the rise in 1970 of Salvador Allende, the first elected Marxist head of state in the Western Hemisphere, died in Santiago on July 21. He was 93.
The Communist Party of Chile announced his death with "deep pain."
The party, which grew to be the largest Communist party in Latin America, was the backbone of the leftist coalition led by Mr. Allende, a doctor and leader of the Socialist Party. Without Communist support, Mr. Allende's narrow victory in the 1970 presidential election would have been arithmetically impossible.
Mr. Allende, who nationalized Chile's industries once in office, committed suicide as he was being overthrown in a military coup in 1973. Mr. Corvalan, a close adviser to Mr. Allende, fled after the coup, and his only son died under torture while refusing to reveal his father's whereabouts.
Mr. Corvalan was later found and imprisoned and then traded for the Soviet dissident Vladimir K. Bukovsky in 1976.
Mr. Corvalan emerged from a peasant background to become one of South America's most prominent Communists, leading the Chilean party for three decades. He rigorously followed the party line set in Moscow, down to supporting the Soviet Union's invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968. But when the same party line increasingly called for more cooperation with non-Communists than Mr. Allende's Socialists advocated, Mr. Corvalan responded with ideological agility.
"We do not put all Christian Democrats in the same bag," he said to a Chilean party congress, referring to a party to the right of the Marxist coalition.
He criticized Mr. Allende's economic management and distanced himself from many Socialists' infatuation with Cuban-style armed revolution. Sounding like a conservative economist, he said Mr. Allende's decision to increase workers' wages without requiring improvements in productivity was the cause of soaring inflation.
Mr. Corvalan felt secure enough even to criticize Mr. Allende personally, saying he slipped into cliches and repeated himself. Mr. Allende "showed signs of stagnation," he wrote in 1997, adding, "The people's movement had developed further than he had."
Mr. Corvalan's latitude was considerably more restricted when it came to views at odds with those of Russian Communists. After a visit to China in 1959, he praised that country's approach to Marxism. But when relations between China and Russia soured in 1961, he condemned Maoism.
Mr. Corvalan was elected secretary general, or leader, of the Chilean Communist Party in 1958 and held the post until 1990.
Luis Nicolas Corvalan Lepez (he later dropped the "z" from his maternal surname) was born on Sept. 14, 1916, in Pelluco, Chile, one of six siblings. His mother was a seamstress. When Luis was 5, his father abandoned the family. The boy was taught to read by a friend of his mother's who shared their quarters.
Mr. Corvalan was trained as a teacher but found work as a writer and editor for Communist newspapers. The Communist Party was outlawed in 1947, and he was put in detention camps. After it became legal in 1958, he was elected to the town council of Concepcion and twice elected a national senator.
In the 1970s, the Chilean Communist Party had an estimated 50,000 members, making it the largest piece of the Allende coalition after the Socialists. Mr. Corvalan's party was viewed as speaking for all the Communist parties of South America, and its success in electoral politics was admired.
The Chilean Communists were nonetheless seen as staid, and Mr. Corvalan was considered dull. "His pedantic speeches, drab suits and old-fashioned slouch hat seem ill calculated to inspire Chile's young," The New York Times wrote in 1968.
But The Times said he had begun to spruce up his image, noting that he had taken to wearing bright ties, smiling for cameras and posing with young miniskirted Communist women.
After the Allende government fell and Mr. Corvalan fled, the military authorities, hunting him, seized his son, Alberto. Alberto was tortured but remained silent and died of his wounds.
Recent obituaries in the Chilean press said Mr. Corvalan was survived by a wife and an unspecified number of daughters.
Mr. Corvalan was soon found and imprisoned. In October 1973, reports that he was about to be executed set off a raucous debate at the United Nations. The Chilean delegate insisted that no sentence had yet been imposed. Mr. Corvalan was later convicted of high treason.
In 1974, while being held at a Chilean prison on Dawson Island in the Strait of Magellan, the Soviet Union awarded him the Order of Lenin and made his release a cause celebre by repeatedly bringing up the subject in international forums.
With the United States acting as intermediary, a prisoner swap was arranged. Mr. Bukovsky, who had documented that nonconformists were being sent to Soviet psychiatric hospitals, was released by the Kremlin and settled in England.
Mr. Corvalan, released by Chile, went to Moscow and there lived the life of a V.I.P. According to some reports, he had plastic surgery and returned to Chile incognito in the 1980s to organize resistance to the Chilean government.
He re-emerged publicly in Chile in 1989, the year Gen. Augusto Pinochet lost a bid to retain power, and was said to have worked on a memoir for years without ever finishing it.

Abstract: [...] BP may find it politically difficult to make all the costs tax deductible. A 12 percent drop from here would bring home prices in line with the decade's consumer price inflation.

Full text: BP is sounding decisive and radical. The beleaguered British oil major is expanding its existing asset disposal program to $30 billion and looking to cut debt after announcing a $32 billion charge on its Gulf of Mexico oil spill in Tuesday's earnings report. And Tony Hayward is to step down as chief executive. But for Mr. Hayward's American successor, Robert Dudley, one big challenge is to turn this into a convincing story for the company's stock.
The big second-quarter charge is BP's best guess at its spill liabilities. It is well below some worst-case estimates of $50 billion or more. And BP is assuming the costs can be written off against tax, leaving a net cost of $22 billion.
In the end, BP may find it politically difficult to make all the costs tax deductible. It is also banking on not being found grossly negligent. If it were, Clean Water Act fines would be significantly higher. The company's assumption for the amount of oil spilled, which determines fines, is also below the top end of the federal estimates.
On the other hand, the final cost could be lower if BP's partners in the stricken gulf well assume their 35 percent share of the liability.
BP is, in any event, retaining financial flexibility. The company is still a formidable money machine. It generated nearly $9 billion of operating cash flow in the second quarter. The decision to sell assets to cover the bulk of the spill costs should cut net debt from $23 billion to as low as $10 billion over the next 18 months.
It won't be easy for BP to get good prices for all the assets it wants to sell. But last week's $7 billion deal with Apache shows the company has holdings that are worth more to others. If Mr. Dudley can keep that going with other disposals, the new, smaller BP will have a more concentrated portfolio of quality assets.
That provides the makings of an attractive story for equity investors -- especially if a stronger balance sheet is part of the equation. But a recovering BP could also be an attractive acquisition target for a stronger rival. The plan Mr. Dudley must execute is risky and offers no quick fix. He faces a nervous honeymoon.
Testing the Tests
Don't be fooled into believing the housing market in the United States is rebounding. True, May's Case-Shiller 20-city house price index bounced 4.6 percent year-on-year. But that was driven largely by the federal home buyer tax credit, an artificial one-time stimulus. With jobs scarce and confidence falling, a further drop now looks likely. That will test the limits of last year's bank stress tests.
The $8,000 tax credit was valid for contracts entered into before April 30. So house prices in the three months to May benefited from an unnatural support. Both new and existing home sales have declined since the end of April, suggesting a sag in home prices to come.
Meanwhile, the Case-Shiller index still stands some 47 percent above where it was in January 2000, against a consumer price index rise of 29 percent over the same period. While the United States has enjoyed economic and population growth since 2000, the housing market was already buoyant at the turn of the century. A 12 percent drop from here would bring home prices in line with the decade's consumer price inflation.
That would further erode confidence and dent consumer balance sheets. It would also ding bank earnings and capital. Last year's Federal Reserve-led bank stress tests involved a "base case" that included a housing price decline of 17.4 percent from December 2008 levels by 2010, and a second "adverse" case based on a 27.5 percent decline.
The good news is that house prices are currently only 2.1 percent below their levels in December 2008. So even a 15 percent further decline would take them only to the base case level used in the stress tests. But an uptick in joblessness combined with further house price declines would get closer to the adverse case.
If regulators' calculations on bank capital were right, even that wouldn't presage another banking crisis because the Fed forced larger banks to raise sufficient capital to handle the adverse case. But it would hurt earnings and probably cause banks to become even more cautious about lending. That could make any double dip doubly bad.

In Study, 2 Economists Say Intervention Helped Avert a 2nd Depression

Abstract: In a new paper, the economists argue that without the Wall Street bailout, the bank stress tests, the emergency lending and asset purchases by the Federal Reserve, and the Obama administration's fiscal stimulus program, the nation's gross domestic product would be about 6.5 percent lower this year.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Like a mantra, officials from both the Bush and Obama administrations have trumpeted how the government's sweeping interventions to prop up the economy since 2008 helped avert a second Depression.
Now, two leading economists wielding complex quantitative models say that assertion can be empirically proved.
In a new paper, the economists argue that without the Wall Street bailout, the bank stress tests, the emergency lending and asset purchases by the Federal Reserve, and the Obama administration's fiscal stimulus program, the nation's gross domestic product would be about 6.5 percent lower this year.
In addition, there would be about 8.5 million fewer jobs, on top of the more than 8 million already lost; and the economy would be experiencing deflation, instead of low inflation.
The paper, by Alan S. Blinder, a Princeton professor and former vice chairman of the Fed, and Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, represents a first stab at comprehensively estimating the effects of the economic policy responses of the last few years.
"While the effectiveness of any individual element certainly can be debated, there is little doubt that in total, the policy response was highly effective," they write.
Mr. Blinder and Mr. Zandi emphasize the sheer size of the fallout from the financial crisis. They estimate the total direct cost of the recession at $1.6 trillion, and the total budgetary cost, after adding in nearly $750 billion in lost revenue from the weaker economy, at $2.35 trillion, or about 16 percent of G.D.P.
By comparison, the savings and loan crisis cost about $350 billion in today's dollars: $275 billion in direct cost and an additional $75 billion from the recession of 1990-91 -- or about 6 percent of G.D.P. at the time.
But the new analysis might not be of immediate solace to officials in the Obama administration, who have been trying to promote the "summer of recovery" at events across the nation in the face of polls indicating persistent doubts about the impact of the $787 billion stimulus program.
For one thing, Mr. Blinder and Mr. Zandi find that the financial stabilization measures -- the Troubled Asset Relief Program, as the bailout is known, along with the bank stress tests and the Fed's actions -- have had a relatively greater impact than the stimulus program.
If the fiscal stimulus alone had been enacted, and not the financial measures, they concluded, real G.D.P. would have fallen 5 percent last year, with 12 million jobs lost. But if only the financial measures had been enacted, and not the stimulus, real G.D.P. would have fallen nearly 4 percent, with 10 million jobs lost.
The combined effects of both sets of policies cannot be directly compared with the sum of each in isolation, they found, "because the policies tend to reinforce each other."
Told about the findings, another leading economist was unconvinced.
"I'm very surprised that they find these big impacts," said John B. Taylor, a Stanford professor and a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution. "It doesn't correspond at all to my empirical work."
Mr. Taylor said the Fed had successfully stabilized the commercial paper and money markets, but he argued that its purchases of $1.25 trillion in mortgage-backed securities have not been effective. And he said the Obama administration's stimulus program has had "very little impact and not much to show for it except a legacy of higher debt."
The disagreement underscored the extent to which econometric estimates are heavily reliant on underlying assumptions and models, but Mr. Blinder and Mr. Zandi said they hoped their analysis would withstand scrutiny by other scholars.
"When all is said and done, the financial and fiscal policies will have cost taxpayers a substantial sum, but not nearly as much as most had feared and not nearly as much as if policy makers had not acted at all," they write.

The War: A Trillion Can Be Cheap

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Like everything else, war is a lot more expensive than it used to be.
The conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan have cost Americans a staggering $1 trillion to date, second only in inflation-adjusted dollars to the $4 trillion price tag for World War II, when the United States put 16 million men and women into uniform and fought on three continents.
Sticker shock is the inevitable first reaction to the latest statistics on the costs of all major United States wars since the American Revolution, compiled by the Congressional Research Service and released late last month, and the figures promise to play into intensifying political and economic pressures to restrain the Pentagon budget.
Still, 21st-century technology is an obvious explanation for why two relatively small (although long) wars in developing societies like Iraq and Afghanistan are so expensive. As Stephen Daggett, a specialist in defense policy and budgets, writes in the Congressional Research Service report, in the Revolutionary War "the most sophisticated weaponry was a 36-gun frigate that is hardly comparable to a modern $3.5 billion destroyer."
A second look at the numbers shows another story underneath. In 2008, the peak year so far of war spending for Iraq and Afghanistan, the costs amounted to only 1.2 percent of America's gross domestic product. During the peak year of spending on World War II, 1945, the costs came to nearly 36 percent of G.D.P.
The reason is the immense growth, and seemingly limitless credit, of the United States economy over the last 65 years, as compared to the sacrifice and unity required to wring $4 trillion from a much smaller economy to wage the earlier war. To some historians, the difference is troubling.
"The army is at war, but the country is not," said David M. Kennedy, the Stanford University historian. "We have managed to create and field an armed force that can engage in very, very lethal warfare without the society in whose name it fights breaking a sweat." The result, he said, is "a moral hazard for the political leadership to resort to force in the knowledge that civil society will not be deeply disturbed."
A corollary is that taxes have not been raised to pay for Iraq and Afghanistan -- the first time that has happened in an American war since the Revolution, when there was not yet a country to impose them. Rightly or wrongly, that has further cut American civilians off from the two wars on the opposite side of the world.
Before the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, "Americans were called upon by their leaders to pay higher taxes during a war, and grumbling or not grumbling, they did it," said Robert D. Hormats, the under secretary of state for economic, energy and agricultural affairs and the author of "The Price of Liberty: Paying for America's Wars."
In terms of costs per warrior, the current wars appear to be the most expensive ever, according to Todd Harrison, a senior fellow for defense budget studies at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments. Working independently of the Pentagon and of the Congressional study, and using computations based on the number of troops committed to the actual conduct of war at any one time, he estimates that the annual cost today is $1.1 million per man or woman in uniform in Afghanistan versus an adjusted $67,000 per year for troops in World War II and $132,000 in Vietnam.
Although technology is the driving factor, along with the logistical expense of moving equipment over the treacherous and landlocked Afghan terrain, costs per soldier have also risen because of the price of maintaining a better-trained and higher-paid force. "We're not just pulling random guys off the street and sending them off to war like we did in the past," Mr. Harrison said.
A last story in the numbers: A quick calculation shows that the United States has been at war for 47 of its 230 years, or 20 percent of its history. Put another way, Americans have been at war one year out of every five.
"You know, it's a surprise to me that it's that high," said Mr. Daggett, who has focused on the cost, not length, of wars. "You think of war as not being the usual state."
