Full text: EVEN in a bad year, some people can get very lucky.
A newly released report by the Internal Revenue Service shows that, for Americans as a group, total income fell at the fastest pace in decades in 2008, and that the number of tax returns reporting at least $1 million in income plunged by 22 percent as the Great Recession took hold.
But even with all the bad news, there were still 13,480 tax returns that reported income of more than $10 million in the year.
Among them were 462 returns that reported some income from gambling. Their total income from that source was $2.6 billion, for an average of $5.6 million per return.
The report, based on a survey of tax returns for 2008, states that Americans reported $8.4 trillion in total income, down 4.6 percent from the previous year. After considering inflation, the real decline was 8.4 percent, the sharpest decline in total American income since at least 1990.
That decline was largely caused by falls in investment income and sharp drops in capital gains. Despite the recession, total wage and salary income in the United States rose by 1.9 percent in 2008, the I.R.S. said. But after adjusting for inflation, that became a decline of 1.9 percent. The real decline in wage and salary incomes was also the largest since 1990, which was as far back as the I.R.S. report covered.
For some Americans, that decline was partly offset by the availability of unemployment insurance benefits. The number of tax returns reporting such benefits was 9.5 million, up 25 percent from the year before, and the total of reported unemployment benefits was $43.7 billion, up 48 percent.
Most of those benefits were reported on tax returns showing total income of less than $40,000 a year, and 90 percent of it was reported on returns that showed total income under $100,000.
The number of tax returns that reported at least $1 million in annual income fell by 22 percent, to 321,294, while the subset of that group reporting at least $10 million in income was 36 percent smaller.
On the other end of the spectrum, the number of tax returns on which taxpayers reported negative income -- because their realized losses were greater than their total income -- leaped 31 percent, to 2.5 million.
The report reflects the number of tax returns, not the number of people. Most returns are filed by individuals, but nearly a third are joint returns filed by married couples.
While there were fewer returns reporting $1 million incomes, they collectively still reported income of $1.08 trillion. Those returns accounted for just 0.2 percent of the returns filed, but reported taking in 13 percent of all income.
That proportion was down from 16.1 percent in 2007, however, and was the lowest since 2004, reflecting the impact of the collapse in asset values on those who owned the most assets.
The I.R.S. disclosure of combined tax return information for the wealthiest taxpayers -- those with annual incomes of $10 million or more -- provides glimpses into the lives of the super-rich.
Some of them, it turns out, know what it is like to stand in line at the unemployment office. Seventeen of those returns included income from unemployment benefits, averaging $5,765 each. The service had not broken out that detail in previous years.
Of those tax returns of $10 million or more, 20 reported receiving alimony payments, averaging about $5 million, while 455 reported paying alimony averaging $455,588.
Most people in that rarefied group are there because of their investments, not their work. Of the $400 billion in income reported on those 13,480 returns, only 19 percent of it came from wages and salaries, much less than came from capital gains, even in such a bad year for stocks.
It turns out that there were fewer superlucky people in 2008 as well. In the previous year, 546 returns showing total income of at least $10 million reported gambling income, and those returns showed average gambling income of $6.6 million.

Full text: LONDON -- Britain and Germany reported surprisingly optimistic economic data on Friday, offering a welcome respite from the otherwise gloomy outlook around the world.
Britain stunned economists with a 1.1 percent increase in its gross domestic product in the second quarter from the first quarter, according to the Office for National Statistics. That was almost twice the rate that had been expected.
In Germany, business confidence rose in July to its highest level since reunification. The euro and the pound rose against the dollar on Friday.
What is still unclear is whether the figures illustrate just a temporary improvement in an economic environment that continues to struggle with lack of credit and the prospect of lower government spending, or whether they are a sign that investors and economists alike have been overly pessimistic about the strength of the economy.
"The concern about sovereign debt has put the markets on a pessimistic footing at the beginning of the year," said Stuart Green, an economist at HSBC in London. "Perhaps that diverted attention away from the economic cycle."
But Mr. Green also warned that the positive data "does not really alter the fundamental questions" about the economies of Britain and the Continent. Whether they are strong enough to cope with the double challenge of Europewide austerity programs and a banking system whose stability and reluctance to lend is still cause for some concern.
Economic growth in Britain in the quarter was the result of a 0.9 percent increase of services, which make up the bulk of the gross domestic product. The British pub, hotel and coffee chain operator Whitbread said last month that sales were improving and that it planned to add more coffee shops and hotels.
Manufacturing was up 1.6 percent in the second quarter, from the first quarter, and construction grew by 6.6 percent after much work was postponed from the first quarter because of bad weather. Economists warned, however, that the large increase should be taken with a grain of salt because the data was based on a new type of survey.
Germany's economy had already been experiencing a stronger recovery than many of its European neighbors, helped by strong exports of manufactured goods. But Friday's figures are even more encouraging, economists said.
The German carmaker BMW raised its earnings forecast for this year earlier this month, and Daimler has said it would do the same when it released results next week.
The positive data came after a caution from Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, earlier in the week that the outlook for growth in the United States was "unusually uncertain."
The recent data also took the Bank of England's monetary policy committee by surprise. The policy makers said earlier this month that the prospect for a stronger economy "deteriorated a little" and that "a softening in the medium-term outlook for G.D.P. growth over recent months" would put pressure on inflation, which had remained relatively high this year.
Howard Archer, a senior economist at IHS Global Insight, called Friday's economic data from Britain a "major, pleasant surprise" but added that "activity will be relatively muted and bumpy in the second half" because "serious headwinds persist."

Full text: BEIJING
ADVOCATING democracy in a single-party, authoritarian state would seem to be a fool's errand.
Wei Jingsheng, one of China's most ardent pro-democracy dissidents, spent over a decade in jail for demanding multiparty elections. Last year, the writer Liu Xiaobo was given an 11-year sentence after he wrote a manifesto calling for an end to the Chinese Communist Party's hold on power.
Then there is Yu Keping, a mild-mannered policy wonk who has been singing the praises of democracy for years. In his most famous essay, "Democracy Is a Good Thing," he made an impassioned argument for the inevitability of direct elections in China, describing democracy as "the best political system for humankind."
In April, he published another treatise calling on the Communist Party to abide by the Constitution, not a small matter in a country where government leaders often argue that the law should be subservient to the party.
A cynical troublemaker playing with fire? Hardly.
Mr. Yu's writings are sold in state-owned bookstores, and he is a ranking Communist Party official in charge of the Central Compilation and Translation Bureau, an obscure agency dedicated to translating works by Chinese leaders and Marxist tracts from around the world. He also runs a policy research organization, China Center for Comparative Politics and Economics, that provides advice to China's leadership.
Even China experts have a hard time determining whether Mr. Yu is a brave voice for change or simply a well-placed shill.
Mr. Yu, 51, a deceptively soft-spoken man who is fond of guns and off-road driving, does little to clarify his role. "I am only a scholar interested in academic research," he said with a grin, surrounded by hundreds of books in his Beijing office.
A closer look at Mr. Yu provides a small window into the role of those few public intellectuals who have learned to navigate what would appear to be treacherous terrain. They tackle seemingly provocative subjects and can even function as a force for change, but in the end their writings rarely challenge the underpinnings of China's single-party, authoritarian rule.
Even Mr. Yu's use of the word "democracy" is not what it seems. China's leaders frequently talk about it as a worthy goal, but in practice they have virtually no intention of ceding the Communist Party's monopoly. In fact, Mr. Yu never advocates Western-style multiparty democracy.
"What he writes might sound good, but he is misleading the Chinese people into thinking the government is moving toward democracy," said Guo Tianguo, a former rights lawyer from Shanghai who was forced into exile five years ago and now lives in Canada. "He owes his job to President Hu Jintao, and if he ever pushed too hard he would lose everything. He's a coward."
YET to some who have followed his career, Mr. Yu's role is far more nuanced. They say that he is a true believer in democracy, but that he walks a tightrope, trying to nudge China's political elite toward reform without upsetting the apple cart.
Minxin Pei, a specialist in Chinese politics at Claremont McKenna College, said that Mr. Yu is a uniquely Chinese public figure who tries to influence the system through carefully choreographed words and well-placed obfuscation. "He's flexible in the sense that if the atmosphere were more tolerant, he'd go further," he said. "But he knows that going too far won't do any good for him or the larger cause he's promoting."
During a series of recent interviews, Mr. Yu was relaxed and loquacious, but his responses hewed closely to his writings, which call for the incremental introduction of democracy "when conditions are right." But he also stepped beyond the vague pronouncements on democracy that have been uttered by Mr. Hu, who has suggested that China already enjoys widespread political liberties.
Asked whether he thought the Chinese political system could be described as democratic, Mr. Yu offered up a few examples of reforms that have been tried in rural townships or small provincial cities but then added, "We have a long way to go."
Like many of his peers, Mr. Yu grew up in the tumult of Mao's Cultural Revolution, the decade between 1966 and 1976 when concepts like universal rights and free speech were viewed as bourgeois contaminants from the West. Class struggle was the watchword of the day, and Mr. Yu, the son of rice farmers from coastal Zhejiang Province, was anointed the leader of his school's Red Guard battalion. He was not quite 10 years old.
He recalled terrorizing landlords and merchants during so-called struggle sessions, a wooden revolver tucked into his pants. "I was so small I had to stand on a chair," he said.
In 1978, two years after the death of Mao, during the gradual return to normalcy and the reopening of schools, he was one of the first of his generation to go to college. "I literally crawled out of the paddies to take the entrance exam," he said, smiling and shaking his head at the memory.
Mr. Yu was a teacher at Peking University during the spring of 1989, and he said he went to Tiananmen Square several times to look after his students, who were part of the throngs protesting corruption and inflation and demanding democratic reforms. "I was so worried about them," he said, recalling the denouement -- a bloody military crackdown in which hundreds died -- as "a regrettable tragedy."
But he said those events taught him that China must have legal avenues for its citizens to express their disdain for injustice, or their desire for change. "In any nation, when people are demanding reform, this is a sign of prosperity," he said. "To ignore these demands is to invite instability."
Mr. Yu said he was impressed by the United States, where he was a visiting scholar at Duke University. He relishes memories of the intellectual give-and-take in the classroom and the unencumbered vigor of the news media. "I really loved the American can-do spirit, the values of equality and justice, and the way people cared about the environment," he said. For all the open-mindedness of Americans, he still winces when he recalls the barbed reactions of people when they learned he was a member of the Communist Party.
HIS most indelible experiences came after he left Duke to travel across 30 states on a Greyhound bus. He said he saw the chasm between the grotesquely rich and the abjectly poor, the lack of respect for the elderly, and the apathy on Election Day, especially among the "common people" who would seem to be the most invested in political change.
Mr. Yu also had a personal brush with a downside of abundant liberty. He said he was mugged twice, once by a man who put a knife to his back in a public restroom in Indianapolis. "I pretended I didn't speak English; someone else came into the bathroom and the man ran away," he said with a laugh.
That experience set off his interest in guns, and Mr. Yu sometimes lets off steam at a shooting range in Beijing. His other distraction from the esoteric is off-road driving. "She's terrified of my driving," he said of his wife, Xu Xiuli, a professor of Chinese economic history.
Before ending the interview, he had one parting thought. The story about his childhood, he said, contained a lesson, and it came back to his passion. "When I think about those days of the Cultural Revolution it reminds me of one truth," he said. "It is only democracy and the rule of law that can save China from ever again falling into that kind of fate."

Full text: The 3M Company, which makes a wide variety of industrial and consumer products, said Thursday that its quarterly net income rose 43 percent and raised its full-year outlook.
The company, which makes products that range from Post-it stickers to film for flat-screen TVs, said its profit rose to $1.12 billion, or $1.54 a share, from $783 million, or $1.12 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $6.73 billion from $5.72 billion.
Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters expected a profit of $1.48 a share on revenue of $6.66 billion, and stock in 3M, which is based in St. Paul, rose $2.45, to $84.75 a share.
The chief executive, George W. Buckley, said 3M began seeing an economic recovery in June 2009, but he cautioned that economic growth could slow later this year if stimulus spending tapered off faster than the economy picked up.
"This isn't a double-dip per se, it's just a soft spot, and very normal as economic growth takes a breather for a while and adjusts to new circumstances such as higher interest rates, lowering stimulus, or commodity inflation," he said. "All are very normal in my view."
Most of the revenue growth came in Asia, which was up 42 percent, and Latin America and Canada, which were up 21 percent. Sales in the United States rose 9 percent, and sales in Europe rose 4 percent, held back by the weak euro.
Operating profits at the industrial and transportation unit, its biggest division, rose 66 percent to $476 million. The division includes renewable energy, auto parts, and industrial adhesives. The company said operating profit at all of the businesses in that unit improved.
The company now expects full year earnings of $5.65 to $5.80 a share. Wall Street was expecting $5.63.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- After nearly a decade of rapid increases in military spending, the Pentagon is facing intensifying political and economic pressures to restrain its budget, setting up the first serious debate since the terrorist attacks of 2001 about the size and cost of the armed services.
Lawmakers, administration officials and analysts said the combination of big budget deficits, the winding down of the war in Iraq and President Obama's pledge to begin pulling troops from Afghanistan next year were leading Congress to contemplate reductions in Pentagon financing requests.
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates has sought to contain the budget-cutting demands by showing Congress and the White House that he can squeeze more efficiency from the Pentagon's bureaucracy and weapons programs and use the savings to maintain fighting forces.
But the increased pressure is already showing up in efforts by Democrats in Congress to move more quickly than senior Pentagon officials had expected in trimming the administration's budget request for next year.
And in the longer term, with concern mounting about the government's $13 trillion debt, a bipartisan deficit-reduction commission is warning that cuts in military spending could be needed to help the nation dig out of its financial hole.
"We're going to have to take a hard look at defense if we are going to be serious about deficit reduction," said Erskine B. Bowles, a chief of staff to President Bill Clinton who is a co-chairman of the deficit commission. Senator Judd Gregg, a Republican from New Hampshire who is also on the debt commission, said that if the panel pushes for cuts in discretionary spending, "defense should be looked at," perhaps through another base-closing commission.
Mr. Gates is calling for the Pentagon's budget to keep growing in the long run at 1 percent a year after inflation, plus the costs of the war. It has averaged an inflation-adjusted growth rate of 7 percent a year over the last decade (nearly 12 percent a year without adjusting for inflation), including the costs of the wars. So far, Mr. Obama has asked Congress for an increase in total spending next year of 2.2 percent, to $708 billion -- 6.1 percent higher than the peak under the Bush administration.
Mr. Gates is arguing that if the Pentagon budget is allowed to keep growing by 1 percent a year, he can find 2 percent or 3 percent in savings in the department's bureaucracy to reinvest in the military -- and that will be sufficient money to meet national security needs. In one of the paradoxes of Washington budget battles, Mr. Gates, even as he tries to forestall deeper cuts, is trying to kill weapons programs he says the military does not need over the objections of members of Congress who want to protect jobs.
Mr. Gates enjoys bipartisan support on Capitol Hill and has considerable sway within the administration. But while he may hold the line against major cuts for now, analysts say support for military spending could erode quickly once the Pentagon withdraws a substantial number of troops from Afghanistan.
"In the case of the Pentagon, they have been living very fat and very happy for so very long that they've almost lost touch with reality," said Gordon Adams, who oversaw national-security budgets under President Clinton.
Senator Daniel K. Inouye, Democrat of Hawaii and chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said that he would be looking first at tax increases and changes in Social Security and Medicare to lower the deficit, and that there was "no way" Congress would make major cuts in the military while more than 100,000 troops were still at war. But once most of them return, "I'm pretty certain cuts are coming -- in defense and the whole budget," he said.
The course of the war in Afghanistan will no doubt have an impact on the debate, as might the outcome of the midterm elections and ultimately the 2012 presidential race.
But the first signs of pressure on military spending have surfaced, as both the House and the Senate are moving to trim the administration's Pentagon budget request for the fiscal year that starts Oct. 1.
The Democrats on the Senate Appropriations Committee voted last week to cut $8 billion from the Pentagon's request for an $18 billion increase in its basic operations.
Representative Norm Dicks, Democrat of Washington and chairman of the House defense appropriations subcommittee, is planning to trim $7 billion from the administration's budget request. "There's a lot of support up here for restraint," he said.
In the short run, the worries about the deficit could help Mr. Gates halt the two main arms programs he has identified this year -- an alternate engine for the new Joint Strike Fighter and the purchase of five more C-17 cargo planes from Boeing.
General Electric and Rolls-Royce have been lobbying hard to save their engine, which would compete with another one for up to $100 billion of business.
Mr. Inouye said that with the administration's opposition, "and faced with a deficit, that deal is dead."
Mr. Gates sought to set the terms of the broader debate with a speech in May at the Eisenhower Presidential Library and Museum in Abilene, Kan.
"Military spending on things large and small can and should expect closer, harsher scrutiny," Mr. Gates said. "The gusher has been turned off, and will stay off for a good period of time."
Mr. Gates followed up with orders for the armed services and the Pentagon's agencies to find $7 billion in spending cuts and efficiencies for 2012, growing to $37 billion annually by 2016.
Rahm Emanuel, Mr. Obama's chief of staff, said the president fully supported Mr. Gates's initiatives, which already have set in motion savings from canceling or trimming more three dozen weapons systems in 2009. "This is not business as usual," Mr. Emanuel said.
Senior administration officials said they hoped Mr. Gates's effort would help quiet critics who asked why military spending had been exempted from the president's order for a 5 percent cut in the budgets of most domestic agencies.
At the moment, the administration projects that the Pentagon's base budget and the extra war spending will peak at $708 billion in the coming fiscal year, though analysts say it is likely that the Pentagon will need at least $30 billion more in supplemental war financing then.
Two-thirds of Pentagon spending is on personnel costs. It is possible that the Pentagon will have to look for the first time at cuts to the health benefits provided to active and retired military personnel and their families.
Some analysts said the Pentagon would eventually come under pressure to reduce the size of the armed forces.
Mr. Adams, the Clinton administration budget official, wrote in a recent analysis that for "any real savings on defense budgets to occur, end strength must shrink." But the Pentagon strongly opposes cutting the number of troops, said Peter R. Orszag, director of the president's Office of Management and Budget.
"Secretary Gates and the military leadership have made it very clear that they do not support a reduction in end strength," Mr. Orszag said.
He said there is little comparison to the last period of significant cuts in military spending and personnel -- in the 1990s, after the collapse of communism.
"During the end of the cold war, one could imagine a significant downsizing of the American military," Mr. Orszag said. "That is a fundamentally different proposition than the situation we find ourselves in today."

Full text: For a couple of years, it was the love that dared not speak his name. In 2008, Republican candidates hardly ever mentioned the president still sitting in the White House. After the election, the G.O.P. did its best to shout down all talk about how we got into the mess we're in, insisting that we needed to look forward, not back. And many in the news media played along, acting as if it was somehow uncouth for Democrats even to mention the Bush era and its legacy.
The truth, however, is that the only problem Republicans ever had with George W. Bush was his low approval rating. They always loved his policies and his governing style -- and they want them back. In recent weeks, G.O.P. leaders have come out for a complete return to the Bush agenda, including tax breaks for the rich and financial deregulation. They've even resurrected the plan to cut future Social Security benefits.
But they have a problem: how can they embrace President Bush's policies, given his record? After all, Mr. Bush's two signature initiatives were tax cuts and the invasion of Iraq; both, in the eyes of the public, were abject failures. Tax cuts never yielded the promised prosperity, but along with other policies -- especially the unfunded war in Iraq -- they converted a budget surplus into a persistent deficit. Meanwhile, the W.M.D. we invaded Iraq to eliminate turned out not to exist, and by 2008 a majority of the public believed not just that the invasion was a mistake but that the Bush administration deliberately misled the nation into war. What's a Republican to do?
You know the answer. There's now a concerted effort under way to rehabilitate Mr. Bush's image on at least three fronts: the economy, the deficit and the war.
On the economy: Last week Mitch McConnell, the Senate minority leader, declared that "there's no evidence whatsoever that the Bush tax cuts actually diminished revenue. They increased revenue, because of the vibrancy of these tax cuts in the economy." So now the word is that the Bush-era economy was characterized by "vibrancy."
I guess it depends on the meaning of the word "vibrant." The actual record of the Bush years was (i) two and half years of declining employment, followed by (ii) four and a half years of modest job growth, at a pace significantly below the eight-year average under Bill Clinton, followed by (iii) a year of economic catastrophe. In 2007, at the height of the "Bush boom," such as it was, median household income, adjusted for inflation, was still lower than it had been in 2000.
But the Bush apologists hope that you won't remember all that. And they also have a theory, which I've been hearing more and more -- namely, that President Obama, though not yet in office or even elected, caused the 2008 slump. You see, people were worried in advance about his future policies, and that's what caused the economy to tank. Seriously.
On the deficit: Republicans are now claiming that the Bush administration was actually a paragon of fiscal responsibility, and that the deficit is Mr. Obama's fault. "The last year of the Bush administration," said Mr. McConnell recently, "the deficit as a percentage of gross domestic product was 3.2 percent, well within the range of what most economists think is manageable. A year and a half later, it's almost 10 percent."
But that 3.2 percent figure, it turns out, is for fiscal 2008 -- which wasn't the last year of the Bush administration, because it ended in September of 2008. In other words, it ended just as the failure of Lehman Brothers -- on Mr. Bush's watch -- was triggering a broad financial and economic collapse. This collapse caused the deficit to soar: By the first quarter of 2009 -- with only a trickle of stimulus funds flowing -- federal borrowing had already reached almost 9 percent of G.D.P. To some of us, this says that the economic crisis that began under Mr. Bush is responsible for the great bulk of our current deficit. But the Republican Party is having none of it.
Finally, on the war: For most Americans, the whole debate about the war is old if painful news -- but not for those obsessed with refurbishing the Bush image. Karl Rove now claims that his biggest mistake was letting Democrats get away with the "shameful" claim that the Bush administration hyped the case for invading Iraq. Let the whitewashing begin!
Again, Republicans aren't trying to rescue George W. Bush's reputation for sentimental reasons; they're trying to clear the way for a return to Bush policies. And this carries a message for anyone hoping that the next time Republicans are in power, they'll behave differently. If you believe that they've learned something -- say, about fiscal prudence or the importance of effective regulation -- you're kidding yourself. You might as well face it: they're addicted to Bush.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve provided most of the money for new mortgages in the United States last year, effectively lending more than $1 trillion to American homeowners.
Now the legacy of that extraordinary intervention is hanging over the central bank as it faces growing demands for an encore to help revive the flagging economy.
While officials and economists generally regard the program as successful in supporting the housing market, it has left the Fed holding a vast pile of mortgage securities -- basically i.o.u.'s from homeowners -- that it does not want and cannot sell.
Holding the securities could cost the Fed a lot of money and hamper its ability to fight inflation, while selling the securities could drain needed money from the still-weak economy.
Fed officials have expressed confidence that they can finesse the dilemma by gradually selling the securities as the economy starts to recover. But they are not eager to expand the challenge they face by beginning a new round of asset-buying, one tool the Fed could use to try to stimulate growth.
"In my view, any judgment to expand the balance sheet further should be subject to strict scrutiny," Kevin M. Warsh, a Fed governor, said in a speech last month in Atlanta. He warned that new purchases could undermine the Fed's "most valuable asset": its credibility.
Some Democrats want the Fed to pump more money into the economy to help reduce unemployment, one of the central bank's basic responsibilities. In testimony before Congress this week, Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said that the Fed retained that option, but did not now plan to expand on the steps it had already taken.
In part, Bernanke and other Fed officials say they believe that new asset purchases would be less effective now that private investors have returned to the market.
The Fed became one of the world's largest mortgage investors because no one else was interested. During the fall 2008 financial crisis, investors stopped buying the mortgage securities issued by the housing finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The two companies buy mortgages made by banks and other lenders, providing money for new rounds of lending, then package those loans into securities for sale to investors, replenishing their own coffers.
Two days before Thanksgiving 2008, the Fed announced that it would buy $500 billion in securities issued by the two companies. By the time the program wound down in March 2010, it had spent more than twice that amount. The central bank now owns mortgage securities with a face value of $1.1 trillion.
A wide range of economists say the Fed's program -- so big that purchases outstripped the issuance of new securities in some months -- helped to preserve the availability of mortgage loans and helped to hold interest rates near record lows. Rates that exceeded 6 percent in late 2008 remain below 5 percent today.
But the Fed now must deal with the cleanup.
The central bank could hold the securities until the borrowers repaid or refinanced their loans. Brian P. Sack, an executive at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, estimated in March that borrowers would repay $200 billion by the end of 2011. And in the meantime, the Fed is collecting regular interest payments.
"We've been earning a fairly high income from our holdings and remitting that to the Treasury," Mr. Bernanke told Congress on Wednesday.
But holding the securities could make it harder to control inflation as the economic recovery gains strength, said Vincent Reinhart, the former head of the Fed's monetary policy division, now a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.
The Fed bought the securities by pumping new money into the economy, stimulating growth. It could be difficult to reverse that effect without draining the money from the economy by selling the securities, Mr. Reinhart said.
"They created reserves, and those reserves ultimately can be inflationary," Mr. Reinhart said. "The chief risk of keeping the balance sheet big and raising rates is that you might not be able to raise rates successfully" because the impact would be mitigated by the effect of the extra money still sloshing around the system.
Holding the securities also could cost the Fed a lot of money.
The Fed paid some of the highest prices on record for mortgage securities, basically accepting very low rates of interest on its investments. As the economy recovers and interest rates rise, the Fed will need to accept increasingly large discounts to make the securities attractive to other investors.
David Zervos, head of global fixed-income strategy at the investment bank Jefferies & Company, estimates that the value of the portfolio will drop almost $50 billion each time interest rates increase by one percentage point.
Selling the securities at a loss would reduce the Fed's ability to transfer profits to the Treasury Department. Large enough losses could reduce the amount of capital held by the Fed, although it can always create more money.
But perhaps the greatest risk is that investors will begin to doubt the Fed's willingness to raise interest rates, knowing that each increase will damage its own balance sheet.
"It compromises their integrity and their inflation-fighting mandate, because fighting inflation would be a direct detriment to their portfolio," Mr. Zervos said.
The Fed could avoid these problems by selling the securities now, before interest rates start to rise. But doing so would reverse the benefits of the original program, draining money from the economy while it still is weak. It would also fly in the face of the demands for the Fed to do more for the economy.
A fire sale also could damage the banking industry by driving down the value of the comparable mortgage securities that banks hold in large quantities.
So far the Federal Open Market Committee, comprising the board of governors and a rotating selection of presidents from the regional reserve banks, has chosen to wait.
The approach favored by most of the committee, according to the minutes of its June meeting, is to start raising interest rates before beginning to sell the securities. By waiting "until the economic recovery was well established," the minutes said, the Fed would limit the impact of the asset sales on the broader market.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- A day after signaling that he had no immediate plans to take further steps to prop up the economy, the Federal Reserve chairman said Thursday that he was prepared to do so if the outlook worsened.
The chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, who had described the nation's economic outlook as "unusually uncertain" in presenting the Fed's semiannual monetary policy report to Congress on Wednesday, was somewhat more explicit about his thinking in the second day of testimony.
"We are ready, and we will act if the economy does not continue to improve, if we don't see the kind of improvements in the labor market that we are hoping for and expecting," Mr. Bernanke told Representative Melvin L. Watt, Democrat of North Carolina, at a hearing of the House Financial Services Committee.
"We have certainly utilized our principal tools, our most obvious conventional tools, anyway," Mr. Bernanke added. "And so we would have to step into new areas. I do believe that there are things we could do, and we are considering all options."
Mr. Bernanke, who called unemployment "the most important problem we have right now," offered additional details in evaluating the steps the Fed could take, having exhausted the usual tools of monetary policy.
The Fed has held its benchmark short-term interest rate at a record low, a range of zero to 0.25 percent, since the end of 2008, and has been saying the rate would stay there for "an extended period."
Mr. Bernanke said the Fed could alter that language to communicate "our intentions about future policy ease or future policy action, perhaps in a context of some conditionality or a framework that will help clarify our willingness to maintain policy support for the economy."
Many economists do not expect the Fed to begin to tighten monetary policy until next year at the earliest. By altering the "extended period" language, the Fed could potentially lengthen that time horizon even further, damping inflation expectations.
Mr. Bernanke also said that the Fed could lower the interest rates it pays on excess reserves, the funds banks keep at the Fed above what they are required to -- currently about $1 trillion. Congress only authorized the Fed to start paying such interest in 2008, during the financial crisis; the rate is currently 0.25 percent.
Representative Gary Peters, Democrat of Michigan, asked Mr. Bernanke why the Fed did not immediately cut the rate to zero, which would increase the sum the Fed turns over to the Treasury each year and also potentially spur banks to lend.
Mr. Bernanke said that step "certainly is an option," but said the rate was set at 0.25 percent largely for "a technical reason": propping up short-term money markets, like the federal funds market that banks use to lend money to each other overnight.
A third option is to further expand the Fed's balance sheet, which nearly tripled as the Fed bought mortgage bonds and government debt to put downward pressure on long-term rates.
But Republican lawmakers, in particular, were skeptical about any further actions by the Fed.
Representative Randy Neugebauer, Republican of Texas, asked: "At what point in time do we say, maybe the marketplace just has to work itself through this, and that the Fed and the federal government need to just kind of be still for a while and let normal market forces come into play?"
Mr. Bernanke replied: "We're not interfering with market forces. We're just trying to provide some support through accommodative financial conditions, to give the private sector the opportunity to invest and grow."
Other lawmakers, mostly Democrats, pleaded with the Fed to do more.
"We have not moved as aggressively, as passionately, on the unemployment and the jobs situation during this downturn as we have on Wall Street and bailing out these companies," said Representative David Scott, Democrat of Georgia.
Mr. Bernanke told him: "I would respectfully disagree that we haven't been doing anything or have not been urgent. We have pushed monetary stimulation to the highest point in American history. We have zero interest rates. We have tripled our balance sheet."
The lack of consensus about what the Fed should do next was echoed by economists.
Richard C. Koo, chief economist at the Nomura Research Institute in Tokyo, told the committee that monetary policy was of limited help in recessions that follow the bursting of debt-financed asset bubbles.
Companies are paying down debts rather than trying to make profits, he said, and stimulus spending by governments remains essential.
"With disappearing borrowers and reluctant lenders, it is no wonder that, after nearly two years of zero interest rates and massive liquidity injections, industrial production is still at the level of 2004, and the unemployment rate is almost in double digits," he said.
Allan H. Meltzer, an economist at Carnegie Mellon University and the leading historian of the Fed, sided with Republicans who said that uncertainty -- compounded by government indebtedness -- was the greatest constraint on economic growth.
"We do not need more monetary stimulus," Mr. Meltzer testified. "We need programs that get the banks to increase lending and businesses and consumers to increase spending. Reducing uncertainty and restoring confidence is the place to start."
Fed Official to Retire
William L. Rutledge, the head of bank supervision at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York since 1999, announced Thursday that he would retire at the end of this year.
The Fed's Board of Governors has been moving to revamp how it regulates institutions. Much of that oversight is conducted by the 12 Fed district banks, and the New York Fed was criticized for failing to adequately oversee banks like Citigroup before the 2008 financial crisis.
The regulatory overhaul signed into law by President Obama on Wednesday gives the Fed new authority over the financial system. Mr. Rutledge called the law an "important milestone."

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The chairman of the Federal Reserve, in saying that it had no immediate plans to provide additional support to the economy, dashed the hopes of some economists and executives who have been pushing for action to add momentum to the sluggish recovery.
The chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said Wednesday that the recovery was continuing at a modest pace, though with a "somewhat weaker outlook."
He projected that the unemployment rate would remain well above 7 percent through the end of 2012, and the duration of President Obama's current term. That, too, was a discouraging note to Washington incumbents facing tough re-election fights.
Mr. Bernanke's statement that the Fed had no imminent plans to go beyond its current strategy of keeping short-term interest rates exceptionally low pushed stock prices down. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 1.07 percent, or 109.43 points, to close at 10,120.53.
In presenting the Fed's semiannual monetary policy report to Congress, Mr. Bernanke said that it would take "a significant amount of time" to restore the 8.5 million jobs lost in the United States in 2008 and 2009, and that "the economic outlook remains unusually uncertain."
He also warned that financial conditions, particularly the European debt crisis, had "become less supportive of economic growth in recent months."
Testifying before the Senate Banking Committee, Mr. Bernanke for the first time publicly discussed additional monetary policy tools the Fed could use to prop up the economy, having lowered short-term interest rates as far as they can go and purchased nearly $2 trillion in mortgage-backed securities and Treasury debts to push long-term rates down.
First, he said, the Fed could signal to the markets that it intended to keep its benchmark federal funds rate, the rate at which banks lend to one another overnight, at zero to 0.25 percent for even longer than the "extended period" the Fed has been projecting.
Second, the Fed could lower the interest rate it pays on excess reserves, the deposits that banks keep at the Fed in excess of what they are required to keep, from its current level of 0.25 percent.
Third -- and the mostly widely discussed option -- the Fed could again expand the size of its balance sheet, which stands at about $2.3 trillion, by buying additional Treasury debts or mortgage-backed securities, or even other classes of assets, like municipal bonds.
On a smaller scale, the Fed could also reinvest the cash it received when the underlying principal on mortgage bonds on its books was repaid, a step that would also keep the Fed's balance sheet from shrinking.
"We have not come to the point where we can tell you precisely what the leading options are," Mr. Bernanke told Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, the top Republican on the Banking Committee.
"Clearly, each of these options has got drawbacks, potential costs. So we're going to continue to monitor the economy closely and continue to evaluate the alternatives that we have, recognizing, as I said, that policy is already quite stimulative."
When Mr. Shelby asked whether the Fed was "running out of options," Mr. Bernanke replied, "I think we do still have options, but they're not going to be the conventional options."
Mr. Bernanke told Senator Jim Bunning, Republican of Kentucky, that the Fed had no plans to take those actions "in the near term," but added, "I do think that there is some potential for some of those steps to be effective, and we'll continue to look at them."
Minutes from the June meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's main policy-making arm, indicated that a few officials had a new worry: deflation. Those officials believe that inflation -- which is running at about half the Fed's desired range of 1.7 to 2 percent -- has been so low that it could turn into a dangerous spiral of falling prices like the one that has plagued Japan since the mid-1990s.
"Forecasts are very uncertain, but I don't view deflation as a near-term risk for the United States," Mr. Bernanke told Mr. Shelby, noting that inflation expectations had remained stable.
"I think the Federal Reserve does have the capacity, the tools, should deflation occur -- which, again, I don't believe is very likely -- to reverse it, and we would be very assiduous in doing that," the chairman added. "I don't consider that to be a very high risk at this point."
Mr. Bernanke's testimony took a more cautious tone than he did in February.
The chairman noted weakness in the housing market, "with the overhang of vacant or foreclosed houses weighing on home prices and construction."
He called the slow recovery of the job market "an important drag on household spending." And he noted that the growth in private payrolls -- about 100,000 jobs a month in the first half of the year -- was "insufficient to reduce the unemployment rate materially."
The Fed expects the economy to grow this year by 3 to 3.5 percent, picking up only slightly, to 3.5 to 4.5 percent, in 2011 and 2012. The unemployment rate is projected to drop to 7 to 7.5 percent by the end of 2012 -- still far higher than the 5 to 5.3 percent that the Fed now considers to be full employment.
Mr. Bernanke said of the committee's last meeting: "Most participants viewed uncertainty about the outlook for growth and unemployment as greater than normal, and the majority saw the risks to growth as weighted to the downside."
Hours before his testimony, Mr. Bernanke had looked on as President Obama signed into law a far-reaching overhaul of the financial regulatory architecture.
In his appearance before the senators, he said the new law, along with tougher standards for bank capital and liquidity now being developed by international regulators, "will place our financial system on a sounder foundation and minimize the risk of a repetition of the devastating events of the past three years."
As has become common, senators of both parties pressed Mr. Bernanke to weigh in on the fiscal questions that have bitterly divided Congress. Mr. Bernanke held to his view that additional small-scale fiscal stimulus could be beneficial to the economy now, if combined with medium-term measures to rein in the high deficits.
"I would be reluctant to withdraw that support too precipitously in the near term," Mr. Bernanke told the committee's chairman, Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut. "At the same time, to maintain confidence and keep interest rates low, it's important that we have a strong and credible plan to reduce deficits over the coming years."

Full text: WASHINGTON -- With unemployment high and inflation low, a question is being asked more often and more loudly: Can and should the Federal Reserve do more to get the economy moving?
In two days of Congressional testimony that begin on Wednesday afternoon, Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, is likely to answer yes, but not just yet.
Mr. Bernanke's view is that the economic recovery is continuing, though at a modest clip, and that recent developments -- the stock market's swoon, Europe's financial turmoil and weak job creation -- are discouraging but do not yet justify additional monetary stimulus.
Mr. Bernanke says he believes that there are situations that could justify new measures on top of what the Fed has done so far: keeping short-term interest rates to near-record lows and amassing a portfolio of government bonds and mortgage-backed securities, which has put downward pressure on long-term rates.
But to take new action, Mr. Bernanke and other Fed officials would have to be convinced that the economy was moving onto a perilous path of deflation, or that the recovery was so painfully sluggish that it lacked enough momentum to generate private sector job growth.
Some economists are urging the Fed to resume purchases of mortgage bonds or Treasury securities, or even buy new categories of assets, which could have the effect of further lowering long-term interest rates.
So far, the debate within the Fed has occurred largely outside of public view, but it reflects how the economic picture has darkened from just a few months ago, when the prospects for a gradually improving economy and a robust stock market seemed more hopeful. Back then, the dominant talk was when to start tightening monetary policy and selling assets on the Fed's balance sheet.
"Now there is a general recognition that that talk was premature," said Peter N. Ireland, a professor of economics at Boston College and a former economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond.
Though far from a consensus, a growing number of experts seem to be in favor of additional easing of the supply of credit, given that interest rates the central bank directly controls can go no lower.
"The unemployment rate is so high, and there is such misallocation of labor in the economy, that the Fed should be willing to experiment with stuff that is pretty risky and untested," said Peter J. Klenow, a professor of economics at Stanford and a former economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis.
Karen E. Dynan, a former Fed economist who is now co-director of economic studies at the Brookings Institution, said that new data on retail sales, consumer confidence and housing starts were all discouraging.
"Recent indicators suggest a loss of momentum, and suggest that the recovery is not on a firm footing," she said. "All of this has increased pressure on the Fed to do more."
Mr. Ireland said it was imperative that the Fed consider additional measures as part of its "contingency planning" for a further weakening of the recovery.
"There has to be a discussion about whether asset purchases should be resumed if we move into the late summer, and especially into the fall, and we're seeing a bounce in the unemployment rate and further declines in spending," he said, while cautioning that he still did not believe such steps were needed.
But all three of those economists agreed that new asset purchases would entail risk.
Professor Klenow noted that buying longer-term Treasury debt might not have much effect on long-term interest rates, because government securities were very liquid.
The Fed might instead consider buying corporate bonds, or assets backed by consumer loans. Doing so could spur the willingness of private investors to lend, Professor Klenow said, but it might not help small businesses, the sector of the economy that needs loans the most. And it would surely spur criticism by economists and others who are fearful about the Fed making decisions to allocate credit by favoring some sectors over others.
In addition, although core inflation, which excludes the highly volatile prices of food and energy, has been running at about half of the Fed's target of nearly 2 percent, inflation expectations "have not come down nearly as much as one would expect, given how much slack there is in the economy," Ms. Dynan said.
The size of the Fed's balance sheet, which has more than doubled since the financial crisis of 2008, and the large amount of bank reserves sitting at the Fed has made officials at the central bank nervous about the potential for rapid inflation once banks decide to start lending more vigorously again, she noted.
"Their caution about deploying more expansionary measures has been warranted, but they need to be watching economic conditions very carefully," Ms. Dynan said.
A speech Mr. Bernanke gave in 2002, shortly after he left a professorship at Princeton to join the Fed's board of governors, has been widely cited of late. In it, Mr. Bernanke argued that a determined central bank could always reverse deflation, and generate inflation, through its control of the money supply.
But generating inflation is not the same thing as putting people back to work, a goal that the Fed's monetary toolbox seems less equipped to meet.
Long-term interest rates are already quite low. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note has fallen below 3 percent, and the average yield for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has hovered around 4.5 percent. With the cost of borrowing so low, the Fed might have reached the point of diminishing returns in its capacity to lower rates further.
Furthermore, if the Fed were to suddenly announce a big new program of asset purchases, it could cause inflation expectations to jump. That could raise nominal interest rates and lead to a rise in the price of oil as investors use commodities to hedge against inflation. In such a worst-case situation, the recession could become even worse.
Mr. Bernanke has been known to recite the first precept of the Hippocratic Oath: do no harm. Those familiar with his thinking compare additional monetary easing to a powerful but experimental drug whose side effects are not fully known.
So for now the Fed is very much in the role of the anxious doctor, waiting to see if the patient can recover on his own without an additional dose of untested medicine.

Full text: Prices for consumer goods fell in June for the third consecutive month, mostly because of lower costs for gasoline, according to a government report released Friday.
The Consumer Price Index, which measures prices of a batch of common goods, declined 0.1 percent last month on a seasonally adjusted basis. Lower prices for gasoline, which showed a 4.5 percent decline, were a big factor for the decrease. The report, released by the Labor Department, is considered a benchmark measure of inflation.
Over the last 12 months, the index has risen 1.1 percent before seasonal adjustment.
The lower energy and food prices offset increases for other items. Prices for housing, clothing, used cars, medical care, tobacco and recreation all rose, the department said. That meant the so-called core price index, which strips out food and energy prices, was up 0.2 percent in June, the largest gain this year and above analysts' forecasts for a 0.1 percent rise.
The core number is up 0.9 percent in the last 12 months.
With the rates well below the Federal Reserve's unofficial target of nearly 2 percent, some economists have said that there is more risk of deflation in the United States, like that seen in the Japanese economy for about two decades.
The minutes of the Fed's June meeting indicated that policy makers were divided on whether the weak economy faced deflation.
According to minutes released Wednesday, the Fed took note of the lower trend in underlying inflation amid price declines in energy and other commodities, saying that inflation would probably remain subdued for some time.
The muted inflationary pressures have allowed the Fed to keep rates at 0 to 0.25 percent. The Fed said it would expect the levels to remain "exceptionally low" for an extended period because of stable inflation expectations.
The current levels are the lowest inflation rates in five decades, said Steve Weiting, United States economist for Citi.
"There is amazing little price change," he said. "The drag on consumer incomes of higher prices has diminished to a negligible level."
Some economists pointed to a greater risk of deflation over time. With the unemployment rate at 9.5 percent in June and the recovery showing signs of faltering, the risk of deflation over the next few years is now greater then before, said Paul Ashworth, a senior United States economist for Capital Economics.
"The reality is that prices and wages react with a considerable lag to shifts in output and employment," he said in a research note. "Accordingly, we would caution that the most recent rebound in core prices is no reason to declare victory over deflation. The threat will be with us for a number of years yet."
The government figures showed that higher clothing, used car, medical and tobacco prices, as well as the first increase in homeowners' rents in 10 months, pushed up the core.
"With the economy slowing, and commodity prices falling, the main risk on the price front remains that inflation will be too low, not too high," said Nigel Gault, the chief United States economist for IHS Global Insight.
Much of the inflationary pressure has receded amid weak demand. "We have enormous unused capacity in the economy," said Joshua Shapiro, the chief United States economist for MFR Inc.
Mr. Shapiro said he expected only modest increases in wages with a "painfully slow" recovery in the job market.
"Consumer spending growth will therefore be moderate at best," he said.

Full text: OTTAWA -- The Canadian government is expected to announce on Friday that it will buy 65 F-35 fighter jets from Lockheed Martin.
The announcement of a multibillion-dollar commitment by a foreign government would be a big boost for the jet program, which has been plagued with delays and substantial price increases. It is also being made without bids from other manufacturers.
But long before any announcement was imminent, the purchase became politically controversial in Canada. On Thursday, the Liberal Party said that it would oppose the purchase. An alliance of opposition parties could stall or block the deal.
"I'm not suggesting that this may not be the best fighter aircraft for the Canadian forces," said Ujjal Dosanjh, a Liberal member of Parliament responsible for defense issues. "But we don't know that without going through a process."
"It's nice to have the latest and the greatest, said Jack Harris of the New Democratic Party. "But do we need that to protect our country? We're not, as we were in the cold war, facing off against the Soviet military."
The offices of Stephen Harper, the prime minister, and Peter MacKay, the defense minister, did not respond to requests for comment.
Canada is one of eight countries that are helping the United States build the fighter, which will be less detectable by radar than older planes and versatile enough to attack ground targets. The Canadian government has announced that it will phase out its recently updated fleet of CF-18 jets beginning in 2017.
Kim M. Testa, a spokeswoman for Lockheed Martin, said that Canada would complete the procurement in 2014 and begin accepting delivery of the first F-35s two years later.
Canada is likely to pay at least $4 billion for the planes, and one factor that may determine the political fate of the deal is Lockheed's willingness to buy parts from Canadian suppliers.
Ms. Testa said that Lockheed would buy about $10 billion of components and parts from Canadian aerospace companies as part of the deal. That is in line with Canada's usual demand that foreign companies spend about $2 in Canada for every dollar they receive through government contracts.
Other nations have also debated the necessity of an aircraft as costly and sophisticated as the F-35. Opposition leaders in Denmark and the Netherlands are questioning whether they can afford to buy such a plane at a time when their economies are under pressure. Lockheed, however, needs to hold onto the foreign sales to lower the cost of the planes.
The American defense secretary, Robert M. Gates, recently revamped the F-35 program and removed the general in charge, after the Pentagon's projected costs soared by 64 percent to $382 billion for 2,457 planes. The eight allies have invested a total of $4 billion in developing the plane and could buy hundreds of the planes through specific orders, most of which remain to be negotiated.
But Lockheed Martin's chief executive, Robert J. Stevens, said in June that the company was cutting its costs and improving the efficiency of its production.
Though recent Pentagon estimates have placed the cost of a single F-35 as high as $112 million, Mr. Stevens said Lockheed believed it could lower the cost, by 2014 or 2015, to be comparable to updated and fully loaded versions of older fighters, like Boeing's F/A-18 and Lockheed's own F-16. That would reduce the price of each F-35 to about $65 million.
Ms. Testa, the Lockheed Martin spokeswoman, said that the final price would be determined through negotiations between Canada and the United States. But she said Lockheed expected to sell planes for around that price or a little more. That could amount to about $4.2 billion to $4.5 billion for the 65 planes, not accounting for inflation, maintenance or parts.
Politicians in Canada have repeatedly cited estimates from the Canadian news media ranging from 9 billion Canadian dollars ($8.7 billion) for the basic contract and up to 16 billion Canadian dollars ($15.5 billion) when service costs are included.
While Canada did not call for tenders, Boeing has been lobbying the Canadian government and opposition politicians to consider the F/A-18, an update of the aircraft that is the basis of the government's current CF-18s. And a consortium of European manufacturers has been promoting the Eurofighter Typhoon.
The Canadian military has been remarkably absent from the public debate. While it is believed that its leadership is not opposed to the government's plan to buy new aircraft, there are indications that some have concerns about the F-35.
Canada's air force rarely flies combat missions, arguably making some of the F-35's advanced features, like radar-evading stealth, seem like frills.
Unlike the twin-engine CF-18, the F-35 has only one engine. Its failure could leave pilots exposed to the harsh Arctic environment as they await rescue.

Abstract: Hours before the Senate approved a far-reaching overhaul of Wall Street regulations on Thursday, President Obama's three nominees to the board of the Federal Reserve said they were prepared to help the central bank handle its vastly expanded duties to ensure financial stability and oversee financial institutions. The three nominees all expressed concern about the high unemployment rate, but did not weigh in on a debate within the Fed over whether the central bank -- having lowered interest rates nearly to zero and made trillions of dollars in loans and asset purchases -- could do more to stimulate the economy.

"We must work together, and in cooperation with central banks and governments around the world, to mitigate systemic risk in the financial and payments systems so that our country never again suffers such a devastating episode of financial instability," Janet L. Yellen, the nominee for vice chairwoman of the Fed, testified to the Senate banking committee.
If Ms. Yellen and the two other nominees are confirmed, which appears increasingly likely, they would provide the Fed with its first full complement on the board of governors since 2006. The appointments come at a time when the Fed's traditional mandate -- keeping inflation low and stable while promoting employment -- is being enlarged to include financial stability and oversight for all "systemically important" financial institutions, not just big banks.
The paradox that the Fed, after failing to rein in the subprime lending boom, is getting broad new powers was not lost on Ms. Yellen, who was on the Fed's board from 1994 to 1997 and has been president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco since 2004. Under questioning, she was blunt in admitting the central bank's shortcomings.
"We failed completely to understand the complexity of what the impact of the decline -- the national decline -- in housing prices would be in the financial system," she told Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee. "We saw a number of different things and we failed to connect the dots. We failed to understand just how seriously the mortgage standards, the underwriting standards, had declined, what had happened with the complexity of securitization and the risks that were building in the financial system around that."
Only part of the hearing focused on monetary economics, the Fed's traditional bailiwick. The three nominees all expressed concern about the high unemployment rate, but did not weigh in on a debate within the Fed over whether the central bank -- having lowered interest rates nearly to zero and made trillions of dollars in loans and asset purchases -- could do more to stimulate the economy.
"With unemployment still painfully high, job creation must be a high priority of monetary policy," Ms. Yellen said.
The second nominee, Sarah Bloom Raskin, who is the Maryland state banking regulator, noted the "pervasive social costs" of joblessness. She said the Fed's success in the last 30 years in curbing inflation was "only a partial victory when many American households continue to face the perils of unemployment and many small businesses struggle with weakened consumer demand and reduced access to credit."
The third nominee, Peter A. Diamond, an economics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, taught Ben S. Bernanke, now the Fed chairman, when Mr. Bernanke was a graduate student there. "A central theme of my research career has been how the economy deals with risks, both risks at the individual level and risks that affect the entire economy," Mr. Diamond said.
The confirmation hearing was sparsely attended by the senators: the committee chairman, Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, and the committee's top Republican, Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, both had to leave to vote on the regulatory legislation.
Mr. Dodd noted the surprising turnaround in the Fed's status since he released draft legislation last year in response to the financial crisis. "To be very blunt, that draft bill contemplated removing all of the Fed's authority in areas where it had performed poorly, leaving it with responsibility primarily over monetary policy," he told the nominees. "However, as we worked through the legislative process, it became clear that the political will of the Congress was to retain and strengthen the Fed's supervisory role."
Mr. Diamond acknowledged the challenge, saying, "The Fed will have major work to do to implement the tasks that the legislation is placing at the Fed."
The nominees received only a few tough questions, from Republican senators.
Mr. Shelby asked Ms. Yellen about the failures of about 65 banks, with estimated loss of $28 billion, since 2004 in the San Francisco Fed district.
Ms. Yellen said that "our regulatory oversight was careful and appropriate," but noted that most of the failed institutions were community banks with high exposure to commercial real estate. More broadly, she said, "The regulatory response was insufficient over a period of years."
She added: "There is a need for all of us in regulation to act in a timely way, to take away the punch bowl, and to require more stringent capital requirements."
Ms. Raskin, who was a staff lawyer for the Senate banking committee under a former chairman, Paul S. Sarbanes, said that regulators did not devote enough attention to the importance of capital and of banks' off-balance-sheet assets leading up to the crisis.
"For those of us on the ground level, we saw quite a number of disturbing trends in housing markets," including the sometimes weak regulation of mortgage originations, she said.
Mr. Shelby, who noted that Mr. Diamond had once described himself as a "card-carrying behavioral economist," elicited a response that suggested that personal financial literacy would continue to be a focus for Mr. Diamond, who is an authority on Social Security and pensions.
"Behavioral economics draws heavily on cognitive psychology, and cognitive psychology is very aware of the difficulty for inexperienced people in interpreting complicated elements," he said.

Full text: WASHINGTON (AP) -- New evidence of a slowing economic rebound emerged Thursday in reports that manufacturing activity was slowing after helping push the early stages of the recovery.
Factory output fell in June, according to a government report on industrial production. It was the sharpest monthly drop in a year. And two regional manufacturing indexes sank this month.
Production of automobiles, home-building materials and processed food all fell in June. The data sent stocks falling.
Federal Reserve officials took note of the weakening recovery when they met last month and lowered their forecast for economic growth, according to minutes released Wednesday.
Manufacturing helped the economy start to recover last year and has since been one of the strongest sectors. June's decline in output was the first in four months. Overall industrial production ticked up for the month, but that was mainly the result of hot weather that increased demand for electricity from utilities.
"Today's report supports the view that the manufacturing recovery lost some momentum," said Peter Newland of Barclays Capital Research.
The decline in factory output came as new data offered a mixed picture of the recovery. Applications for unemployment benefits fell to 429,000, the lowest level since August 2008, the Labor Department said Thursday. But much of that was the result of seasonal factors like manufacturers skipping their usual summer shutdowns.
Separately, the Labor Department said wholesale prices fell for a third month. Prices were pulled down by a drop in energy costs and the biggest decline in food costs in eight years. But excluding those two volatile commodities, inflation was nearly flat.
The Federal Reserve report on industrial production showed that overall output at the nation's factories, mines and utilities rose 0.1 percent in June. It was the fourth consecutive monthly gain. But factory output -- the largest component of industrial production -- dropped 0.4 percent.
Adding to concerns in the manufacturing sector were steep drops reported Thursday in the Empire State and Philadelphia Fed manufacturing indexes.
Economists viewed the reduction in factory output as further evidence that the economy was weakening as it entered the second half of this year.
"It is pretty clear that a slowdown is in process," said Brian Bethune, chief United States financial economist for IHS Global Insight. "The healing process from a severe recession is still under way. But given the kind of trauma the economy was subjected to, it isn't going to bounce back on a sustained basis right away."
The latest data on jobless claims looked promising on the surface, as initial claims fell by 29,000. But much of that was the result of seasonal factors. A Labor Department analyst said manufacturing companies reported fewer temporary layoffs than usual this time of year. General Motors said last month that it would forgo its customary two-week summer factory closings, which it uses to retool plants for new car models.
That usually causes a spike in temporary layoffs and jobless claims in early July. Other manufacturers also reported fewer temporary layoffs than expected, the analyst added.
Last week's drop in initial claims "is very encouraging," Jennifer Lee, an economist at BMO Capital Markets, said in a note to clients. "But it likely won't last" because much of it resulted from seasonal factors.
Claims had been stuck above 450,000 all year, after dropping steadily last year from a peak of 651,000 in March 2009. In a healthy economic recovery with rapid hiring, claims usually fall below 400,000.
Before seasonal adjustment, the number of jobless claims rose last week. But since they did not rise as much as they usually do this time of year, the seasonally adjusted number fell.

Abstract: The central bank has already held interest rates lower for longer than at any time since the Great Depression, keeping the benchmark short-term interest rate near zero since December 2008. Since the start of the financial crisis, the Fed has more than doubled its balance sheet, to $2.3 trillion, by buying mortgage bonds and Treasury debt to keep long-term interest rates low.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve disclosed on Wednesday that its chief policy makers were divided on whether the weak economy faced a new, potentially dangerous threat in the form of deflation.
The dissent within the Fed emerged as the White House released a report estimating that its economic stimulus program had saved or created 2.5 million to 3.6 million jobs since it was enacted, over nearly unanimous Republican opposition, at the start of President Obama's term.
The estimates in the report were in line with those of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and independent experts. But Senate Republicans, who have blocked legislation to extend unemployment benefits, continued to portray the administration as fiscally reckless and the stimulus as ineffective.
"I know what they're against, but I don't know what they're for," Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. said of the Republicans as he unveiled the report. "I mean that literally."
With Congress deadlocked over fiscal policy, attention has shifted to monetary policy as a tool for attacking the 9.5 percent unemployment rate. But on that score, the Fed is also divided, though its disagreements are expressed in a far more genteel manner.
On Wednesday, the Fed lowered its estimate of economic growth for this year, to a range of 3 to 3.5 percent, from the 3.2 percent to 3.7 percent forecast in April. Inflation has been running well below the Fed's unofficial target of nearly 2 percent, so much so that a few officials fear that the United States is at risk of the kind of deflationary spiral that has hobbled the Japanese economy for the better part of two decades.
The Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, has not embraced that view, but even those who disagree with it say the Fed, whose modern institutional culture was built around fighting inflation, now confronts a distinctly different problem of high joblessness.
"If federal fiscal policy is approaching its political or economic limits, some believe that the Federal Reserve should do more, including expansion of its balance sheet," Kevin M. Warsh, a Fed governor who is close to Mr. Bernanke, said in a recent speech to the Atlanta Rotary Club. "In my view, any judgment to expand the balance sheet further," by acquiring mortgage bonds and debt, "should be subject to strict scrutiny."
The central bank has already held interest rates lower for longer than at any time since the Great Depression, keeping the benchmark short-term interest rate near zero since December 2008. Since the start of the financial crisis, the Fed has more than doubled its balance sheet, to $2.3 trillion, by buying mortgage bonds and Treasury debt to keep long-term interest rates low.
But, as Mr. Bernanke pointed out in a speech in 2002, when he was a Fed governor, a central bank that has run out of ordinary tools to prop up the economy, like lowering short-term interest rates, still has other options to prevent deflation.
By resuming its purchases of assets or by being more explicit about its intentions to keep interest rates low, the Fed could lower inflation expectations and long-term interest rates. That could further stimulate borrowing and spending by companies and individuals.
The minutes released Wednesday from the June 22-23 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's crucial policy body, cited the threat of deflation in the United States for the first time in a year.
"A few participants cited some risk of deflation," the minutes noted. "Other participants, however, thought that inflation was unlikely to fall appreciably further, given the stability of inflation expectations in recent years and very accommodative monetary policy."
The minutes, which are carefully worded to avoid the appearance of discord, nonetheless made clear a growing divergence in views.
"Several participants noted that a continuation of lower-than-expected inflation and high unemployment could eventually lead to a downward movement in inflation expectations that would reinforce disinflationary pressure," the minutes stated. "By contrast, a few participants noted the possibility that a potentially unsustainable fiscal position and the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet could boost inflation expectations and actual inflation over time."
The direction of monetary policy will probably be raised at a hearing on Thursday, at which the Senate Banking Committee will take up the nominations of Janet L. Yellen, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco; Peter A. Diamond, an economist; and Sarah Bloom Raskin, a banking regulator, to seats on the Fed's seven-member board of governors.
While the Fed debate continues, the White House is combating skepticism over the $787 billion stimulus program.
In the latest CBSNews poll, almost three-quarters of Americans said the stimulus had not improved the economy. A new poll by The Washington Post and ABC also found that more than half of respondents said the government should not provide additional stimulus.
"More debt only subtracts capital from the private markets that could be used for loans, to hire more people and create more jobs," Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, the chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, said in an interview.
He said the administration's proposals on health care, regulation, energy and trade had discouraged private sector growth.
To shore up support for the stimulus program, the White House has been promoting what Mr. Biden has called the "summer of recovery."
The new report, by the Council of Economic Advisers, showed that the pace of fiscal stimulus had accelerated, with spending growing to $116 billion in the second quarter, from $108 billion in the first quarter and $80 billion in the final three months of 2009.
The report also estimated that gross domestic product, a measure of overall economic output, was 2.7 to 3.2 percent higher than it would have been without the stimulus.
"I am absolutely confident we are moving in the right direction, absolutely confident," Mr. Biden said. He said federal money had been used to stimulate emerging industries like clean energy.
"None of this would have been possible if our friends on the other side -- as my mother would say, God love them -- our friends on the other side had gotten their way," Mr. Biden said.
The report used historical data and statistical modeling to arrive at the estimate of jobs saved or created, but Christina D. Romer, chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers, acknowledged that there was some uncertainty over the job estimates, which rely on reporting from recipients of federal aid.
"I suspect the true effects of the act will not be fully analyzed or fully appreciated for many years," she said, adding that most experts agreed that the stimulus had had a "significant, beneficial impact on employment and output over the past year."
Mr. Biden acknowledged public frustration over the economy, but noted that the crisis predated the administration. "Before we walked in the West Wing, we were handed a deficit, a bill for that year, for over $1 trillion," he said.
Real G.D.P. started growing in the second half of last year, and private sector payrolls have increased by nearly 600,000 since their low point in December. But that has been barely enough to keep pace with the normal rate of growth of the work force.

Abstract: Like other economists, myself included, Mr. Bernanke was deeply disturbed by Japan's stubborn, seemingly incurable deflation, which in turn was "associated with years of painfully slow growth, rising joblessness, and apparently intractable financial problems." Conventional monetary policy, in which the Fed drives down short-term interest rates by buying short-term U.S. government debt, has reached its limit: those short-term rates are already near zero, and can't go significantly lower.

Full text: Back in 2002, a professor turned Federal Reserve official by the name of Ben Bernanke gave a widely quoted speech titled "Deflation: Making Sure 'It' Doesn't Happen Here." Like other economists, myself included, Mr. Bernanke was deeply disturbed by Japan's stubborn, seemingly incurable deflation, which in turn was "associated with years of painfully slow growth, rising joblessness, and apparently intractable financial problems." This sort of thing wasn't supposed to happen to an advanced nation with sophisticated policy makers. Could something similar happen to the United States?
Not to worry, said Mr. Bernanke: the Fed had the tools required to head off an American version of the Japan syndrome, and it would use them if necessary.
Today, Mr. Bernanke is the Fed's chairman -- and his 2002 speech reads like famous last words. We aren't literally suffering deflation (yet). But inflation is far below the Fed's preferred rate of 1.7 to 2 percent, and trending steadily lower; it's a good bet that by some measures we'll be seeing deflation by sometime next year. Meanwhile, we already have painfully slow growth, very high joblessness, and intractable financial problems. And what is the Fed's response? It's debating -- with ponderous slowness -- whether maybe, possibly, it should consider trying to do something about the situation, one of these days.
The Fed's fecklessness is, to be sure, not unique. It has been astonishing and infuriating, as the economic crisis has unfolded, to watch America's political class defining normalcy down. As recently as two years ago, anyone predicting the current state of affairs (not only is unemployment disastrously high, but most forecasts say that it will stay very high for years) would have been dismissed as a crazy alarmist. Now that the nightmare has become reality, however -- and yes, it is a nightmare for millions of Americans -- Washington seems to feel absolutely no sense of urgency. Are hopes being destroyed, small businesses being driven into bankruptcy, lives being blighted? Never mind, let's talk about the evils of budget deficits.
Still, one might have hoped that the Fed would be different. For one thing, the Fed, unlike the Obama administration, retains considerable freedom of action. It doesn't need 60 votes in the Senate; the outer limits of its policies aren't determined by the views of senators from Nebraska and Maine. Beyond that, the Fed was supposed to be intellectually prepared for this situation. Mr. Bernanke has thought long and hard about how to avoid a Japanese-style economic trap, and the Fed's researchers have been obsessed for years with the same question.
But here we are, visibly sliding toward deflation -- and the Fed is standing pat.
What should it be doing? Conventional monetary policy, in which the Fed drives down short-term interest rates by buying short-term U.S. government debt, has reached its limit: those short-term rates are already near zero, and can't go significantly lower. (Investors won't buy bonds that yield negative interest, since they can always hoard cash instead.) But the message of Mr. Bernanke's 2002 speech was that there are other things the Fed can do. It can buy longer-term government debt. It can buy private-sector debt. It can try to move expectations by announcing that it will keep short-term rates low for a long time. It can raise its long-run inflation target, to help convince the private sector that borrowing is a good idea and hoarding cash a mistake.
Nobody knows how well any one of these actions would work. The point, however, is that there are things the Fed could and should be doing, but isn't. Why not?
After all, Fed officials, like most observers, have a fairly grim view of the economy's prospects. Not grim enough, in my view: Fed presidents, who make forecasts every time the committee that sets interest rates meets, aren't taking the trend toward deflation sufficiently seriously. Nonetheless, even their projections show high unemployment and below-target inflation persisting at least through late 2012.
So why not try to do something about it? The closest thing I've seen to an explanation is a recent speech by Kevin Warsh of the Fed's Board of Governors, in which he declared that doing what Mr. Bernanke recommended back in 2002 risked undermining the Fed's "institutional credibility." But how, exactly, does it serve the Fed's credibility when it fails to confront high unemployment, while consistently missing its own inflation targets? How credible is the Bank of Japan after presiding over 15 years of deflation?
Whatever is going on, the Fed needs to rethink its priorities, fast. Mr. Bernanke's "it" isn't a hypothetical possibility, it's on the verge of happening. And the Fed should be doing all it can to stop it.

Full text: No industry enjoys the array of tax breaks and subsidies that the oil and gas industry does. No industry needs them less. For all the damage it has caused, the disastrous oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico may provide the political momentum to end this special treatment.
President Obama's 2011 budget, proposed before the spill, would eliminate $4 billion in annual tax breaks for oil and gas companies. Bills in both houses introduced after the spill would achieve many of the same results. Industry has spent $340 million on lobbying over the last two years to block these sorts of initiatives, and until recently Congress has been eager to do its bidding. This year could be different.
The White House has proposed eliminating nine tax breaks. Some are modest, all are complicated, but in toto they provide a range of cushy benefits -- fast write-offs for upfront drilling expenses, generous depletion allowances, and the like -- that are available at virtually every stage of the exploration and production process.
The net result, as The Times reported recently, is an effective tax rate on investment far lower than that paid by other industries. That, the Treasury Department argues, has encouraged overinvestment in oil and gas drilling at the expense of other parts of the economy.
Industry argues that these and other breaks are vital to robust domestic production and that both investment and employment would fall if they were eliminated. These arguments, which may have made sense years ago, are much less compelling when oil prices are hovering near $80 a barrel and oil companies -- including BP -- have been racking up huge profits.
Moreover, a Treasury Department analysis says that ending these breaks would reduce domestic production by less than 1 percent. A separate study by Congress's Joint Economic Committee says that ending the biggest of the deductions -- 9 percent of qualified income from gas and oil produced in the United States -- would have zero effect on consumer prices.
Apart from these benefits, two other areas cry out for reform. One is the royalty relief program, enacted by Congress in 1995 to encourage the kind of deepwater drilling that has now landed the gulf, its wildlife and its neighboring citizens in so much trouble. Royalty rates are currently 12.5 percent of the per-barrel price for onshore leases, and up to 18.75 percent offshore.
The law suspended royalties as long as oil remained below a threshold price of $28 a barrel. Prices have long since exceeded that threshold, even adjusted for inflation; and because the law was not tightly written, companies have been able to exploit its ambiguities to save themselves billions of dollars.
Sima Gandhi, a tax expert at the Center for American Progress, a liberal advocacy group, estimates that the losses from lost royalties could eventually exceed $80 billion unless Congress fixes the law. It is high time to review the entire royalty relief program, which at current prices is surely outdated and may be unnecessary.
The administration also needs to look carefully at the oil industry's use of tax havens abroad. The Senate Finance Committee has already announced that it will examine whether Transocean, the operator of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig, exploited tax laws when it moved its headquarters first to the Cayman Islands, then to Switzerland. Other oil companies also have foreign subsidiaries; the question is whether and to what extent they use them to dodge taxes. The Times article reported that Transocean alone had saved $1.8 billion in taxes since moving overseas in 1999.
Instead of enriching the oil companies, Congress should end these unjustifiable breaks and focus on encouraging alternative fuel sources that create cleaner energy and new clean-energy jobs.

Abstract: E.T.F.'s don't do that, so they're changing the investment focus. Because they own shares of companies, not just land and trees, E.T.F.'s are making bets on all timber-related sectors of the economy -- everything from papermaking to homebuilding.

Full text: FOR decades, some university endowments, pension funds and other big investors have put part of their money to work in the woods. They've bought large tracts of timberland, viewing them as an asset class separate from stocks, bonds and other forms of real estate.
Jeremy Grantham, co-founder and chief investment strategist at GMO, the asset manager based in Boston, calls timber "a perfect investment" for someone with a time horizon of, say, 20 years or more. "Timber is safer than stocks but not quite as safe as Treasury inflation-protected bonds," he said. "And as long as the sun shines and the rain rains, trees grow."
Timber also acts as an inflation hedge. "If you look at commodities, you find a pattern that all of them, except timber, had a declining real price up until 10 years ago," Mr. Grantham said. "But standing timber has a long-term record of modestly rising prices."
Retail investors, for the most part, haven't been able to exploit the investment benefits of timberland because acquiring it has demanded too much money and expertise. A typical swath of Georgia pine or Maine spruce could sell for millions of dollars, and buying it required knowledge that couldn't be gleaned from typical investment books. A buyer had to understand land, lumber and even bugs, said Bob L. Izlar, director of the Center for Forest Business at the University of Georgia.
After all, an insect infestation can destroy a stand of trees just as surely as a financial crisis can bring down a bank.
"The mountain pine beetle has eaten 70 million acres of timber in Canada," Mr. Izlar said.
Lately, however, novices have been invited to play in the woods. Over the last three years, exchange-traded funds have been introduced that, in theory, provide easier access to the diversification benefits of timber. The Claymore/Beacon Global Timber Index E.T.F. and the iShares S.&P. Global Timber and Forestry Index fund buy securities like timber-related stocks and real estate investment trusts.
"The traditional timber market had very high barriers to entry," said Steven A. Baffico, head of United States retail distribution for Guggenheim Claymore. Besides being costly and hard to understand, it required that investors lock up their cash. Unloading timberland can take anywhere from six months to two years, Mr. Baffico said. And if you want to enjoy the full benefit of your investment, you may have to wait decades for trees to mature.
In contrast, an exchange-traded fund holding easy-to-trade stocks and REITs gives investors the ability to sell shares daily: it may lack larches and lodgepoles but compensates with convenience. Besides, companies in the Claymore/Beacon index, like Weyerhaeuser, often own ample acres themselves, Mr. Baffico said.
"Beacon measures the amount of timber ownership of the underlying companies," he added. "We want a good proxy for the timber industry at large."
Experts are divided over whether E.T.F.'s can replicate timberland closely enough to serve as a substitute investment.
Andrew W. Lo, a finance professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, likes the diversification that timberland investments bring: he said that the returns correlate less with, say, United States stocks than Western European stocks would. As a result, timberland might help to prop up the value of a portfolio during a bear market.
E.T.F.'s, by design, dilute that benefit, Professor Lo said. Someone like David F. Swensen, head of Yale's endowment and a pioneering timber investor, "is buying actual forests and getting direct exposure to the asset," he said. "E.T.F.'s don't do that, so they're changing the investment focus."
Because they own shares of companies, not just land and trees, E.T.F.'s are making bets on all timber-related sectors of the economy -- everything from papermaking to homebuilding. As a result, their long-term price performance could end up correlated more with stocks than with timberlands, Professor Lo said.
"The jury is still out on whether E.T.F.'s can provide the kind of exposure to timber that David Swensen can get for Yale," he said. "If they do, they could add value for investors."
J. Brian Fiacco, owner of Timberlands Strategies in Summerville, S.C., advises institutional investors on timber purchases, and has concluded that E.T.F.'s are not an accurate proxy for timberland. Too many of the companies that they hold no longer own much, if any, actual timber, he said. Consider International Paper, whose shares are owned by both iShares and Claymore Beacon. It sold the bulk of its timberland to focus on manufacturing, he said.
In addition to E.T.F.'s, investors can buy shares of timber REIT's. The United States has three -- Plum Creek, Potlatch and Rayonier -- and Weyerhaeuser is taking steps to become one. All four have substantial land holdings. For example, Plum Creek, based in Seattle, owns seven million acres in 19 states.
Although the REITs are closer to a timber pure play than the E.T.F.'s, they are still likely to be more correlated with Wall Street than with the woods, Mr. Fiacco said. So he is skeptical of using them to achieve diversification.
INSTEAD, he advocates the old-fashioned path of just buying timberland. That's more expensive and time-consuming than buying a security, but may not be out of reach for some affluent people. "You can own small tracts," he said. "I have 58 acres right outside of Charleston. I also own 150 acres in the northern Adirondacks."
Timberland brokers and appraisers can help with the identification and evaluation of properties, and buyers can pool their funds with other people to reduce their risk, he said. A group of friends might form a limited liability corporation and buy a few hundred, or even a few thousand, acres.
To be affordable, the land would probably have to be a long drive from, say, New York City or Boston -- perhaps in the Adirondacks or rural Maine, he said. And as the trees grow, the land could produce a modest flow of cash through a hunting lease.
"It's both possible and practical," Mr. Fiacco said. "Your timberlands don't have to be diversified. If you're a huge timberland investor, yes, the age and diversity of the trees and the region of the country -- all of that stuff matters. But the average investor, who already has a 401(k) and stocks and bonds, if they buy one tract of timberland, that's additional diversification."

Abstract: Greece, its debt downgraded to junk status, clung to solvency and was backstopped by an international rescue package. Because domestic yields have been so skimpy -- even negative for short- and medium-term Treasury securities when adjusted for inflation -- some specialists argue that this might still be a propitious time for American bond investors to look abroad.

Full text: AS 2010 began, the overwhelming consensus for bonds was that those holding them risked a hefty climb in interest rates. Another assumption was that the huge build-up in United States debt would push down the value of the dollar.
The results so far? Wrong on both counts. Rates have eased, and the dollar has strengthened.
"What was not predictable was the fear of contagion that emerged in Europe" prompted by the fiscal crisis in Greece, said Zane E. Brown, fixed-income strategist at Lord Abbett & Company.
This broad threat to growth also prompted a new, haven-seeking flight to the dollar.
These unexpected developments might suggest that the growing ranks of yield-starved American investors attracted to foreign bonds, typically through mutual funds, may be having second thoughts.
"Most of the funds in the category lost some ground" in the second quarter, said Miriam Sjoblom, a bond analyst at Morningstar. For many, she added, "it's the euro that's been dragging things down."
The group lost 0.35 percent in the second quarter, according to Morningstar, versus a first-quarter gain of 1.1 percent and a jump of 13.1 percent for all of 2009. Morningstar's world bond category of some 80 funds is highly diverse. Some hedge currencies; some include United States Treasury debt. But all share exposure to foreign fixed-income securities, and most of the portfolios hold a mix of sovereign and corporate debt.
Global bond funds can invest anywhere in the world; international funds exclude American securities. Either type might seem an especially difficult asset to evaluate. After all, investors must consider currency values as well as the direction of interest rates, not to mention the usual factors like manager skill, default risk and costs. Still, the vast investment landscape makes it relatively easy for managers to avoid problem areas and, as one put it, concentrate on the "low-hanging fruit."
Despite the bumpy spring in the market -- "a bit of a perfect storm," according to Michael Hasenstab, portfolio manager of the $33 billion Templeton Global Bond fund -- relatively few investors have bailed out.
World bond funds are on a pace this year to surpass the inflow of $23.55 billion of 2009, despite a recent slowing. For April and May, the inflow was $4.63 billion, compared with $13.07 billion in the first three months of the year, according to Morningstar.
EUROPE was the market's focal point this spring, Ms. Sjoblom observed, as budget and other economic woes weighed on interest rates and prompted a renewed stampede into the presumably safer dollar.
The value of the euro, the common currency of 16 nations, fell in the first half of the year, to $1.22 from $1.43, or 15 percent. And the euro's very survival came into question, with pessimists contending that a common currency could not long endure without the coordinating structure of a common fiscal authority.
During the second quarter, managers continued to shed debt of the most overborrowed countries, with Spain, Portugal and Italy coming under closer scrutiny. Greece, its debt downgraded to junk status, clung to solvency and was backstopped by an international rescue package.
Because domestic yields have been so skimpy -- even negative for short- and medium-term Treasury securities when adjusted for inflation -- some specialists argue that this might still be a propitious time for American bond investors to look abroad.
Global bonds are "still a very interesting asset class," said Kenneth M. Buntrock, a co-manager of the $2 billion Loomis Sayles Global Bond fund in Boston. Along with most other forecasters, he puts the chances of United States interest rates rising this year "at virtually zero."
Mr. Buntrock said his fund provides "a big diversification of currencies and sectors -- U.S., European and Asian investment-grade bonds, global high-yield and small exposure to asset-backed securities."
The combination of quality extremes tends to provide higher returns, adjusted for risk, than a middle-ground approach would. With an average portfolio quality of Aa-3, the fund has provided a substantial yield, of 3.8 percent in the 12 months through June.
Loomis Sayles Global boasted investment inflows through March, but "a little bit of outflow" during the second quarter, Mr. Buntrock said.
Bill Gross, the chief strategist at the bond giant Pimco, has recently modified his bearish outlook for United States Treasury bonds, moving essentially to neutral from underweight. Earlier fears that swelling deficits and government borrowing would drive rates higher have been mitigated to some extent by prospects for slower economic growth.
The global volatility of this past spring produced some enticing investment opportunities. Mr. Hasenstab says that despite the "huge head wind in Europe," the creation of the safety net for European borrowers has made government defaults unlikely.
And he notes that some countries, like Poland and Norway, have solid budgets. The debt of those two countries, along with that of South Korea, Sweden, Australia and two Australian states, make up the top holdings of his fund.
"U.S. growth will outperform European growth," Mr. Hasenstab says, adding that Asian growth outside of Japan "will outperform both Europe and the U.S." He suggests that most Asian currencies will appreciate against the dollar, euro and yen.
"We're not a believer in a global double-dip" recession, he added, noting that China has "lots of tools" to soften the blow if it appears to be overdoing efforts to curb unsustainable expansion.
Mr. Brown of Lord Abbett, citing substantial risk in United States Treasury bonds, said he had become somewhat encouraged about Europe, where "perhaps gradual austerity programs won't do quite as much damage to growth as feared."
Although his firm has no fund devoted specifically to foreign bonds, Mr. Brown monitors foreign corporate issues, which make up 10 percent to 15 percent of the Lord Abbett High Yield fund, and foreign currencies for its Developing Local Markets fund.
DESPITE huge gains in 2009, both foreign and domestic junk bonds still "offer some fantastic opportunities," Mr. Brown said. He added that corporate credits lend themselves to more reliable financial evaluation than do the political actions of governments.
Somewhat surprisingly, Mr. Brown also advised income-oriented investors seeking to diversify out of the dollar to favor stocks over bonds, which are often expensively hedged.
"They really ought to think of equities first and fixed-income second," he said.
Still, foreign bonds remain an expanding asset class, now a strategic rather than merely a tactical allocation for many investors. "It's now more important than ever to have a longer view and not to get caught up in quarter-to-quarter moves," Mr. Hasenstab says.

Full text: IN the depths of the financial crisis in 2008, many real estate, stock and corporate bond investments plummeted. Some investors were able to find refuge in bond funds that held Treasury securities. But there was another haven: funds that invest in mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association, or Ginnie Mae.
The 16 Ginnie Mae funds tracked by Morningstar returned an average of 3.35 percent in the second quarter and 8.47 percent in the 12 months through June. That comes after growth of about 6 percent last year, 6.6 percent in 2008 and 6.3 percent in 2007.
The Barclays Capital United States MBS Ginnie Mae Index, which tracks the market for the underlying securities in these funds, has produced positive returns every year since 1985, with the exception of 1994.
Eager for steady returns that yield more than Treasuries, investors poured a net $5.8 billion into the 16 funds in 2008 and an additional $10.4 billion in 2009. That influx reversed five consecutive years of net outflows from 2003 to 2007, according to Morningstar.
A big reason is that unlike Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which have only the implied backing of the federal government, Ginnie Mae has an explicit guarantee, which has given many investors comfort in difficult financial markets.
Yet unlike Treasuries, mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by all three of these agencies are exposed to many of the vagaries of the mortgage market, especially the risk that investors will refinance their mortgages. As compensation, bonds backed by these agencies typically yield at least 75 basis points, or 0.75 percentage points, more than 10-year Treasuries.
"After what we saw in 2008, there was a good deal of concern about the mortgage sector, but it was focused on Fannie and Freddie, not Ginnie Mae, and people often don't make that distinction," said Ronald Reardon, co-head of the mortgage and agency team at Vanguard. "You are earning a pretty good yield over Treasuries, which amounts to zero risk over Treasuries, and the fact that you're likely to earn that premium, that's the question people should think about."
The Federal Reserve's emergency operations during the financial crisis also provided a boost to Ginnie Mae funds. To stabilize the mortgage market, the central bank started buying mortgage-backed securities in late 2008, including some backed by Ginnie Mae. Through March, the central bank had soaked up about $1.25 trillion of the securities, helping to bolster demand and prices.
When the central bank starts selling its mortgage-backed securities, as it plans to do eventually, Ginnie Mae funds could be hurt. But most fund managers say they don't expect that to happen anytime soon.
"Yes, they do want to sell them," said Bill Irving, who manages the Fidelity GNMA fund. But, he added, "it'll be done over five years in an orderly way."
There is another, more traditional risk: significant moves in interest rates could affect the mortgages that are bundled into the securities held by Ginnie Mae funds.
The basic calculus is this: As mortgage rates fall, homeowners are more inclined to finance their homes at lower rates. When that happens, the lenders -- in this case, the mutual funds -- that hold the expiring mortgages get their principal back, but forgo the chance to earn higher interest. When fund managers use the proceeds to buy more mortgage-backed securities, they often yield less than the securities they replaced.
With interest rates near half-century lows, one might expect a surge in refinancing. But the credit crisis has forced banks to tighten their lending standards, making it harder for homeowners to refinance their mortgages -- another boost for investors in Ginnie Mae funds.
Interest rates, though, are not the only variable when evaluating the chance that homeowners will refinance their mortgages. Gary Madich, the chief investment officer for JPMorgan Asset Management's fixed-income team in Columbus, Ohio, also checks the credit profile, collateral, ZIP codes and other features of the mortgages that are bundled into securities. This bottom-up approach is time-consuming but can pay dividends.
"This translates into very specific securities, typically at deep discounts or premiums," Mr. Madich said. "When we feel like we have prepayment risk, we take great time at the security level to give us more stability. It is very different than managers who are just looking at coupons."
Either way, most Ginnie Mae funds yield only a few percentage points more than the inflation rate in most years. As a consequence, investors should look carefully at the fees that funds charge because they can wipe out much of a fund's net gains.
The Vanguard GNMA fund, with $37 billion in assets, is the largest Ginnie Mae fund, according to Morningstar. It has an expense ratio of 0.23 percent. The fund gained 3.43 percent in the second quarter and 8.3 percent in the 12 months through June. The Fidelity GNMA fund is the second largest, at $7.9 billion, and has an expense ratio of 0.45 percent. It gained 3.54 percent last quarter and 9.01 percent in the last 12 months.
The T. Rowe Price GNMA fund, with assets of almost $1.5 billion, has an expense ratio of 0.66 percent and gained 3.13 percent in the quarter and 8.31 percent in the last 12 months.
FINANCIAL advisers say that investors seeking stability may want to include GNMA's in a diversified portfolio, being careful to offset the risk of a big sell-off in mortgage-backed securities.
"I have some clients in Ginnie Maes and would continue to recommend them even in this unstable credit market," said Edward Wolpert, a fee-only financial planner in Decatur, Ga. "If there is a great need for stability of income, I'd recommend a mix of Treasuries, Ginnie Maes and corporate bonds rated A or higher."

Full text: HONG KONG -- Barring any surprises, interest rates in the United States and much of Europe look set to stay steady until next year. But in fast-growing Asia, the cost of borrowing has begun to creep up again.
South Korea on Friday became the latest country to raise interest rates from the lows of the financial crisis, joining a host of others in the region in gradually normalizing borrowing costs.
The increase was slight -- the benchmark seven-day repurchase rate was nudged up by a quarter of a percentage point, to 2.25 percent -- but the timing surprised many analysts, who had not expected the Bank of Korea to act until next month.
Less than 24 hours earlier, the central bank in Malaysia also staged a quarter-point rate rise -- its third this year -- again surprising observers, who had mostly forecast no further move for the time being. The overnight policy rate in Malaysia now stands at 2.75 percent.
And the previous Friday, India announced an unexpected rate increase, its third this year. Vietnam, Taiwan, New Zealand and Australia also have started to return rates toward more normal levels, in Australia's case with a string of increases that started last October.
Collectively, the moves are testimony to the region's economic strength.
The Asia-Pacific region was spared major banking failures, and its governments and households are far less indebted than those in Europe and America. That, along with stimulus spending and sharply lower interest rates last year, allowed the region to escape the global downturn relatively unscathed, despite a sharp decline in exports as global demand plummeted in 2009.
As a result, the region's developing countries could see growth of 9.2 percent this year, according to the International Monetary Fund's latest projections, published this week. That compares with 3.3 percent and 1 percent, respectively, for the United States and Europe.
South Korea last month raised its official growth forecast for 2010 to 5.8 percent, from 5 percent.
Fast growth has brought inflation pressures, which the region's central banks are seeking to combat with their gradual rate increases.
The Bank of Korea said Friday that although the economy was on track for solid growth, inflation threats were set to mount.
"Consumer price inflation has so far remained in a range of somewhat above 2 percent but a little below 3 percent," the central bank said in a statement accompanying its rate decision. But it added that "upward pressures are expected to build continuously" because of the continued upturn in economic activity.
The bank pledged to maintain an "accommodative policy stance" to aid the economic recovery, but some analysts projected further small increases could be in the offing.
"Pending the release of further guidance, we are inclined to keep our call for an August rate hike, for now," commented Wai Ho Leong, a regional economist at Barclays Capital in Singapore, in a note, citing the central bank's apparent concern with inflation, and continued strong growth.

Full text: Athens, Ga.
ONE of the saddest lessons of this recession is that the United States has no adequate response for rising long-term unemployment. Contrast this with our policy for combating inflation: the Federal Reserve can always reduce the money supply, no Congressional approval required. There isn't a comparable mechanism to create jobs or to protect the long unemployed, no contingency plan that kicks in whenever job losses continue to mount.
During this recession, the Fed has tried to fight unemployment by cutting interest rates, but cheap money that no one wants to borrow is not an employment policy. After all, few businesses want to expand and hire new employees, given weak consumer demand. And though priming the pump with government money is the best way to increase demand, Congress has been reluctant to spend enough to set the economy on the right course.
Then there's the problem of unemployment benefits: Congress must vote on every extension and, with the latest impasse between Senate Republicans and Democrats, more than three million out-of-work Americans could lose their benefit payments by the end of the month. In the worst job market in decades, families won't have money to buy food and maintain health coverage, to keep up with mortgage payments and credit card bills.
It wasn't always this way. In 1970, Congress passed the Federal-State Unemployment Compensation Act, which established an automatic trigger: whenever unemployment increased to a certain point at a national or a state level, benefits were extended by 13 weeks.
The costs of these benefits were shared by the states, which paid them out of their regular unemployment insurance accounts, and the federal government, which increased taxes by about $8 per worker.
In the '80s and '90s, however, Congress diminished the effectiveness of the program by eliminating the national trigger, raising the state triggers and altering the trigger calculations in such a way that they hardly ever took effect. As a result, unemployed Americans now have to wait and worry as lawmakers debate each extension.
Fortunately, there is a simple solution: set up a new trigger. Heather Boushey from the Center for American Progress and I have proposed that whenever a state's total unemployment rate rises above 6.5 percent or jobless claims increase by more than 20 percent, benefits should be offered for an additional 20 or more weeks. This program should be fully financed by the federal government, thereby alleviating states' burden during the recession.
An automatic trigger would provide a tailored response to those states with the worst labor markets and eliminate the need for Congress to revisit this issue every few months. Most important, we could reduce some of the uncertainty for the jobless.

Full text: Inspired by mundane images, Roy Lichtenstein managed to create art that has become the stuff of legend: illustrations of advertisements for things like foot medication, hot dogs and BB guns, not to mention his signature reinterpretations of comic book images. The work of Lichtenstein, who died in 1997, has been studied and studied again, exhibited in museum retrospectives and galleries, like the show of still lifes now on view at Gagosian in Chelsea. It seems impossible there is anything new left to see.
But the Morgan Library & Museum, in its continuing effort to embrace the 20th and 21st centuries, has unearthed a group of black-and-white drawings never before shown together. Made between 1961 and 1968, these are not quick doodles done as preparatory drawings for paintings; they are finished drawings large in scale, many about three feet wide and two or three feet high.
"There are a finite number of them, fewer than 60 that exist, and we have tried to get all of them," said William M. Griswold, the Morgan's director. Loans for the show, "Roy Lichtenstein: The Black-and-White Drawings, 1961-1968," opening Sept. 24, have come from museums in the United States and abroad as well as from private collections.
While she was organizing the show, Isabelle Dervaux, the Morgan's curator of modern and contemporary drawings, was able to locate some of the advertisements, catalogs and clippings that were Lichtenstein's inspiration. She said she found the material in archives, including those of the Lichtenstein Foundation and of his longtime dealer, Leo Castelli. Some of the material will be included in the show.
Ms. Dervaux also worked with the Morgan's conservator to discover more about Lichtenstein's technique. They tried, for instance, to recreate his Benday dots of newsprint using a kind of ink called tusche ink. "We did a lot of experiments," she said, "including trying to make the dots with a liquid tusche, but it became too runny." They discovered that from 1963 on Lichtenstein used a lithographic rubbing crayon.
Before that he used a handmade, perforated stencil to make small irregular and unevenly spaced dots because he wanted to preserve the crudeness of the commercial images he was imitating. But in 1962 he bought a perforated industrial screen, which was more precise.
While his inspirations might have been lowbrow, like romance or superhero or war comics, he used materials of the highest quality, creating drawings on the finest sheets of watermarked artist's paper.
The contrast between many of the compositions and their inspirations shows that Lichtenstein did not simply copy what he saw but often reworked images. For "Keds," a 1962 picture based on an advertisement for Sears, Roebuck & Company, Lichtenstein gave greater emphasis to the geometric pattern on the sole of the sneaker. And in "Bratatat" and "Jet Pilot" -- two drawings taken from war comics that depict a pilot in his cockpit -- he honed in on the pilot's helmet and oxygen mask.
"Roy Lichtenstein" will be on view at the Morgan from Sept. 24 to Jan. 2 and then travel to the Albertina in Vienna.
A HOME FOR GRACES
Since the Metropolitan Museum of Art reopened its majestic Greek and Roman galleries in 2007, the centerpiece of the reimagined space has been the stunning marble sculpture "Three Graces." While most visitors have probably assumed it belongs to the museum, this second-century copy of a Greek work has been on loan from an anonymous collector since 1992.
This week the Met announced that after long negotiations it was able to buy -- with the help of numerous trustees and friends -- the "Three Graces" for a price it would not disclose. Experts familiar with the work say it has been valued at somewhere from $12 million to $15 million, although the museum was likely able to negotiate a lower price.
"We like loans to come to us as gifts, but sometimes we have to take other steps," said Thomas P. Campbell, the Met's director. "It's fair to say that this is one of the finest pieces of Roman sculpture to come on the market in several decades." Had the Met not been able to strike a deal, the sculpture would have probably headed to auction.
Provenance is often a problem with antiquities, but in this case, Mr. Campbell explained, the museum knows where the sculpture has been since 1892, when it was discovered in Rome by accident during construction work. It entered the collection of the Italian collector Joachim Ferroni, and after his death, in 1909, it belonged to Ercole Canessa, a celebrated Italian dealer.
In 1915 the Italian government decide to allocate a special exhibition area for Canessa's collections in the Italian pavilion of the Panama-Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco. The "Three Graces" has been in the United States ever since (probably sold through Canessa's New York gallery at first) and owned by a succession of New York collectors.
NEW RUINS
The replicated remnants of a classical column -- the romantic remains of an ancient ruin -- surrounded by debris including a sword, helmet and the body of a dead swallow will take over the Doris C. Freedman Plaza, at Fifth Avenue and 60th Street, in September. The work of the British artist Ryan Gander, "The Happy Prince" is an installation commissioned by the nonprofit Public Art Fund, which presents art around New York City.
Fashioned from reinforced concrete, the installation was inspired by Oscar Wilde's children's story "The Happy Prince," the tale of a gilded statue of a prince who befriends a swallow. The bird dies at the prince's feet, and the prince is toppled from his perch.
"Ryan Gander is an artist who I have been following for a while now," said Nicholas Baume, the Public Art Fund's director and chief curator. "Although he's had a significant career in Europe, he is not as well known here."
But that is about to change this fall. Not only because of the Public Art Fund's commission but also because the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum is planning a site-specific installation, on view from Oct. 1 to Jan. 9. It will be the third entry in its contemporary art series "Intervals."
In the installation visitors to the museum's Aye Simon Reading Room, off the second level of the Frank Lloyd Wright rotunda, will encounter debris very different from the kind that makes up "The Happy Prince." This work explores the failed friendship between the artists Piet Mondrian and Theo van Doesburg, collaborators who severed ties in 1924. Mr. Gander has imagined them crashing through a Wright stained-glass window with fragments of glass over books about Wright's life.
Also included in the installation is a second piece, a bronze $25 coin minted by a coin maker, that is Mr. Gander's wry comment on future inflation rates.

Vietnamese Hoard U.S. Dollars as a Hedge Against Inflation

Abstract: "The question mark at this point is whether the dollars will come in," said Ngiam Ai Ling, director of Asian sovereign ratings at Fitch Ratings in Singapore, which warned in March that it might cut Vietnam's rating, already below what the agency deems investment grade. Since 1986, when Vietnam adopted its "doi moi" program of economic liberalization -- commonly translated as "renovation" -- it has been taking grudging steps toward rejoining the global economy.

Full text: HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam -- The Ha Tam jewelry shop here sells foreign currency the way a filling station sells gasoline. So it was only seconds after pulling in on his motorbike that Quan Phan had swapped a fistful of Vietnamese dong for a neat stack of $100 bills -- United States $100 bills, to be precise.
"Vietnamese people always want to have dollars," Mr. Phan, an engineer, explained before rejoining a rush-hour swarm of motorbike commuters. He said he routinely converted part of his salary into greenbacks.
Developing countries -- and these days even developed ones like Greece and Spain -- constantly strive to retain the confidence of fickle foreign investors. Vietnam has a slightly different problem. Its government is struggling to restore faith among domestic investors like Mr. Phan.
What Vietnamese fear is not that their government has developed an Athenian affinity for deficits and debt. Hanoi's deficits are relatively modest, and it has not been in international financial markets long enough yet to rack up any serious i.o.u.'s. What makes them nervous is the suspicion that the governing Communist Party will do anything to hit its economic growth target before a party congress early next year, even if that means letting inflation get out of control.
To hedge against that possibility, Vietnamese have been vacuuming up gold and United States currency. So many dollars have been scooped up, in fact, that the country's central bank, the State Bank of Vietnam, is at risk of running out, analysts warn. Any shock, like a double-dip global recession that hurts exports or foreign investment, and Vietnam could find itself without enough dollars to pay for crucial imports like fuel, they say.
"The question mark at this point is whether the dollars will come in," said Ngiam Ai Ling, director of Asian sovereign ratings at Fitch Ratings in Singapore, which warned in March that it might cut Vietnam's rating, already below what the agency deems investment grade.
Since 1986, when Vietnam adopted its "doi moi" program of economic liberalization -- commonly translated as "renovation" -- it has been taking grudging steps toward rejoining the global economy. President Bill Clinton lifted the United States trade embargo in 1994, and the government in Hanoi signed a landmark trade pact with the United States in 2000, allowing it to export to America. In 2007, Vietnam was admitted to the World Trade Organization.
Those efforts have yielded results. In 2008, Vietnam sidestepped the global recession, growing 5.3 percent and pulling its gross domestic product per capita above $1,000 while keeping incomes more evenly distributed than in the United States.
But the balance-of-payments predicament is only the latest of several hard knocks the country has endured as a traveler on the bumpy free-market road, and policy makers learning to use capitalist tools to navigate often find themselves reaching instead for more familiar Communist ones.
"They're moving away from a system of controls and directives toward a system based on market-based instruments," said Benedict Bingham, the International Monetary Fund's resident representative in Hanoi. But the landscape is shifting as they do. "The economy has shifted toward more faster-moving, private sector behavior. That has made macroeconomic management more complicated."
Analysts and executives say Vietnam needs to do more to remove the state's unsteady hand, primarily by privatizing state-owned industries to stimulate more efficient improvements in infrastructure.
"The country doesn't even have enough electricity," said Adam Sitkoff, executive director of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hanoi. "It doesn't have adequate infrastructure in any category." Inflation, meanwhile, has been the all too common side effect of Vietnam's emergence. A recurring feature of the Vietnam War, hyperinflation returned in the late 1980s and early 1990s with an investment boom that followed doi moi. Now any new sign of it sends the public scurrying for more dollars, creating a vicious cycle that pushes the dong down and pushes prices even higher.
In the last two years, the Vietnamese currency has fallen 15 percent amid such concerns. The local version of the television game show "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" offers a top prize of 120 million dong -- a potential windfall equivalent to only $6,300. The result is what economists refer to as the dollarization of Vietnam's economy. Things as varied as hotel rooms and cameras are priced in dollars.
Where do all those greenbacks go? Many go into low-yielding dollar deposits at banks. But another portion -- no one knows how many dollars circulate in Vietnam -- gets stashed at home.
Safes are a popular household item in Vietnam. A recurring crisis for the Vietnamese, therefore, occurs every time the United States Treasury changes the security features on large American bills, and money-changers reject older varieties.
High savings are a feature of Asian economies, one that economists say helps to perpetuate global trade imbalances and may have been a factor in the global crisis. Like other economies in the region, Vietnam is also a big exporter, the world's second-largest exporter of rice and coffee. And like many of its neighbors, it fixes the official exchange rate of its currency against the dollar.
But Vietnam is still at such a comparatively low level of development that it has to import many of the manufactured goods it needs to keep growing. And while it exports oil, it has to import refined products for fuel. As a result, the country runs a net trade deficit.
So while other Asian nations accumulate dollars to keep their currencies from rising, Vietnam has been shedding dollars to keep the dong from falling and thereby worsening inflation, even though letting the dong depreciate freely would make its exports even cheaper.
Vietnam was one of the few economies to avoid the global recession, but by the end of last year it was clear that Asia as a whole was recovering quickly and that Vietnam was back to the races. With inflation resurging, the government faced new downward pressure on the dong.
In November, the central bank raised interest rates to quell inflation. And, unable to pull the dong's street value back up to the official exchange rate, it lowered the official rate so it could stop selling dollars at what amounted to a discounted rate. In February, it lowered the official rate again.
The dong has stabilized somewhat now, and credit growth has cooled. But Vietnamese investors and analysts remain skeptical that the situation has entirely stabilized, largely because efforts to control inflation are accompanied by statements from Hanoi supporting faster economic growth.
Early next year, the Communist Party is scheduled to hold its 11th National Congress, a major period of political jockeying, analysts say. For government officials, they say, achieving growth targets is an important test. Last month, Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung predicted that G.D.P. would not only reach the government's target but exceed it.
Yet the central bank's efforts sometimes seem to be at cross purposes. While it has imposed a 1 percent ceiling on dollar savings accounts to discourage demand for the currency among its citizens, it is also trying to buy dollars to buttress its own reserves, said Ms. Ling at Fitch.
"Fundamentally, our concern is that Vietnam is a command economy," she said. While the central bank has not released current figures for reserves, Fitch estimates that they have fallen to less than two months' worth of imports. Economists normally recommend at least three.
"That's a weak number to play with," she said.

Full text: CORRECTION APPENDED
Juanita M. Kreps, who was President Jimmy Carter's secretary of commerce from 1977 to 1979, the first woman and the first economist to hold a post traditionally occupied by men with business interests, died Monday in Durham, N.C. She was 89.
The cause was complications of Alzheimer's disease, her daughter, Laura Anne Kreps, said.
Dr. Kreps, who lived in Durham, wrote books and taught economics much of her life. But economics was no abstract subject to this daughter of an Appalachian coal mine operator, a child of the Depression and a broken home who had worked her way through college, climbed rungs of academic achievement to become vice president of Duke University and won high marks running the Commerce Department.
Only three other women had served in the cabinet previously: Frances Perkins as Franklin D. Roosevelt's labor secretary (1933-45); Oveta Culp Hobby as Dwight D. Eisenhower's health, education and welfare secretary (1953-55); and Carla A. Hills as Gerald R. Ford's housing and urban development secretary. Dr. Kreps was one of two women appointed to Mr. Carter's cabinet in 1977, the other being Patricia Roberts Harris, in housing and urban development.
Commerce was perhaps the most unglamorous, thankless job in the cabinet: managing 38,000 employees and an oracular mandate to promote economic growth while taking the census, forecasting the weather, recording patents and trademarks, standardizing weights and measures, charting seas, collecting statistics on the nation's output of goods and services, and managing $6 billion in public works projects.
Like her predecessors, Dr. Kreps was an advocate for the business community, promoting exports, international trade and domestic commerce amid rising inflation and unemployment. She became the nation's traveling saleswoman, taking trade missions to the Soviet Union, Europe, Africa and Asia. In 1979, she negotiated a historic trade agreement with China.
While not in the inner circle of Carter advisers, she gave the president a crucial boost when his standing with business had ebbed, organizing meetings for him with corporate leaders in 1977 to map anti-inflation and economic strategies. Talk of a crisis in business confidence waned, and many executives, though skeptical at first, came to regard Dr. Kreps as an ally.
But she also pressed business to look beyond profits and act with greater social responsibility toward employees, consumers and the public interest, with measures including affirmative-action programs and steps to protect the environment and strengthen corporate integrity. She was an advocate for women and older workers, the unemployed, minority-owned businesses, and development in depressed urban areas.
She supported new laws to ensure privacy for millions of consumers, requiring insurance, financial and credit card companies to tell customers about information collected on them, to explain adverse decisions affecting them, and to accord them rights to challenge erroneous data in their files.
The genteel, low-key Dr. Kreps held her own against powerful cabinet rivals. She battled with the Treasury over trade-regulation enforcement, with the State Department over commercial attaches who help American businesses overseas, and with the national security adviser over sensitive technology exports to Communist countries.
Dr. Kreps resigned after nearly three years, her tenure shortened after her husband's apparent suicide attempt.
Juanita Morris was born in Lynch, Ky., on Jan. 11, 1921, the sixth child of Elmer M. Morris, a struggling mine operator, and Larcenia Blair Morris. Her parents divorced when she was 4, and she lived with her mother until age 12, when she was placed in a boarding school. She was an excellent student but recalled a childhood of poverty and unhappiness.
At Berea College, a pioneer in work-study programs for poor southern Appalachian students, she majored in economics and graduated with high honors in 1942. Studying economics on scholarships at Duke, she earned a master's degree in 1944 and a doctorate in 1948.
In 1944, she married Clifton H. Kreps Jr., an economics professor. He died in 2000. She was also predeceased by a daughter, Sarah. Besides her daughter Laura Anne, of Durham, Ms. Kreps is survived by a son, Clifton III, of Kirksville, Mo.; a brother, Herbert Witt, of Fishers, Ind.; and four grandchildren.
Accompanying her husband in a series of academic posts, she taught economics at Denison University from 1945 to 1950, at Hofstra College from 1952 to 1954, and at Queens College in New York in 1954-55. She joined the Duke faculty in 1955, and after writing several books, she became a full professor in 1968. In 1972 she became the James B. Duke professor of economics, the first woman to hold that prestigious chair.
Dr. Kreps was dean of the Woman's College at Duke and associate provost from 1969 to 1972; in 1973 she was named its vice president. In 1972 she became the first woman to be named a director of the New York Stock Exchange. She also served as a director of many of the country's best-known corporations, including J. C. Penney, R. J. Reynolds, Citicorp and AT&T.
Her specialty, the labor demographics of women and older workers, infused her articles and books, including "Sex in the Marketplace: American Women at Work" (1971), which examined employment discrimination and the burdens of working women with families; "Lifetime Allocation of Work and Leisure: Essays in the Economy of Aging" (1971); and "Women and the American Economy" (1976).
Like many women she wrote about, Dr. Kreps faced conflicts between her private and public lives. When President Carter offered her the cabinet post, a family discussion ensued. Her children were grown, but her husband could not leave his post as Wachovia professor of banking at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.
Her Washington experience proved to be exhilarating but lonely, Dr. Kreps told The New York Times in 1977. She went home to Durham almost every weekend, but travel and other duties limited her family contacts.
In June 1979, her husband suffered what the police called a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. He survived, and a few months later, Dr. Kreps resigned and returned to Duke, where she retired as vice president emerita.
In 1985, Duke established the Juanita and Clifton Kreps chair in economics. In later years, she served on government commissions and was the recipient of many awards and 15 honorary degrees.

Correction: July 10, 2010, Saturday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A picture caption on Thursday with an obituary about Juanita M. Kreps, who was President Jimmy Carter's secretary of commerce from 1977 to 1979, referred incorrectly to Mr. Carter. When the photograph of Ms. Kreps with Mr. Carter was taken, in December 1976, he was the president-elect; he was not yet president.

Full text: For the sake of argument, let's say that the Senate refuses to take the most obvious steps to help the economy.
These steps -- like preventing layoffs of teachers, police officers and other government workers -- are especially important now that the recovery has lost some steam. But we're going to imagine a world in which the Senate is incapable of distinguishing between the long-run budget deficit (a big problem) and the near-term deficit (quite manageable, according to financial markets). So even modest, short-term spending bills can't pass.
In that unpleasant world, could Congress still do anything to help the economy?
Yes, it could.
It could clear up some of the uncertainty about future government policy and, in the process, persuade companies to spend some of the $1.8 trillion in cash they have hoarded. Congress could agree to help struggling states if, and only if, they took steps to reduce their own long-term deficits. And Congress could push two opaque bureaucracies on opposite sides of the world -- the Federal Reserve and the Chinese Communist Party -- to do more for global growth.
Direct stimulus, important as it may be, isn't the only option. Here are five relatively cheap ways to lift growth:
A RACE TO SOLVENCY New Jersey's new Republican governor, Christopher Christie, had the nub of an intriguing idea recently. He lobbied voters to reject school budgets -- rejections that would have led to layoffs -- unless local education unions agreed to pay more for their health benefits. In effect, Mr. Christie was offering to save jobs now in exchange for saving money later.
It's a trade more states should consider. State and local governments are on course to have budget shortfalls of about $400 billion, or 2 percent of the nation's entire economic output, by 2030, according to the Government Accountability Office. The main reasons are health costs and pensions.
Imagine if Washington offered to help states get through today's shortfalls in exchange for making progress on their long-run problems. In the ideal version of this program, states would get some initial money without strings attached. They need it to avoid those teacher and firefighter layoffs. States that came up with credible plans to reduce their deficits would then get more money over the next few years.
I realize this idea will make some Democrats uncomfortable, but it doesn't have to be a partisan issue. After all, does it really make sense for states to be cutting back on essential services so that some workers can retire at 55? "Why should state workers or city workers or county workers have benefits that are far better than private sector workers?" Edward Rendell, the Democratic governor of Pennsylvania, told me earlier this year. "We should have parity, not better."
LIFT TRADE American exports rose 11.5 percent from early 2009 to early this year, accounting for more than half of total economic growth. But this momentum will be hard to maintain if China's currency remains as undervalued as it is.
Beijing recently announced that it would allow its currency to rise. One factor was the political pressure from other countries, including from our Congress, like a proposal by Senator Charles Schumer of New York and others that would put tariffs on Chinese-made goods. The bill is a blunt form of punishment that has the potential to set off a trade war. It's also a useful threat, so long as China's currency plans remain vague.
Another good step would be a trade deal with South Korea, which President Obamarecently said he was pursuing.
PROVIDE CLARITY Corporate executives complain that uncertainty about regulation has made them wary of expanding. Some of their complaints are classic political posturing -- an attempt to avoid oversight by claiming it will hurt the larger economy. In reality, consumer demand and Europe's woes are much more important sources of uncertainty.
But the complaints aren't totally without merit. Washington has indeed passed some sweeping new laws recently. Fortunately, with health reform starting to take effect and financial regulation on the verge of passing, the future is starting to look clearer for businesses trying to make decisions.
One big piece of uncertainty remains, though: energy. Several energy chief executives have said they have major projects ready to go, if only they knew what was going to happen to the cost of emitting carbon. The same is no doubt true of nonenergy companies trying to make decisions about new buildings and factories.
The Senate still has a small window to pass an energy bill this summer. A good bill would include a cap on power plant emissions, making clear how much more expensive those emissions would become. Such a bill wouldn't help only the climate, as Jim Rogers of Duke Energy says. It would be a form of stimulus, too.
LEVERAGE TAXPAYER MONEY Last year's big stimulus bill included $2.3 billion for promising clean energy projects. To qualify for the money, companies had put up 70 percent of a project's cost, in exchange for a tax credit equal to 30 percent. The idea -- just as with cash for clunkers -- was to use a relatively small amount of government spending to spur much more private spending.
The program turned out to be quite popular. The Energy Department received requests for more than $10 billion in credits and judged about $8 billion to be worthy. But it had only $2.3 billion to spend, so most qualified applicants got nothing.
A bipartisan handful of senators, including Richard Lugar and Orrin Hatch, both Republicans, have since called for an expansion of the program. It would not be free, of course. But it could provide good bang for the buck.
The federal government could leverage its spending in other ways, too. It could give households an incentive to improve the energy efficiency of their homes -- cash for caulkers -- and could look for similar investment incentives for companies outside the energy sector.
THE FED'S MISSIONBen Bernanke, the Fed chairman, seems genuinely torn about how weak the economy is. He has said that inflation is not a problem and that unemployment will probably remain high for years. Even so, he has been unwilling to push down long-term interest rates, which would encourage more consumer and business spending.
Mark Thoma, a monetary economist who writes a well-read blog, points out that Mr. Bernanke is in a political bind. He has been criticized by regional Fed presidents who always seem to worry that inflation is about to accelerate and who want the Fed to raise rates. But Mr. Bernanke faces no such internal pressure about the other part of the Fed's mission: maximizing employment.
That could begin to change next week. The Senate will hold confirmation hearings for three new Fed governors, all of whom have the potential to make it a more balanced institution. It couldn't hurt if a few senators used those hearings to review some basic facts: inflation has been zero lately, inflation expectations are tame, 15 million Americans remain unemployed and job growth has slowed in recent months.
To be clear, these five steps might not provide as much of an immediate lift as the obvious steps, like rapid aid to states, extended unemployment benefits and better access to credit for small businesses. But nothing is stopping Congress from pursuing both sets of strategies. The economy is still suffering the effects of the worst financial crisis since the 1930s. It needs all the help it can get.

Abstract: [...] Hetal Mehta, an economist at the Ernst & Young ITEM Club economic forecasting group, said that while there was evidence that some companies had increased prices or kept them steady, there was little indication that workers were asking for higher pay.

Full text: LONDON -- Committee members at the Bank of England and some economists have been puzzled by persistently high inflation in Britain, causing some concerns that the country's recovery might stagnate.
Unlike in the United States and in countries that share the euro, inflation in Britain never came close to zero in 2009. And while core inflation, which excludes food and energy prices, has declined in countries like France, Germany, Italy and the United States since the beginning of 2008, it has risen in Britain and is now above 3 percent, more than twice the rate in the euro zone.
The reason depends on whom you ask.
Mervyn King, the governor of the Bank of England, Britain's central bank, has written six letters to the British Treasury since the beginning of 2008 explaining why inflation had risen more than one percentage point above the bank's 2 percent annual inflation target. The letters -- until recently a rare reminder of the working arrangements between the government and the Bank of England -- became so frequent that many economists joked that Mr. King was happy to have found a new pen pal in George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer.
In each letter, Mr. King named a different set of one-off events, including a drop in the pound and higher commodity prices, as the reason for inflation and predicted that the effects of a weak economy would push inflation lower. But after two years, some economists are questioning whether there is not more to the persistence of the inflation rate, which was at 3.4 percent in May.
"It's noticeable that the U.K. is growing in the opposite direction of the U.S. and the euro zone," said Danny Gabay, a director at Fathom Financial Consulting in London and a former author of the Bank of England's inflation report. "Economic growth surprised on the downside and inflation on the upside. That's a very uncomfortable position to be in."
Britain's economy grew 0.3 percent in the first quarter, helped by growth in manufacturing.
Persistently higher inflation rates could limit the Bank of England's ability to keep interest rates low to allow for a more stable recovery, some economists said. The bank, which has a mandate to keep inflation low, is expected to keep interest rates unchanged at 0.5 percent on Thursday.
The bank previously said that it was "very concerned about what's been happening to inflation" and "how resilient inflation has been," especially against the background of a recession.
It named three main factors as causing the higher rate: Oil prices were on average nearly 80 percent higher than at the beginning of 2009; the government restored a 17.5 percent sales tax in January after cutting it to help consumers; and a 26 percent drop in the pound against the dollar in 2008 drove prices higher.
Some economists disagreed, however. Higher commodity prices were not unique to Britain, and the euro also slumped against major currencies, albeit recently. Economists also pointed out that price increases were especially strong in the service sector, pushing up the cost of items like insurance, which are not directly related to currency exchange rates.
"The inflation issue recently has been higher levels of service sector inflation," Stuart Green, chief British economist at HSBC in London, said. "That's very unique to the U.K."
The inflation rate also generated a debate within the Bank of England. Charles Bean, the deputy governor, said a lack of lending by banks might have made companies more concerned about cash flow and less willing to cut prices than in previous economic downturns.
Another member of the monetary policy committee, Adam Posen, in a speech last month blamed expectations of inflation for rising consumer prices. Mr. Posen argued that the Bank of England's previous decisions to keep interest rates at a record low even as inflation crept up led consumers to expect that inflation would remain high for a while.
Expectations of higher inflation usually prompt companies to increase prices and workers to push for higher wages.
"The most logical and empirically reasonable explanation for inflation creep is some unanchoring of inflation expectations caused by a series of above-target outcomes for U.K. inflation in recent years," Mr. Posen said.
But Hetal Mehta, an economist at the Ernst & Young ITEM Club economic forecasting group, said that while there was evidence that some companies had increased prices or kept them steady, there was little indication that workers were asking for higher pay. Since 610,000 public-sector jobs are to be cut by 2016 under the government's austerity program, that is not likely to change.
Still, concern among some economists is mounting that Bank of England policy makers might feel pressed to raise interest rates because of inflation, even if the economy has not recovered fully. Those economists fear that increasing rates too soon could push the economy back into a recession.
Andrew Sentance on June 10 became the first committee member to vote for a rate increase in almost two years. Dr. Sentance later told Reuters that he was concerned about inflation expectations and said he would prefer "gradual" interest rate increases.
Mr. Sentance also raised doubts about the strength of existing deflationary pressures, hinting that prices might continue to rise because more companies than initially thought went bankrupt and the supply of products suffered.
Despite disagreements about the roots of higher consumer prices, many economists expect the Bank of England to keep interest rates unchanged until at least next year. The government's austerity program, which includes a sales tax increase to 20 percent next January, means inflation could remain volatile.
"They should sound worried about inflation but also be mindful that there is a bigger danger, and that's to increase rates when the economy is still low," Mr. Gabay said. "If both consumers and the government save, things can turn ugly very quickly."

Abstract: According to the latest teardown report compiled by iSuppli, a market research firm in El Segundo, Calif., the bulk of what Apple pays for the iPhone 4's parts goes to its chip suppliers, like Samsung and Broadcom, which supply crucial components, like processors and the device's flash-memory chip.

Full text: SHENZHEN, China -- Last month, while enthusiastic consumers were playing with their new AppleiPhone 4, researchers in Silicon Valley were engaged in something more serious.
They cracked open the phone's shell and started analyzing the new model's components, trying to unmask the identity of Apple's main suppliers. These "teardown reports" provide a glimpse into a company's manufacturing.
What the latest analysis shows is that the smallest part of Apple's costs are here in Shenzhen, where assembly-line workers snap together things like microchips from Germany and Korea, American-made chips that pull in Wi-Fi or cellphone signals, a touch-screen module from Taiwan and more than 100 other components.
But what it does not reveal is that manufacturing in China is about to get far more expensive. Soaring labor costs caused by worker shortages and unrest, a strengthening Chinese currency that makes exports more expensive, and inflation and rising housing costs are all threatening to sharply increase the cost of making devices like notebook computers, digital cameras and smartphones.
Desperate factory owners are already shifting production away from this country's dominant electronics manufacturing center in Shenzhen toward lower-cost regions far west of here, even deep in China's mountainous interior.
At the end of June, a manager at Foxconn Technology -- one of Apple's major contract manufacturers -- said the company planned to reduce costs by moving hundreds of thousands of workers to other parts of China, including the impoverished Henan Province.
While the labor involved in the final assembly of an iPhone accounts for a small part of the overall cost -- about 7 percent by some estimates -- analysts say most companies in Apple's supply chain -- the chip makers and battery suppliers and those making plastic moldings and printed circuit boards -- depend on Chinese factories to hold down prices. And those factories now seem likely to pass along their cost increases.
"Electronics companies are trying to figure out how to deal with the higher costs," says Jenny Lai, a technology analyst at CLSA, an investment bank based in Hong Kong. "They're already squeezed, so squeezing more costs out of the system won't be easy."
Apple can cope better than most companies because it has fat profit margins of as much as 60 percent and pricing power to absorb some of those costs. But makers of personal computers, cellphones and other electronics -- including Dell, Hewlett-Packard and LG -- deal with much slimmer profit margins according to several analysts. "The challenges are going to be much bigger for them," Ms. Lai said. Most other industries, from textiles and toys to furniture, are under considerably more pressure.
One way to understand the changes taking shape in southern China is to follow the supply chain of the iPhone 4, which was designed by Apple engineers in the United States, sourced with high-tech components from around the world and assembled in China. Shipped back to the United States, the iPhone is priced at $600, though the cost to consumers is less, subsidized by AT&T in exchange for service contracts.
"China makes very little money on these things," said Jason Dedrick, a professor at Syracuse University and an author of several studies of Apple's supply chain. Much of the value in high-end products is captured at the beginning and end of the process, by the brand and the distributors and retailers.
According to the latest teardown report compiled by iSuppli, a market research firm in El Segundo, Calif., the bulk of what Apple pays for the iPhone 4's parts goes to its chip suppliers, like Samsung and Broadcom, which supply crucial components, like processors and the device's flash-memory chip.
In the iPhone 4, more than a dozen integrated circuit chips account for about two-thirds of the cost of producing a single device, according to iSuppli.
Apple, for instance, pays Samsung about $27 for flash memory and $10.75 to make its (Apple-designed) applications processor; and a German chip maker called Infineon gets $14.05 a phone for chips that send and receive phone calls and data. Most of the electronics cost much less. The gyroscope, new to the iPhone 4, was made by STMicroelectronics, based in Geneva, and added $2.60 to the cost.
The total bill of materials on a $600 iPhone -- the supplies that go into final assembly -- is $187.51, according to iSuppli.
The least expensive part of the process is manufacturing and assembly. And that often takes place here in southern China, where workers are paid less than a dollar an hour to solder, assemble and package products for the world's best-known brands.
No company does more of it than Foxconn, a division of the Hon Hai Group of Taiwan, the world's largest contract electronics manufacturer.
With 800,000 workers in China alone and contracts to supply Apple, Dell and H.P., Foxconn is an electronics goliath that also sources supplies, designs parts and uses its enormous size and military-style efficiency to assemble and speed a wide range of products to market.
"They're like Wal-Mart stores," Professor Dedrick said. "They're low-margin, high-volume. They survive by being efficient."
The world of contract manufacturers is invisible to consumers. But it's a $250 billion industry, with just a handful of companies like Foxconn, Flextronics and Jabil Circuit manufacturing and assembling for all the global electronics brands.
They compete fiercely on price to earn small profit margins, analysts say. And they seek to benefit from tiny operational changes.
When a company is operating on the slimmest of profit margins as contract manufacturers are, soaring labor costs pose a serious problem. Wages in China have risen by more than 50 percent since 2005, analysts say, and this year many factories, under pressure from local governments and workers who feel they have been underpaid for too long, have raised wages by an extra 20 to 30 percent.
China's currency has also appreciated sharply against the United States dollar since 2005, and after a two-year pause by Beijing, economists expect the renminbi to rise about 3 to 5 percent a year for the next several years.
"It takes 3,000 procedures to assemble an H.P. computer," says Isaac Wang, an iSuppli analyst based in China. "If a contract manufacturer can find a way to save 10 percent of the procedures, then it gets a real good deal."
Contract manufacturers like Foxconn are now searching for ways to reduce costs. Foxconn is considering moving inland, where wages are 20 to 30 percent lower. The company is also spending heavily on manufacturing many of the parts, molds and metals that are used in computers and handsets, even trying to find larger and cheaper sources of raw material.
"We either outsource the components manufacturing to other suppliers, or we can research and manufacture our own components," says Arthur Huang, a Foxconn spokesman. "We even have contracts with mines which are located near our factories."
Many analysts are optimistic the big brands will find new innovations to improve profitability. But within the crowd, there is growing skepticism about China's manufacturing model after years of pressing workers to toil six or seven days a week, 10 to 12 hours a day.
"We've concluded Hon Hai's labor-intensive model is not sustainable," says Mr. Wang at iSuppli Research. "Though it can keep hiring 800,000 to one million workers, the problem is these workers can't keep working like screws in an inhuman system."
This type of low-end assembly work is also no longer favored in China, analysts say, because it does not produce big returns for the companies or the country. "China doesn't want to be the workshop of the world anymore," says Pietra Rivoli, a professor of international business at Georgetown University and author of "The Travels of a T-Shirt in the Global Economy."
"The value goes to where the knowledge is."

Full text: CORRECTION APPENDED
WASHINGTON -- As federal regulators consider a proposal to cut most Saturday postal deliveries, the business community is sharply divided about the consequences of switching to five-day service.
Some, like Donald J. Hall Jr., chief executive of Hallmark Cards, said that eliminating Saturday delivery and raising prices even incrementally would drive more business away from the United States Postal Service, resulting in a "slippery slope."
But others, like Andrew Rendich, the chief service and DVD operations officer at Netflix, said five-day delivery would be a better alternative to significantly higher postal rates. "Big rate increases will absolutely squash business and will absolutely slow growth for a company like Netflix," Mr. Rendich said.
The post office estimates that cutting Saturday delivery would result in savings of $3 billion a year, though the Postal Regulatory Commission, which will make a recommendation to the post office on its proposal, estimates smaller savings, about $2 billion a year.
The commission begins hearings on the service changes on July 12. In addition to eliminating most Saturday deliveries, the post office has proposed cutting its work force through attrition and wants the option to raise prices above the rate of inflation for some classes of mail.
Ruth Y. Goldway, chairwoman of the regulatory commission, said that part of the agency's goal was to determine whether moving to five-day delivery would ultimately harm the service even if it would be helpful in the short term.
"The real communication networks have to be 24/7," Ms. Goldway said. "The Postal Service in fact should be expanding its accessibility and delivery capability to meet those needs. The long-term future of the Postal Service may be limited by their interest in reducing service today."
A recent joint hearing of Senate and House committees offered a preview of the debate expected to play out before the commission. Executives from several businesses that make heavy use of the post office, including Mr. Hall of Hallmark and Mr. Rendich of Netflix, disagreed on the long-term viability of a five-day delivery plan.
Small businesses, large corporations, private citizens and trade associations of all sizes have also weighed in at hearings held by the regulatory commission around the country.
The volume of first-class mail, used by businesses for invoices, account statements and advertisements, fell 15 percent from 2006 to 2009, according to the service. The volume of packages, driven by online purchases, has increased, and the service estimates it will continue to grow about 3 percent a year. Still, officials estimate the service will lose $7 billion this year.
"The reality that folks need to come to grips with is there simply is not enough mail in the system any longer for us to sustain a six-day network," said Sam Pulcrano, vice president for sustainability at the post office.
Some businesses and trade groups are conflicted about the best approach.
"You have a group of mailing interests who absolutely need Saturday delivery for their businesses and oppose reducing six days to five," said Arthur B. Sackler, executive director of the National Postal Policy Council, whose membership includes mailers like American Express, Aetna and Citigroup. "You have other businesses that don't like it but are willing to accept it as a necessary evil given the Postal Service's financial condition."
The council has not taken a position on the five-day proposal because, Mr. Sackler said, its membership is divided.
He said credit card and insurance companies would be seriously affected by five-day delivery because they issue frequent notifications to customers. "There's going to be a lot of volume that's going to be delayed in terms of processing," he said. "That affects not only cash flow but billing cycles."
Already, Mr. Sackler said, "companies that can are diverting mail online." The elimination of Saturday delivery, he thinks, will only accelerate that process.
Mark D. Merritt, chief executive of the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association, whose membership includes companies that deliver prescription drugs by mail, said in an interview that postage increases coupled with one fewer day of delivery would be the worst outcome.
Other mailers said they might turn to private carriers if the proposal was adopted. Tonda Rush, director of public policy at the National Newspaper Association, which mostly represents weekly newspapers, many of which have Saturday editions, said those newspapers would have to consider private delivery. "It doesn't seem to us that the Postal Service has done the analysis of the potential new competitors it's creating," Ms. Rush said.
The regulatory commission's recommendation, which it expects to make in October, will be nonbinding. The final decision will be up to Congress, which since 1983 has required mail delivery six days a week.
The post office has also proposed changing a requirement, introduced in 2006, that it pay for the health benefits of its retirees in advance instead of using a pay-as-you-go system. That requirement costs the service about $5.5 billion annually.
"Some people think that if it was given this two- or three-year breather, it could come up with new plans, new ideas and be able to manage once again without taxpayer subsidy for some time to come," Ms. Goldway said. "Without having this kind of breathing room, it's very hard to do that."
Few elected officials at the recent joint Congressional hearing had anything positive to say about the five-day proposal, raising doubts about its chances. Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri, said that the service could lose a significant competitive advantage by cutting Saturday delivery, because other carriers charge more to deliver on weekends.
"Maybe we need to focus on six-day delivery as the lead on how we can compete as opposed to abandoning it first," she said.
Representative Jason Chaffetz, Republican of Utah, suggested that cost-cutting alone would not save the service and that instead it should be asking itself how it could become more relevant to customers. He said he planned to introduce a bill that would allow the service to cut up to 12 days of delivery a year.

Correction: July 7, 2010, Wednesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Because of an editing error, an article on Tuesday about the possibility of ending Saturday mail delivery misstated the time period during which the volume of first-class mail dropped 15 percent. It fell that much from 2006 to 2009, not the reverse.

Abstract: Today, Turkey is a fast-rising economic power, with a core of internationally competitive companies turning the youthful nation into an entrepreneurial hub, tapping cash-rich export markets in Russia and the Middle East while attracting billions of investment dollars in return.

Full text: ISTANBUL -- For decades, Turkey has been told it was not ready to join the European Union -- that it was too backward economically to qualify for membership in the now 27-nation club.
That argument may no longer hold.
Today, Turkey is a fast-rising economic power, with a core of internationally competitive companies turning the youthful nation into an entrepreneurial hub, tapping cash-rich export markets in Russia and the Middle East while attracting billions of investment dollars in return.
For many in aging and debt-weary Europe, which will be lucky to eke out a little more than 1 percent growth this year, Turkey's economic renaissance -- last week it reported a stunning 11.4 percent expansion for the first quarter, second only to China -- poses a completely new question: who needs the other one more -- Europe or Turkey?
"The old powers are losing power, both economically and intellectually," said Vural Ak, 42, the founder and chief executive of Intercity, the largest car leasing company in Turkey. "And Turkey is now strong enough to stand by itself."
It is an astonishing transformation for an economy that just 10 years ago had a budget deficit of 16 percent of gross domestic product and inflation of 72 percent. It is one that lies at the root of the rise to power of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has combined social conservatism with fiscally cautious economic policies to make his Justice and Development Party, or A.K.P., the most dominant political movement in Turkey since the early days of the republic.
So complete has this evolution been that Turkey is now closer to fulfilling the criteria for adopting the euro -- if it ever does get into the European Union -- than most of the troubled economies already in the euro zone. It is well under the 60 percent ceiling on government debt (49 percent of G.D.P.) and could well get its annual budget deficit below the 3 percent benchmark next year. That leaves the reduction of inflation, now running at 8 percent, as the only remaining major policy goal.
"This is a dream world," said Husnu M. Ozyegin, who became the richest man in Turkey when he sold his bank, Finansbank, to the National Bank of Greece in 2006. Sitting on the rooftop of his five-star Swiss Hotel, he was looking at his BlackBerry, scrolling down the most recent credit-default spreads for euro zone countries. He still could not quite believe what he was seeing.
"Greece, 980. Italy, 194 and here is Turkey at 192," he said with a grunt of satisfaction. "If you had told me 10 years ago that Turkey's financial risk would equal that of Italy I would have said you were crazy."
Having sold at the top to Greece, Mr. Ozyegin is now putting his money to work in the east. His new bank, Eurocredit, gets 35 percent of its profit from its Russian operations.
Mr. Ozyegin represents the old guard of Turkey's business elite that has embraced the Erdogan government for its economic successes. Less well known but just as important to Turkey's future development has been the rapid rise of socially conservative business leaders who, under the A.K.P., have seen their businesses thrive by tapping Turkey's flourishing consumer and export markets.
Mr. Ak, the car leasing executive, exemplifies this new business elite of entrepreneurs. He drives a Ferrari to work, but he is also a practicing Muslim who does not drink and has no qualms in talking about his faith. He is not bound to the 20th-century secular consensus among the business, military and judicial elite that fought long and hard to keep Islam removed from public life.
On the wall behind his desk is a framed passage in Arabic from the Koran, and he recently financed an Islamic studies program just outside Washington at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va., where Mr. Erdogan recently spoke.
Whether he is embracing Islam as a set of principles to govern his life or Israeli irrigation technology for his sideline almond and walnut growing business, Mr. Ak represents the flexible dynamism -- both social and economic -- that has allowed Turkey to expand the commercial ties with Israel, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Iran and Syria that now underpin its ambition to become the dominant political actor in the region.
Other prominent members of this newer group of business executives are Mustafa Latif Topbas, the chairman and a founder of the discount-shopping chain BIM, the country's fastest-growing retail chain, and Murat Ulker, who runs the chocolate and cookie manufacturer Yildiz Holding.
With around $11 billion in sales, Yildiz Holding supplies its branded food products not just to the Turkish market but to 110 markets globally. It has set up factories in Kazakhstan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Ukraine and now owns the Godiva brand.
The two billionaires have deep ties to the prime minister -- Mr. Erdogan once owned a company that distributed Ulker-branded products, and Mr. Topbas is a close adviser -- but the trade opportunities in this part of the world are plentiful enough that a boost from the government is now no longer needed.
In June, Turkish exports grew by 13 percent compared with the previous year, with much of the demand coming from countries on Turkey's border or close to it, like Iraq, Iran and Russia. With their immature manufacturing bases, they are eager buyers of Turkish cookies, automobiles and flat-screen televisions.
This year, for example, the country's flagship carrier, Turkish Airlines, will fly to as many cities in Iraq (three) as it does to France. Some of its fastest growing routes are to Libya, Syria and Russia, Turkey's largest trading partner, where it flies to seven cities. That is second only to Germany, which has a large population of immigrant Turks.
In Iran, Turkish companies are building fertilizer plants, making diapers and female sanitary products. In Iraq, the Acarsan Group, based in the southeastern town of Gaziantep, just won a bid to build five hospitals. And Turkish construction companies have a collective order book of over $30 billion, second only to China.
On the flip side, the Azerbaijani government owns Turkey's major petrochemicals company and Saudi Arabia has been a big investor in the country's growing Islamic finance sector.
No one here disputes that these trends give Mr. Erdogan the legitimacy -- both at home and abroad -- to lash out at Israel and to cut deals with Iran over its nuclear energy, moves that have strained ties with its chief ally and longtime supporter, the United States. (Turkey has exported $1.6 billion worth of goods to Iran and Syria this year, $200 million more than to the United States.)
But some worry that the muscle flexing may have gone too far -- perhaps the result of tightening election polls at home -- and that the aggressive tone with Israel may jeopardize the defining tenet of Turkey's founder, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk: peace at home, peace in the world.
"The foreign policy of Turkey is good if it brings self-pride," said Ferda Yildiz, the chairman of Basari Holding, a conglomerate that itself is in negotiations with the Syrian government to set up a factory in Syria that would make electricity meters.
Even so, he warns that it would be a mistake to become too caught up in an eastward expansion if it comes at the expense of the country's longstanding inclination to look to the West for innovation and inspiration.
"It takes centuries to make relations and minutes to destroy them," he said.

Full text: Magazine publishers are preparing to go to war with the United States Postal Service over an emergency rate increase that the postmaster general is expected to ask for on Tuesday.
The Postal Service, which is on track to lose about $7 billion this year, can raise postage rates on its own once a year as long as the increase does not exceed the rate of inflation.
But this time the Postal Service says that an increase on par with inflation, which has been relatively subdued as the economy edges its way out of recession, will not be enough.
The prospect of paying higher postage rates is distressing to many magazines at a time when they are still trying to stabilize their businesses. Publishers say that any increase will force them to absorb the cost or to raise newsstand and subscription rates, neither of which they are eager to do.
"It's real money," said James R. Cregan, the executive vice president for government affairs with the Magazine Publishers of America. "It makes a tremendous difference."
"We are going to be litigating this if the Postal Service insists on filing to raise rates," he added. "We believe we have extremely strong arguments on the law and on the economics of this."
The postmaster general, John E. Potter, has not indicated how much of a rate increase he will seek on Tuesday when he requests a new pricing structure from the Postal Regulatory Commission, which oversees the Postal Service's operations.
A spokesman for the Postal Service said only that the price increase sought would be "moderate." Any rate increase would not go into effect until 2011.
The postmaster general has said that the service continues to lose money because the rates that some mail customers pay -- nonprofits and periodicals, for example -- do not cover the actual cost of mailing.

Same Kind of Crime, Different Accent

Abstract: Through its first 13 episodes on the British network ITV, the series has based each of its stories on an episode drawn from the first seven seasons of the American "Law & Order," changing details but staying true to the outlines of the case and its resolution, and keeping the famous sound cue between scenes. A 9-month-old boy is abandoned at a hospital, dead of carbon monoxide poisoning in the British version and hypothermia in the American; the investigation eventually leads to the owner of the apartment building where the child died.

Full text: PITY the "Law & Order" purist. Now that the mother ship has been canceled after 20 seasons, what are you supposed to do if "SVU" leaves you cold, "Criminal Intent" bores you, and the thought of this fall's "Law & Order: Los Angeles" scares the hell out of you? If only the real thing will do -- and if you've seen every rerun on TNT and USA at least twice -- there is still one place to turn.
It's a place where the people are represented by two separate yet equally important groups: the police who investigate the crime and the Crown Prosecutors who prosecute the offenders. It's called London, and it's the setting of "Law & Order: UK," the "L&O" spinoff that remains most faithful to the original show.
Perhaps "faithful" is an understatement. To some extent "Law & Order: UK" is the original show, with British accents and detective superintendents rather than captains or lieutenants. Through its first 13 episodes on the British network ITV, the series has based each of its stories on an episode drawn from the first seven seasons of the American "Law & Order," changing details but staying true to the outlines of the case and its resolution, and keeping the famous sound cue between scenes. (Other European spinoffs use a similar strategy but with different models: the French version draws on "Law & Order: Criminal Intent" and the Russian on "Law & Order: SVU.")
The British series has not been broadcast in the United States, but a DVD of the first season (shown in two chunks in Britain, in 2009 and 2010) is available through Target; it's currently on sale at target.com for $29.99. Some Americans who live close enough to the Canadian border can also see it on the Canadian network Citytv. The show has been a hit in Britain, averaging more than six million viewers, and a large part of that can be attributed to good bones. It's hard to go wrong when hand-picking scripts from the early seasons of "Law & Order."
For an American fan, watching those scripts relocated to the Old Bailey and the banks of the Thames is an experience both familiar and disorienting. The British team, led by the writer and producer Chris Chibnall ("Torchwood," "Life on Mars"), has done a frighteningly thorough job of replicating the pace, rhythm and look of the original. Inveterate rerun watchers familiar with the American episodes in question will notice, however, that the ambience the British show captures is that of the latter-day "Law & Order," more brightly colored and theatrical than the relatively somber, low-key early seasons.
A head-to-head comparison of American and British episodes reveals additional differences that probably have less to do with a cultural gap than with the gap between 2010 and the early 1990s, when the American episodes were made.
The British pilot, "Care," was based on "Cradle to Grave" from the second American season. A 9-month-old boy is abandoned at a hospital, dead of carbon monoxide poisoning in the British version and hypothermia in the American; the investigation eventually leads to the owner of the apartment building where the child died.
In "Care" the roles of the boy's mother and the apartment owner are both expanded, with the mother becoming more sympathetic and the landlord less so. The effect is to make the issues more black and white and the tone more moralistic, a shift captured in the closing arguments of the prosecutors. Michael Moriarty's Ben Stone, in New York, shrugs and says, "Putting them in jail is the only remedy we have." Ben Daniels's James Steel, in London, squares his shoulders and declares, "We all have a duty of care to one another, and no breach shall go unpunished."
A similar dramatic inflation takes place in "Buried," based on the American second-season episode "... In Memory Of." The same character is revealed as the killer in both versions, but the American case is resolved with a plea agreement, almost in passing, while the British case requires a dramatic courtroom confession. The British episode also ends with charged encounters outside the courthouse, a scene entirely absent from the original.
Normally a British adaptation of an American show could be expected to have an advantage in terms of acting, but again, the bar set by "Law & Order," particularly in its first five seasons, was so high that the best the new series can do is a close second. Mr. Daniels, Jamie Bamber ("Battlestar Galactica") and the much-honored stage actress Harriet Walter are fine but no match for their models, Mr. Moriarty, Chris Noth and Dann Florek. The fine Scottish actor Bill Paterson seems uncomfortable as the chief prosecutor, the role Steven Hill filled effortlessly for 10 seasons.
The standouts so far are Bradley Walsh ("Coronation Street"), who gets the right blend of humor and resignation in the Paul Sorvino-Jerry Orbach veteran detective slot, and Freema Agyeman (Martha Jones of "Dr. Who"), who covers several bases as the junior prosecutor. She's both the minority idealist, played for three seasons by Richard Brooks, and the hot babe who often solves the case, played by a succession of actresses (none hotter than Ms. Agyeman).
The format adopted for "Law & Order: UK" makes these sorts of comparisons to "Law & Order" unavoidable, if not entirely fair. If you haven't seen the originals, the new series will certainly stand on its own as a superior crime drama. If you have seen them, you'll probably still enjoy their British adaptations, even if their primary effect is to remind you that "Law & Order," in its heyday, was a superlative crime drama.

Full text: BEIJING (AP) -- China's economy grew even faster in 2009 than previously reported, adding to concern that the flood of stimulus spending and loans that drove its rebound left a dangerous glut of unneeded factories and other assets.
The government raised its estimate of 2009 growth on Friday from 8.7 percent -- already the fastest among major economies -- to 9.1 percent, raising China's economic output to the equivalent of $4.98 trillion. That suggested Japan clung to its title as the second-largest economy with just under $5.1 trillion in output.
Beijing propelled its recovery from the global slump with a 4 trillion renminbi ($590 billion) stimulus and record 2009 bank lending of 9.6 trillion renminbi ($1.4 trillion). But communist leaders worried that the stimulus drove overspending on factories and other facilities, which could lead to economic problems if producers were forced to slash prices in glutted markets or could not repay bank loans.
"There definitely are risks of overcapacity from all this investment," said Ken Peng, a Citigroup economist. He said Beijing was likely to have to step in and repay at least some debts for overextended state companies or local governments.
Makers of steel and textiles are likely to be hit hardest because they have the biggest oversupply and foreign demand for their goods is weak, said Lu Zhengwei, senior economist for Industrial Bank in Shanghai.
Steel producers, which expanded output as demand from stimulus-financed construction projects surged, have 16 million tons of unsold stock, state television said Friday. It said mills were selling steel at prices below cost.
"The problems in the steel and textile industries will have a clear negative impact on the Chinese economy," Mr. Lu said.
Business groups have cautioned that China might face a protectionist reaction from the United States, Europe and other trading partners if its overcapacity leads exporters to cut prices at a time of weak global demand.
The government also has warned of overcapacity in cement, glass, polysilicon used for solar panels and wind power equipment. It says new facilities must meet higher environmental standards and it will shut down small steel mills.
The cabinet is trying to promote industrial consolidation and the closure of outdated steel mills and other facilities, and announced Thursday that it would promote mergers among Chinese companies. Authorities said they wanted companies to use stimulus money to improve technology and were trying to force older facilities to close, often precipitating resistance by local leaders who object to job losses.
"Of course when you have newer, better capacity, the old capacity might not go offline, so I think the government is trying to stamp that out," Mr. Peng said.
Beijing routinely revises economic growth estimates, and the National Bureau of Statistics said Friday's figure was the result of data gathered since its initial announcement in January.
The bulk of the increase came from service industries, a positive sign for government efforts to reduce reliance on manufacturing to drive growth.
Last year's heavy spending prompted fears of a surge in inflation. But that has turned to concern about slowing growth as the effect of the stimulus wears off and Beijing imposes lending curbs to cool a sharp rise in housing prices.
Economic growth surged to 11.9 percent over a year earlier in the first quarter of the year and inflation hit 3.1 percent in May, exceeding the official full-year target of 3 percent. But indicators of manufacturing and investment show activity slowing and inflation pressure easing.

Full text: The train that is the nation's economic recovery has slowed noticeably, unable to generate enough jobs in the last two months to keep pace with population growth, much less reduce the vast numbers of unemployed Americans.
The United States added just 83,000 private sector jobs in June, according to the monthly statistical snapshot released by the Labor Department. The unemployment rate declined to 9.5 percent, from 9.7 percent in May. But that was a largely illusory decline, as 652,000 Americans left the work force.
Over all, the nation lost 125,000 jobs in June, but those losses came as temporary federal Census workers headed for the exits.
With the economy slowing -- housing sales plummeted, while earnings and hours worked ticked downward last month -- the stakes grow larger, economically and politically. The next few monthly unemployment reports will unfold during the run-up to the midterm Congressional elections this fall. Incumbents feel particularly precarious, and major economic decisions about financial reform, unemployment benefits, and aid to states still sit on their desks.
"We may have seen the best of employment for some time," said Paul Kasriel, chief economist at Northern Trust. "In general the economy is downshifting, maybe to stall speed, or just above stall."
Even longtime optimists pulled in their horns a touch. While they pointedly distanced themselves from those economists who worry about a double-dip recession, or a stagnant and lost decade, enthusiasm was hard to detect.
"Obviously, it was a disappointing report," said Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist at the Economic Outlook Group. "And it comes on top of a whole lot of other economic indicators that painted a bleak picture for the country."
Mr. Baumohl predicted, as others did, that this jobs report would add fuel to the fiery debate between deficit hawks and pump-primers in Washington. He favored government intervention, but he tends toward the view that it no longer makes as much difference.
"Government spending prevented the U.S. economy from tipping into a depression," he said. "But beyond that, the government cannot, short of war, get private companies to increase hiring if they don't want to."
Just as May's jobs report appeared deceptively robust, swollen by 411,000 workers hired by the federal government to help with the Census, so the June report appears deceptively anemic, as the government shed 225,000 of those workers.
Signs of strength could be spotted. The 83,000 private sector jobs created in June more than doubled the count in May. In the first six months of 2009, the nation lost 3.7 million private sector jobs; during the first six months of this year it gained 590,000. Manufacturing continued a modest revival, as plants added 9,000 jobs, bringing the total for such jobs to 136,000 since January (manufacturing shed two million jobs early in this recession). Amusement, gambling and recreation businesses added 28,000.
Health care inched up 9,000, for a 12-month gain of 217,000 jobs. And professional firms continued to add temporary workers, 21,000 last month. In past recessions, such hiring often was a precursor of permanent hires.
President Obama offered restrained applause for the jobs report even as he acknowledged the economy remained weak.
"Make no mistake -- we are headed in the right direction," Mr. Obama told reporters before boarding Air Force One to fly to West Virginia for the funeral of Senator Robert C. Byrd. "We're not headed there fast enough for a lot of Americans. We're not headed there fast enough for me either."
Indeed, the economy needs to add about 130,000 jobs each month just to keep pace with new workers entering the market. The labor pool is packed with 15 million Americans looking for work, and state and local governments cut another 10,000 jobs in June, cuts likely to accelerate this summer.
The weeks leading up to Friday's report offered a grim rat-a-tat-tat of statistics pointing to a slowing economy. Auto sales fell, housing sales plunged and unemployment claims rose to a peak higher than is normal for an economic recovery.
And Friday's labor data offered many more signs of slippage. The labor-force participation rate -- that is, the number of workers counted as participating in the national economy -- fell by 0.3 percentage point. And the picture remained unyieldingly grim for the long-term unemployed. The median duration of unemployment rose to 25.5 weeks in June, from 23.2 in May.
More and more Americans are being left behind. In June, about 2.6 million people were marginally attached to the labor force, a rise of 415,000 from a year earlier. This means they are not counted in the unemployment numbers, but they have looked during the last year and want a job.
The overall unemployment rate, incorporating all such Americans, stood at 16.5 percent.
"This economic recovery does not have enough momentum to sustain on its own without government help," said Sung Won Sohn, an economist at California State University, Channel Islands, and a former chief economist at Wells Fargo. "Businesses are reluctant to hire for fear of a double-dip recession. Without jobs, the economy can't grow, limiting job growth and spending."
Christina Romer, chairwoman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, described the economy as a ship on stormy global waters. European nations are slashing budgets, China's economy has cooled and the stock markets are caught between indigestion and serious worries. Yet the United States labor force is larger than a year ago, she said, and the jobless rate is lower.
"Two months ago, the world was getting giddy and it was better than anyone expected," she said in an interview. "In the past two weeks, the news is on the other side, worse than expected."
This is not, she said, a normal recovery "because it was not a normal recession. There are some strong headwinds."
The velocity of those headwinds, particularly around jobs, could imperil Democratic control of the Senate and House. Several weeks ago, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. christened this "Recovery Summer," emphasizing the jobs created by the $787 billion economic stimulus measure passed in February 2009.
Now some wonder if those gains can be sustained.
The national economy looks like a slack muscle. Prices and wages are dormant or falling, banks are holding tight to credit, consumers appear fatigued and the stock market is tumbling. And 3.2 million workers are losing their unemployment benefits because Congress turned down President Obama and declined to authorize an extension.
Paul Krugman, the economist and New York Times columnist, warned recently of the risk of another Great Depression. Many economists disagree with that view, saying the sluggishness will end this fall or winter.
Others, however, join Mr. Krugman in warning that stagnation could loose another wolf: deflation. "In the winter of 2009, I said the risks are for inflation, not deflation," Mr. Kasriel noted. "In the summer of 2010, I think the risks are now tilted toward deflation. We run the risk of entering a really bad environment."

Full text: WASHINGTON -- President Obama gets high marks, even from some Republicans, for the way he has begun carrying out the new health care law in the 100 days since it was signed. And a new poll suggests a small increase in favorable views of the measure since May.
But it remains unclear whether a substantial number of people will see tangible benefits before the November elections, and whether those benefits will help Democrats who voted for the legislation and are facing resistance from voters who view it as fiscally irresponsible and overly intrusive.
The administration has issued a blizzard of regulations, including a patient's bill of rights, and has persuaded insurance companies to make some changes sooner than required by the law. It has also assembled a team of insurance experts to help carry out the law, under close supervision from the White House.
"I give them an A for effort," said Stuart M. Butler, a vice president of the conservative Heritage Foundation. "But there are land mines down the road because the law is fundamentally flawed."
Stephen E. Finan, a health economist at the American Cancer Society, said: "I am extremely impressed with what the administration has accomplished. They have cranked out a lot of regulations. They're doing it methodically, and they're doing it well."
On Thursday, the administration unveiled a Web site, HealthCare.gov, where consumers can obtain information about public and private health insurance options in their states. The administration and many states are also setting up high-risk insurance pools for people who have been denied coverage because of pre-existing conditions.
In the last three months, administration officials have issued rules allowing young adults to stay on their parents' policies and forbidding insurers to deny coverage to children with pre-existing conditions. They have notified nearly four million small businesses of a new tax credit to help defray the cost of insurance.
On Tuesday, they began accepting applications for a separate program that will reimburse employers for some of the cost of providing health benefits to early retirees. And the government has begun sending $250 checks to Medicare beneficiaries with high drug costs.
Ronald F. Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a liberal-leaning consumer group, described these initial steps as confidence-builders. "If they work well," Mr. Pollack said, "they will give people confidence that the broader reforms will be helpful."
Insurers, who fought the legislation, now say they hope it will succeed. "We are working to get new products on the market by Sept. 23," said Alissa Fox, a senior vice president of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association. "After that date, we can't sell new policies to individuals or small groups unless they comply with the new standards."
While Mr. Obama hopes to gain political benefits from the law, he is, in some ways, caught in a political trap. No Republicans voted for the final bill. Republican leaders say their goal is to "repeal and replace" it. In response to daily Republican attacks, the White House defends every feature of the law, potentially creating expectations that will be difficult to fulfill in the near future.
Representative Dave Camp of Michigan, the senior Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee, said the White House had significantly overstated the benefits of the law, most recently in a brochure sent to people on Medicare. The brochure looks like "taxpayer-funded propaganda," Mr. Camp said.
The new poll, conducted June 17-22 by the Kaiser Family Foundation, found that 48 percent of Americans had favorable views of the law, while 41 percent had unfavorable views. The favorable share was 41 percent in May and 46 percent in April.
Americans remain deeply divided. Roughly a third of voters say that a candidate who voted for the health care law is more likely to get their vote, a third say less likely, and nearly a third say it does not make much difference.
By far the least popular feature of the law, according to the poll, is a requirement for most Americans to have insurance or pay a fine, starting in 2014. The public may not accept the requirement until courts rule finally on its constitutionality. A federal district judge in Richmond, Va., heard arguments on the question on Thursday.
In recent weeks, Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services, has emerged, in effect, as the national insurance commissioner. She criticizes insurers by name when she believes they are seeking excessive rate increases, and she urges states to reject such requests.
To date, economists see no evidence that the law has slowed the explosive growth of health spending, and some administration officials worry that it could fuel medical inflation. Mr. Obama has become adept at jawboning insurers. He told insurance executives last week that they must not use the law as an excuse for big rate increases.
Insurers say they wish that Mr. Obama would put similar pressure on doctors and hospitals, whose services account for about half of all health spending.
Consumer advocates, insurance companies and state insurance regulators have been working together to develop one of the most important new rules, requiring insurers to return at least 80 percent of premium dollars to policyholders in the form of health benefits or rebates.
"This experience is restoring my faith in the ability of government and people from different sectors to work together constructively when there is a clear imperative and a set of deadlines," said Amy R. Bach, executive director of United Policyholders, a national consumer rights organization based in San Francisco.
But several developments in recent days point to problems that could threaten the success of the new law.
The Congressional Budget Office said that federal health spending, including "all the effects of the recently enacted health care legislation," was still on an unsustainable course.
Mr. Obama just signed a bill providing temporary relief to doctors who treat Medicare patients. But doctors face a 21 percent cut in their Medicare fees in December, with a further cut of 5 percent scheduled for January.
The new law calls for a major expansion of Medicaid, the program for low-income people, but it became apparent this week that some states could not afford the programs they had. Governors said they would have to cut services and lay off employees if they did not receive more help from the federal government.

Full text: HONG KONG -- Two closely watched measures of the manufacturing sector in China declined in June in the latest sign that Beijing's efforts to scale back stimulus have begun to moderate the growth of the world's largest developing nation.
A manufacturing purchasing managers' index, compiled by the China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing and released on Thursday, came in below expectations at 52.1, down from 53.9 the previous month. A similar index by HSBC also sagged, from 52.7 in May to 50.4 in June.
Readings above 50 indicate expansion, so the June figures showed that the Chinese manufacturing sector is still growing. But the declines confirmed what many economists have long projected: that the pace of China's growth probably hit its highest level during the first quarter of this year and that more modest rises are now in store -- a situation that has been largely engineered by the country's authorities in a bid to prevent the economy from overheating.
Tao Wang, an economist at UBS in China, wrote in a report this week previewing the June data that "economic growth is strong but momentum has peaked."
Qu Hongbin, chief China economist at HSBC, commented in a statement accompanying the bank's P.M.I. release Thursday that fears that China could experience a hard landing were "overplayed."
"We expect China to achieve around 9 percent growth in the second half, underpinned by massive ongoing investment and robust private consumption," he wrote.
And analysts at Barclays Capital commented in a note that better-than-expected export figures from South Korea in June, also released Thursday, were "another reminder that growth in Asia may not be about to keel over just yet."
Still, Europe's sovereign debt woes, and a rash of labor unrest in China, are expected to add to Chinese companies' difficulties in coming months, while the slight rise in the renminbi that the authorities are now permitting will squeeze margins for exporters.
Financial markets in China and elsewhere in Asia reacted badly to the signs of slowing growth and to the accompanying uncertainty as to what policy measures Beijing might still implement.
The Shanghai composite index, the main market gauge for mainland China, slipped 1 percent on Thursday, taking its total decline since the start of this year to 27 percent. The index has been one of the world's worst performers so far in 2010, along with Greece.
"Our baseline scenario is for a soft landing in G.D.P. growth and rising but modest inflation," Ms. Wang of UBS wrote in her note this week. "However, continued policy uncertainty, including in the property sector, and the decelerating sequential momentum will weigh on the market."
So far this year, the Chinese authorities have launched an array of initiatives to rein in growth. These have ranged from instructing banks to extend fewer loans to moves designed to curtail the sharp price rises seen in much of the country's property sector. Many economists expect the central bank to stage at least one small increase in interest rates before the end of this year.
In Japan, meanwhile, a quarterly survey conducted by the central bank and released Thursday showed a surprisingly sharp rise in business confidence among large manufacturers.
The reading in June stood at 1, compared with minus 14 the previous month.
A positive reading shows that optimists outnumber pessimists. The so-called Tankan survey also found that large manufacturers planned to increase capital spending slightly, indicating that, so far, an overall improvement in the economy is outweighing concerns about the potential impact of Europe's debt worries and about the sharp decline in the euro against the yen and other currencies.
Still, despite the healthy Tankan reading, growth is expected to remain anemic in Japan, with economists at Credit Suisse, for example, forecasting expansion of 2.9 percent this year. China, by contrast, is widely projected to grow 10 percent in 2010, allowing it to overtake Japan as the world's second-largest economy, after the United States.
Japan's stock market took no comfort from the firm Tankan. The Nikkei 225 index ended 2 percent lower.
Indexes elsewhere also fell. In South Korea, the Kospi declined 0.7 percent, and the market in Australia, whose economy is highly dependent on Chinese demand for its mineral riches, dropped 1.5 percent.
The Straits Times index in Singapore was down about 0.6 percent by late afternoon, and in India, the Sensex fell 1 percent.
The Hong Kong market was closed for a public holiday.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text: BRUSSELS -- The market storm over the fate of the euro has calmed to prevailing winds, but there is considerable nervousness here over the economic health of Spain, the impact of austerity on long-term growth and continuing differences between France and Germany over the economic direction of the European Union.
Similar divisions were evident in the recent Group of 20 meeting, between a Europe bent on deficit reduction and a United States still promoting stimulus spending, a friction that analysts say contributed to a shaky week in world financial markets.
Both President Nicolas Sarkozy of France and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany are weakened by the financial crisis and public unhappiness, and both are maneuvering for their economic conceptions of Europe. Mrs. Merkel is demanding stability, fiscal rigor and a European Central Bank that focuses on keeping inflation low, while Mr. Sarkozy favors looser discipline, with room for stimulus spending and more concentration on promoting economic growth.
To complicate matters further, they are trying to thrash this out within a new European Union structure that is still confused and inchoate.
Market and diplomatic concerns are compounded by the uneven pace at which the European Union moves, lurching from summit meeting to summit meeting to find one ad hoc patch after another, and the slowness of European officials to work out their new institutional arrangements after ratification of the Lisbon Treaty last December.
Under that treaty, the new European president of the council of national leaders, Herman Van Rompuy, an economist and former Belgian prime minister, has moved more quickly than others to establish a powerful staff. Given the urgency of the economic crisis and the need for decisions by national leaders, he has managed to "presidentialize" decision-making, undercutting the influence of the European Commission, national finance ministers and the Eurogroup led by Jean-Claude Juncker, which sets economic policy for countries using the euro currency.
While not able to impose his will on Mr. Sarkozy or Mrs. Merkel, who dislike each other, Mr. Van Rompuy has worked hard to be a discreet and calming intermediary, senior European officials say. Europe's institutional confusions have made the French-German relationship even more important, rather than less, these officials say.
Mr. Van Rompuy's negotiating skill has also overshadowed Jose Manuel Barroso, the president of the European Commission, the permanent bureaucracy, which has had little to offer in a crisis founded in the debts and budget deficits of governments in the 16-nation euro zone. Even worse, France and Germany have sent relatively weak commissioners to serve in Brussels, and Germany in particular has been adamant in refusing to cede any new economic powers to the commission. Mrs. Merkel also insisted that Mr. Van Rompuy, not Mr. Barroso, be put in charge of a task force to recommend euro-zone reforms.
At the same time, the new high representative for foreign and security policy, Catherine Ashton, has made barely a ripple. She has concentrated on replacing her staff and negotiating with the European Parliament and nations over the shape and personnel of the new External Action Service, a European Union diplomatic corps intended to supplement and coordinate, but not replace, national diplomats. The service, which could end up with about 5,000 diplomats, will incorporate current overseas representatives of the commission, who are maneuvering to keep their posts.
Mr. Barroso, however, has already created waves by appointing his former chief of staff, a fellow Portuguese, Joao Vale de Almeida, to the new European Embassy in Washington, one of the most prominent posts to be filled in addition to those in Moscow and Beijing, without consulting member states.
Ms. Ashton, too, is trying to manage the French-German gap, looking to the current French ambassador in Washington, Pierre Vimont, as the most likely executive director of the new service, with a German deputy, perhaps Helga-Maria Schmid, who runs the policy unit of the council's secretariat.
But while the Europeans are slowly constructing these new institutions and bureaucrats are struggling for dominance within them, the French-German divide remains deep, European and national diplomats say.
Mr. Sarkozy and Ms. Merkel know they must cooperate if Europe is to function, and their staffs and ministries work hard to coordinate. Franco-German agreement is "necessary but not sufficient," as Mr. Barroso said in an interview here.
At each crisis, usually after German hesitation, the two have found a compromise, as they did at the last summit meeting in mid-June. But both leaders are increasingly unpopular, with Mr. Sarkozy battling ministerial scandals and Mrs. Merkel just managing to force through her choice for the ceremonial German presidency.
The two leaders are pulled in different directions by their electorates. The Germans do not want to finance others in Europe and demand austerity, while the French are unhappy about pension reform and coming, if still vague, budget cuts.
"They are patching things over," a senior European official said. "They are coordinating, but out of necessity, so halfheartedly, not out of choice or conviction."
In addition to their differences over growth policies, Mr. Sarkozy wants an "economic government" of the European Union to coordinate fiscal policies at the level of the 16 nations of the euro zone, the better to put pressure the European Central Bank to be more flexible on interest rates. Mrs. Merkel has accepted the French terminology of economic government but insists that it include all 27 members of the European Union, to water down French influence.
Mr. Sarkozy wants the economic government to have its own secretariat, which Mrs. Merkel has so far managed to reject, while the Germans want harsh sanctions, including the possibility of expulsion from the euro zone, against nations that flagrantly break the rules.
At base, Germany wants the rest of Europe to behave as it does -- pursuing policies of low inflation, nearly balanced budgets and export-led growth -- and sees no reason to change. But France says that without more German consumption to accompany greater austerity and competitiveness from others, trade imbalances within the euro zone will sink it.
In an article published this week in Le Monde, Hubert Vedrine, the former French foreign minister, wrote that the French-German relationship urgently needed a fresh, public debate to find a synthesis. "France and Germany rarely have the same initial positions on issues," he wrote. "Now the disagreements are somehow many. But there is, yet, no alternative in Europe to the French-German entente."

Abstract: Latin America, beset in the past by debt defaults, currency devaluations and the need for bailouts from rich countries, is experiencing robust economic growth that is the envy of its northern counterparts. Some scholars of Latin America's economic history of ups and downs say the robust recovery may be too good to last, pointing to volatile politics in some places, excessive reliance on commodity exports and the risks of sharply increasing trade with China.

Full text: LIMA, Peru -- While the United States and Europe fret over huge deficits and threats to a fragile recovery, this region has a surprise in store. Latin America, beset in the past by debt defaults, currency devaluations and the need for bailouts from rich countries, is experiencing robust economic growth that is the envy of its northern counterparts.
Strong demand in Asia for commodities like iron ore, tin and gold, combined with policies in several Latin American economies that help control deficits and keep inflation low, are encouraging investment and fueling much of the growth. The World Bank forecasts that the region's economy will grow 4.5 percent this year.
Recent growth spurts around Latin America have surpassed the expectations of many governments themselves. Brazil, the region's rising power, is leading the regional recovery from the downturn of 2009, growing 9 percent in the first quarter from the same period last year. Brazil's central bank said Wednesday that growth for 2010 could reach 7.3 percent, the nation's fastest expansion in 24 years.
After a sharp contraction last year, Mexico's economy grew 4.3 percent in the first quarter and may reach 5 percent this year, the Mexican government has said, possibly outpacing the economy in the United States.
Smaller countries are also growing fast. Here in Peru, where memories are still raw of an economy in tatters from hyperinflation and a brutal, two-decade war against Maoist rebels that left almost 70,000 people dead, gross domestic product surged 9.3 percent in April from the same month of last year.
"We're witnessing what are probably the best economic conditions in Peru in my lifetime," said Mario Zamora, 70, who owns six pharmacies in Los Olivos, a bustling working-class district of northern Lima where thousands of poor migrants from Peru's highlands have settled.
Vibrancy mixes with grit around his pharmacies. A Domino's Pizza vies for customers with Peruvian-Chinese restaurants called chifas. Motorcycle taxis deliver passengers to nightclubs. Competition, in the form of a newly arrived Chilean pharmacy chain, looms around the corner from his main store.
Los Olivos offers a glimpse into the growth lifting parts of Latin America out of poverty, but big exceptions persist. In Venezuela, electricity shortages and fears of expropriations caused gross domestic product to shrink 5.8 percent in the first quarter.
But Venezuela, and to a lesser extent Ecuador, another oil-dependent country that lags behind its neighbors in growth, seem to be exceptions to a broader trend.
Even small countries ideologically aligned with Venezuela have adopted pragmatic policies and are faring well. While Europe was gripped by fears of contagion from Greece's debt crisis, the credit rating agencyStandard & Poor's upgraded Bolivia in May, citing its sound public finances.
Latin America's growth largely reflects a deepening engagement with Asia, where China and other countries are also growing fast. China surpassed the United States last year as Brazil's top trading partner, and is the second largest trading partner in countries like Venezuela and Colombia, Washington's top ally in the region.
Some scholars of Latin America's economic history of ups and downs say the robust recovery may be too good to last, pointing to volatile politics in some places, excessive reliance on commodity exports and the risks of sharply increasing trade with China.
Michael Pettis, a specialist at Peking University in Beijing on China's financial links with developing countries, said the region was especially exposed to Chinese policies that had driven up global demand for commodities, including what appears to be Chinese stockpiling of commodities.
"Within China there is a ferocious debate over the sustainability of this investment-driven growth," Mr. Pettis said. "I'm worried that too few policy makers in Latin America are aware of the debate and of the vulnerability this creates in Latin America."
Other economists, including Nicolas Eyzaguirre, director of the Western Hemisphere department of the International Monetary Fund, suggest that low international interest rates, another factor supporting Latin America's growth, will not last much longer. Even so, they applaud home-grown policies that are supporting growth.
Chile, for instance, saved revenues from copper exports when commodities prices climbed, allowing it to enact a stimulus plan last year and rebound from the February earthquake. Chile's economy grew 8.2 percent in April from the previous month, its biggest increase since 1996.
"This time around, the positive shock is probably even better, since some countries saved at least part of their windfall from the good years," Mr. Eyzaguirre said.
Within the fund itself, Latin America's recovery is translating into new political sway, particularly for Brazil, which has paid its debt to the fund and is seeking to enhance its voting stake in it. As Brazil posts China-level growth, President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva is nurturing soft-power ambitions, with ventures like a state television station that will broadcast to African nations.
David Rothkopf, a former Commerce Department official in the Clinton administration, pointed to the dozens of embassies and consulates that Mr. da Silva has opened around the world.
"Like other Latin American countries, Brazil needs to improve its infrastructure and train more engineers," Mr. Rothkopf said, "but it embodies the rise of emerging powers, one of the great themes of this century."
Peru, whose economic growth is expected to rival or outstrip Brazil's over the next several years, exemplifies the challenges remaining in a sizzling economy.
The country boasts nimble companies like Ajegroup, founded during the chaos of the 1980s. Now the company's soft drinks compete with giants like Coca-Cola, not just in Peru but in other Latin American countries as well.
Foreign investment has flowed into Peru, largely in mining. But this investment reveals both weaknesses and strengths. Mining accounts for about 8 percent of economic activity, but about half of tax revenues, creating problems if commodities prices fall, said Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, a former finance minister here.
Deep inequalities also persist, especially between the capital, Lima, and the Andean highlands and the forests of the Amazon basin, where factions of the Shining Path guerrilla group feed off the cocaine trade. As much as 70 percent of the labor force still works outside the tax system, depriving workers of benefits and the government of revenue.
But some of what glitters in Peru's boom seems to be paving the way for lasting prosperity. Felipe Castillo, 60, mayor of Los Olivos, is investing tax proceeds in a new low-tuition municipal university for 4,000 students. He gazed recently at the 11-story structure, in a slum that has begun to take on the trappings of a lower-middle-class district.
"Maybe the students at this institution will look at the mistakes of our economic policy in the past as the tragic features of a bygone era," Mr. Castillo said.

Full text: The world's rich countries are now conducting a dangerous experiment. They are repeating an economic policy out of the 1930s -- starting to cut spending and raise taxes before a recovery is assured -- and hoping today's situation is different enough to assure a different outcome.
In effect, policy makers are betting that the private sector can make up for the withdrawal of stimulus over the next couple of years. If they're right, they will have made a head start on closing their enormous budget deficits. If they're wrong, they may set off a vicious new cycle, in which public spending cuts weaken the world economy and beget new private spending cuts.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, pessimism seemed the better bet. Stocks fell around the world, with more steep drops in Asia Wednesday morning over worries about economic growth.
Longer term, though, it's still impossible to know which prediction will turn out to be right. You can find good evidence to support either one.
The private sector in many rich countries has continued to grow at a fairly good clip in recent months. In the United States, wages, total hours worked, industrial production and corporate profits have all risen significantly. And unlike in the 1930s, developing countries are now big enough that their growth can lift other countries' economies.
On the other hand, the most recent economic numbers have offered some reason for worry, and the coming fiscal tightening in this country won't be much smaller than the 1930s version. From 1936 to 1938, when the Roosevelt administration believed that the Great Depression was largely over, tax increases and spending declines combined to equal 5 percent of gross domestic product.
Back then, however, European governments were raising their spending in the run-up to World War II. This time, almost the entire world will be withdrawing its stimulus at once. From 2009 to 2011, the tightening in the United States will equal 4.6 percent of G.D.P., according to the International Monetary Fund. In Britain, even before taking into account the recently announced budget cuts, it was set to equal 2.5 percent. Worldwide, it will equal a little more than 2 percent of total output.
Today, no wealthy country is an obvious candidate to be the world's growth engine, and the simultaneous moves have the potential to unnerve consumers, businesses and investors, says Adam Posen, an American expert on financial crises now working for the Bank of England. "The world may be making a mistake, and it may turn out to make things worse rather than better," Mr. Posen said.
But he added -- after mentioning China, India and the relative health of the financial system, today versus the 1930s -- that, "The chances we're going to come out of this O.K. are still larger than the chances that we aren't."

The policy mistakes of the 1930s stemmed mostly from ignorance. John Maynard Keynes was still a practicing economist in those days, and his central insight about depressions -- that governments need to spend when the private sector isn't -- was not widely understood. In the 1932 presidential campaign, Franklin D. Roosevelt vowed to outdo Herbert Hoover by balancing the budget. Much of Europe was also tightening at the time.
If anything, the initial stages of our own recent crisis were more severe than the Great Depression. Global trade, industrial production and stocks all dropped more in 2008-9 than in 1929-30, as a study by Barry Eichengreen and Kevin H. O'Rourke found.
In 2008, though, policy makers in most countries knew to act aggressively. The Federal Reserve and other central banks flooded the world with cheap money. The United States, China, Japan and, to a lesser extent, Europe, increased spending and cut taxes.
It worked. By early last year, within six months of the collapse of Lehman Brothers, economies were starting to recover.
The recovery has continued this year, and it has the potential to create a virtuous cycle. Higher profits and incomes can lead to more spending -- and yet higher profits and incomes. Government stimulus, in that case, would no longer be necessary.
An internal memo from White House economists to other senior aides last week noted that policy makers "necessarily tend to focus on the impediments to recovery." But, the memo argued, the economy's strengths, like exports and manufacturing, "more than make up for continued areas of weakness, like housing and commercial real estate."
That optimistic take, however, is more debatable today than it would have been a month or two month ago.
As is often the case after a financial crisis, this recovery is turning out to be a choppy one. Companies kept increasing pay and hours last month, for example, but did little new hiring. On Tuesday, the Conference Board reported that consumer confidence fell sharply this month.
And just as households and businesses are becoming skittish, governments are getting ready to let stimulus programs expire, the equivalent of cutting spending and raising taxes. The Senate has so far refused to pass a bill that would extend unemployment insurance or send aid to ailing state governments. Goldman Sachs economists this week described the Senate's inaction as "an increasingly important risk to growth."
The parallels to 1937 are not reassuring. From 1933 to 1937, the United States economy expanded more than 40 percent, even surpassing its 1929 high. But the recovery was still not durable enough to survive Roosevelt's spending cuts and new Social Security tax. In 1938, the economy shrank 3.4 percent, and unemployment spiked.
Given this history, why would policy makers want to put on another fiscal hair shirt today?
The reasons vary by country. Greece has no choice. It is out of money, and the markets will not lend to it at a reasonable rate. Several other countries are worried -- not ludicrously -- that financial markets may turn on them, too, if they delay deficit reduction. Spain falls into this category, and even Britain may.
Then there are the countries that still have the cash or borrowing ability to push for more growth, like the United States, Germany and China, which happen to be three of the world's biggest economies. Yet they are also reluctant.
China, until recently at least, has been worried about its housing market overheating. Germany has long been afraid of stimulus, because of inflation's role in the Nazis' political rise. In responding to the recent financial crisis, Europe, led by Germany, was much more timid than the United States, which is one reason the European economy is in worse shape today.
The reasons for the new American austerity are subtler, but not shocking. Our economy remains in rough shape, by any measure. So it's easy to confuse its condition (bad) with its direction (better) and to lose sight of how much worse it could be. The unyielding criticism from those who opposed stimulus from the get-go -- laissez-faire economists, Congressional Republicans, German leaders -- plays a role, too. They're able to shout louder than the data.
Finally, the idea that the world's rich countries need to cut spending and raise taxes has a lot of truth to it. The United States, Europe and Japan have all made promises they cannot afford. Eventually, something needs to change.
In an ideal world, countries would pair more short-term spending and tax cuts with long-term spending cuts and tax increases. But not a single big country has figured out, politically, how to do that.
Instead, we are left to hope that we have absorbed just enough of the 1930s lesson.

Abstract: "Exceptional government and central bank support was needed to quell the enormous uncertainty and market disruption during the crisis," said Jaime Caruana, general manager of the Bank for International Settlements, whose board includes the U.S. Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, and the European Central Bank president, Jean-Claude Trichet.

Full text: BASEL, SWITZERLAND -- An organization that brings together most of the world's major central banks said Monday that the easy money that has propped up the banking system during the financial crisis must soon be withdrawn -- even as it warned that many banks are still in fragile health.
"Exceptional government and central bank support was needed to quell the enormous uncertainty and market disruption during the crisis," said Jaime Caruana, general manager of the Bank for International Settlements, whose board includes the U.S. Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, and the European Central Bank president, Jean-Claude Trichet.
"But keeping support measures in place over a long period creates moral hazard," meaning it can encourage risky behavior, Mr. Caruana said at a news conference following the organization's annual meeting in Basel.
Many banks in Europe and the United States remain heavily leveraged and dependent on central bank support, the B.I.S. said in its annual report. Without naming specific countries, the report said that policymakers must begin raising official interest rates to avert inflation and wean banks from their dependency on the massive amounts of cash that the E.C.B., Fed and other central banks have provided.
"You may need to raise rates before your comfort zone, that is what we are saying," Mr. Caruana said.
The underlying message from Mr. Caruana, former governor of the Bank of Spain, and of the B.I.S. report seemed to be that many banks will soon face a day of reckoning. The removal of government and central bank support and a return to higher interest rates, along with public stress tests planned for European banks, will force them to write down losses on toxic assets and depend on markets for funding.
Banks will also face more regulation that, the B.I.S. report said, may crimp short-term profits but provide more reliable earnings over time. Mr. Caruana dismissed assertions by the banking industry that new regulations will cripple economic growth. The costs of new rules, which include requiring banks to hold more capital in reserve, are "low and temporary," Mr. Caruana said.
Mr. Caruana also said that he does not expect any delay in implementing new banking rules, despite signals to the contrary from the meeting of the G-20 nations in Toronto last weekend. "The only thing I read there is significant support," Mr. Caruana said. Detailed proposals will be ready by the G-20's November summit, he said, though he added that implementation of new regulations will depend on the state of the economy.
While the participants in the Toronto talks said they intended to adopt the rules by the end of 2012, they cautioned that the standards would be "phased in over a time frame that is consistent with sustained recovery and limits market disruption."
Those negotiations over what is being called Basel III are conducted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, a body of regulators that meets at the B.I.S. headquarters, but is separate from the settlements bank.
The Basel Committee, which sets standards that are then carried out by national regulators, wants to tighten the definition of what can be counted as Tier1 capital, which is the basic measure of what banks hold against the risk of future losses.
The committee also wants banks to have enough liquid assets to survive a short-term market plunge, by reducing their dependence on short-term wholesale financing.
But banks across the world have been pressing for a delay or even a rewriting of the proposed rules, in part by arguing that the new standards could hamper the global recovery.
Mario Draghi, the chairman of the Financial Stability Board, a global coordination body that works closely with the Basel Committee, said Sunday that it would be better to delay putting the standards in effect than to weaken them.
"The quality and amount of capital in the banking system must be significantly higher to improve loss absorbency and resiliency," Mr. Draghi, the governor of the Bank of Italy, wrote in a letter to the G-20 leaders.
The B.I.S. also joined the G-20 in calling for governments to reduce their deficits, arguing that solid public finances will promote economic recovery by raising confidence. "It's not just market confidence, it's also consumer confidence and investor confidence," Mr. Caruana said. "The risks of not moving rapidly in fiscal consolidation are high."
While noting that emerging markets such as China, India and Brazil have bounced back from the global recession quickly, the B.I.S. warned that they face higher inflation and other symptoms of overheating if interest rates remain low. Borrowing by consumers has risen, real estate prices are up and international investors are funneling money to emerging markets because of the better returns they offer compared with the United States, Europe and Japan.
In comments that appeared aimed at China, the report said emerging countries were unlikely to be able to resist upward pressure on their currencies by means of capital controls or intervention in money markets. "There may be no alternative to raising interest rates, allowing greater flexibility in exchange rates and reducing reliance on foreign exchange intervention," the report said.
The B.I.S. report was often critical of the banking industry, in tune with what seems to be growing frustration among central bankers toward financial institutions that engage in high-risk practices while resisting more oversight.
"The crisis exposed deficiencies in the financial sector's business model that had prevailed for several decades," the settlements bank said. Financial institutions earned high profit only by leveraging "opaque and illiquid balance sheets," the report said. "Their performance has been volatile at all times and subpar in periods of general stress."
Banks remain overly dependent on short-term funding, which can dry up abruptly in a crisis, the report warned.
The Bank for International Settlements, which provides a platform for transactions among more than 50 central banks as well as a forum for debate, has been at the forefront of calls for new rules to restrain risky practices by banks and avoid future crises.
Among other measures, the B.I.S. has called for changes to banker pay to remove incentives to make risky bets; more disclosure by banks of their holdings and trading activity; and wind-down procedures to prevent the failures of individual banks from taking down the whole system.
The report said that banks faced the expiration during the next two years of $3 trillion in bonds that they have issued. The banks will have to pay sharply higher interest rates than before the financial crisis.
"Banks that have trouble tapping new funding sources will have to shrink," the report said.
In a statement, Christian Noyer, chairman of the B.I.S. and governor of the Bank of France, also seemed to be signaling that it is time for governments to take the lead in restoring stability to the financial system.
"Over the past two years policymakers worldwide, acting in close cooperation, have succeeded in containing the financial crisis," he said in a statement. "The main tasks of the public sector now is to design policies that minimize the risks of future financial crises and promote sustainable growth."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text: The Pentagon's effort to cut more than $100 billion in administrative costs over the next several years is expected to take a new direction on Monday with proposals that could lower profits for military companies.
Industry officials said that Ashton B. Carter, the under secretary of defense for acquisition, had called a meeting with contractors and lobbyists to address ways to cut waste. In addition to trimming its own bureaucracy, the Pentagon is looking for savings in how it hands out hundreds of billions of dollars in contracts for weapons and services each year.
Mr. Carter is expected to question overhead costs built into many deals and the amount of profit on certain types of contracts, the industry officials said. Congressional auditors have long criticized the Pentagon for awarding too many contracts in which it covers all the costs and pays sizable fees even when companies have trouble performing.
At the major military companies, "everyone's apprehensive" about the meeting, said Loren B. Thompson, the chief operating officer of the Lexington Institute, a research group financed in part by the contractors.
"They're worried about the tangible impact on profits," he said. "But they're also worried about the atmospherics that are conveyed to Wall Street and how investors will react."
Cheryl Irwin, a Pentagon spokeswoman, said Sunday that Mr. Carter did not want to comment publicly in advance of the meeting.
The meeting stems from a larger push by the defense secretary, Robert M. Gates, to free up money for troops in the field. But any efforts to cut costs involving contractors could signal a downturn for the industry, which has had record profits since military spending soared after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.
Even though Mr. Gates canceled a number of prominent weapons programs last year, the department's budgets have continued to rise under President Obama, to $708 billion proposed for next year, including the costs of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.
Mr. Gates has said he would like to see the Pentagon's base budget, excluding the war costs, grow each year by 1 to 2 percent after inflation.
But health care and other personnel costs are taking up a rising share of the total, and many analysts doubt that the government will be able to sustain such increases as the nation's overall budget deficits expand.
Mr. Thompson, who is also a consultant to several military companies, said he believed that Mr. Carter wanted to get the industry's reaction before deciding on some the contracting changes.
Congressional auditors have especially criticized many of the contracts for supplies and services in the war zones as being poorly drawn by the government.
They also have questioned whether the Pentagon's contracting officers have the skills and the experience to ride herd on some of the contractors. The Pentagon sharply reduced its contracting staff during the 1990s, and the Obama administration is hiring 20,000 more people.

Abstract: Should high school graduation mean that a student is successful in first-year college courses? John B. King Jr., senior deputy state education commissioner, said. Despite the gap between the number of city students who graduate and the number who earn Regents diplomas, some educators say the change in standards is too small to cause a steep drop in graduation rates.

Full text: When the State Education Department announced five years ago that all students would soon be required to pass five tests to earn high school diplomas in New York, officials applauded themselves for raising standards.
The new requirements do not take full effect until the class of 2012 graduates. What is clear is that if they were in place today, New York City's graduation rate would almost certainly drop after years of climbing steadily.
What is not so evident, educators and testing experts say, is whether the higher bar will inspire students and schools to greatness, or merely make them lean more heavily on test-taking strategies. Nor is there agreement on whether it will actually make a difference in how students perform in high school and beyond.
Currently, the state awards two basic kinds of diplomas. The tougher one, called a Regents diploma, requires scores of at least 65 (out of 100) on five Regents exams: in English, math, science, global history and United States history. The other type, called a local diploma, requires a 65 on three of those tests, and a 55 on the other two. In two years, the local diploma will cease to exist. Students who want a diploma but have not passed all five tests by the end of senior year will have to retake the missed tests in a following year or seek a G.E.D.
If the new standards had been in place for the class of 2009, the city's graduation rate would have been roughly 45 percent, instead of the nearly 60 percent that city officials boasted of, according to city statistics. Among black and Latino students, barely more than one-third would have qualified for diplomas.
A Regents diploma is supposed to signify that a student is prepared for college. Today, most New York City graduates who enroll in an associate degree program at a City University of New York college need to take remedial courses there.
"This is the question that everyone is asking everywhere, not just in New York but nationally: Should high school graduation mean that a student is successful in first-year college courses?" John B. King Jr., senior deputy state education commissioner, said. "There isn't a state answer at the moment, and that's what we have to grapple with."
State officials are considering whether to change the testing requirements even more, to align more closely with college standards.
Nevertheless, some teachers and administrators expect state officials to make the tests easier to pass, rather than face public outrage for declining graduation rates. They note that Regents scores do not reflect the percentage of questions answered correctly, but rather the number of correct answers that state officials and testing experts determine represents proficiency in the subject, in a process known as scaling. For example, on last year's algebra exam, a student could earn a 65 by getting only 30 out of a maximum 87 points.
Despite the gap between the number of city students who graduate and the number who earn Regents diplomas, some educators say the change in standards is too small to cause a steep drop in graduation rates.
"In some cases, we're talking about the difference of two questions -- if a student manages to respond to two more questions correctly, they'll have no problem," said Colin Thomas, the principal of Bronx Regional High School.
But Mr. Thomas also said the tougher requirements might encourage students to put off taking the tests for another year to improve their chances of passing; students can take the tests at any time before graduation. "Some of this will just be about timing," he said. "We will have to make sure every kid is ready to take the test at the right moment."
Sam Decker, the principal of Bronx Guild High School, said he was far more concerned that students show proficiency in their writing than pass tests. He said the Regents test in biology, for example, simply required students to recite basic facts.
"It doesn't require much more than memorization," Mr. Decker said, adding that even memorization was a challenge for some students. "I would rather my students demonstrate that they can walk through the scientific process of crafting a hypothesis and analyze the results. That way we don't have to spend time just preparing them to regurgitate information."
As at many schools, however, teachers and administrators at Bronx Guild do prepare students for the tests. They analyze tests from previous years, which are made public, looking for which topics are asked about again and again. They say, for example, that the history tests inevitably include several questions about industrialization and the causes of the two world wars.
For a time, Mr. Decker encouraged teachers to spend more time delving into the philosophy behind the Bill of Rights, a line of inquiry that seldom leads to points on the test in United States history. But he drew back when he saw that many students were failing the exam.
Educators are also debating how the tests are graded. Teachers currently grade their own students' exams, which many critics say encourages grade inflation, particularly on tests that include essays, whose scoring is somewhat subjective. Because schools can be closed for sagging graduation rates, teachers have a stake in the scoring, and will have an even larger one two years from now.
"We've raised issues about scoring of the test for the last 10 years, but I don't see sufficient pressure for them to really examine it," said Howard T. Everson, a senior research fellow at CUNY and the chairman of a committee that advises the state on testing. "The problem is it would be expensive to do it any other way, but I don't see a plan for them to address it."
More important, Mr. Everson said, there has been little evidence that state officials are certain about what the exams really test and what their impact is.
"People have always taken the Regents as a fact of life," he said. "They were always seen as a benchmark of quality -- it has always meant something. And does it still? That's the real question."
To learn more, state officials have begun to track the success of high school students at city and state universities. They will examine, for example, how many students from each school need remediation, and how many students drop out after their first year of college.
"It's not going to be devastating to most high schools to have more students pass a few tests; they know this is coming," said John Garvey, who recently retired as the liaison between the city's Education Department and CUNY. "On the other hand, everyone is beginning to realize that a Regents diploma has very, very little to do with what it takes to do well in college."

Abstract: Unlike their predecessors, who raised interest rates in the face of financial crisis, the current leaders of the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank slashed rates and moved to support credit markets.

Full text: Recessions are common; depressions are rare. As far as I can tell, there were only two eras in economic history that were widely described as "depressions" at the time: the years of deflation and instability that followed the Panic of 1873 and the years of mass unemployment that followed the financial crisis of 1929-31.
Neither the Long Depression of the 19th century nor the Great Depression of the 20th was an era of nonstop decline -- on the contrary, both included periods when the economy grew. But these episodes of improvement were never enough to undo the damage from the initial slump, and were followed by relapses.
We are now, I fear, in the early stages of a third depression. It will probably look more like the Long Depression than the much more severe Great Depression. But the cost -- to the world economy and, above all, to the millions of lives blighted by the absence of jobs -- will nonetheless be immense.
And this third depression will be primarily a failure of policy. Around the world -- most recently at last weekend's deeply discouraging G-20 meeting -- governments are obsessing about inflation when the real threat is deflation, preaching the need for belt-tightening when the real problem is inadequate spending.
In 2008 and 2009, it seemed as if we might have learned from history. Unlike their predecessors, who raised interest rates in the face of financial crisis, the current leaders of the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank slashed rates and moved to support credit markets. Unlike governments of the past, which tried to balance budgets in the face of a plunging economy, today's governments allowed deficits to rise. And better policies helped the world avoid complete collapse: the recession brought on by the financial crisis arguably ended last summer.
But future historians will tell us that this wasn't the end of the third depression, just as the business upturn that began in 1933 wasn't the end of the Great Depression. After all, unemployment -- especially long-term unemployment -- remains at levels that would have been considered catastrophic not long ago, and shows no sign of coming down rapidly. And both the United States and Europe are well on their way toward Japan-style deflationary traps.
In the face of this grim picture, you might have expected policy makers to realize that they haven't yet done enough to promote recovery. But no: over the last few months there has been a stunning resurgence of hard-money and balanced-budget orthodoxy.
As far as rhetoric is concerned, the revival of the old-time religion is most evident in Europe, where officials seem to be getting their talking points from the collected speeches of Herbert Hoover, up to and including the claim that raising taxes and cutting spending will actually expand the economy, by improving business confidence. As a practical matter, however, America isn't doing much better. The Fed seems aware of the deflationary risks -- but what it proposes to do about these risks is, well, nothing. The Obama administration understands the dangers of premature fiscal austerity -- but because Republicans and conservative Democrats in Congress won't authorize additional aid to state governments, that austerity is coming anyway, in the form of budget cuts at the state and local levels.
Why the wrong turn in policy? The hard-liners often invoke the troubles facing Greece and other nations around the edges of Europe to justify their actions. And it's true that bond investors have turned on governments with intractable deficits. But there is no evidence that short-run fiscal austerity in the face of a depressed economy reassures investors. On the contrary: Greece has agreed to harsh austerity, only to find its risk spreads growing ever wider; Ireland has imposed savage cuts in public spending, only to be treated by the markets as a worse risk than Spain, which has been far more reluctant to take the hard-liners' medicine.
It's almost as if the financial markets understand what policy makers seemingly don't: that while long-term fiscal responsibility is important, slashing spending in the midst of a depression, which deepens that depression and paves the way for deflation, is actually self-defeating.
So I don't think this is really about Greece, or indeed about any realistic appreciation of the tradeoffs between deficits and jobs. It is, instead, the victory of an orthodoxy that has little to do with rational analysis, whose main tenet is that imposing suffering on other people is how you show leadership in tough times.
And who will pay the price for this triumph of orthodoxy? The answer is, tens of millions of unemployed workers, many of whom will go jobless for years, and some of whom will never work again.

Full text: MUMBAI, India -- The Indian government on Friday reduced popular fuel subsidies, a long-delayed change that will help policy makers reduce a big budget deficit but one that will also worsen already high inflation.
Policy makers said the government would stop subsidizing gasoline. Diesel, kerosene and natural gas would continue to receive support at a slightly lower level. India spent about $5.6 billion to subsidize fuel in the last fiscal year, which ended in March. State-owned energy companies added the equivalent of an additional $4.4 billion by selling fuel below its cost.
India and other big countries committed to eliminating energy subsidies at a Group of 20 meeting last year, but policy makers here had repeatedly put off the politically difficult change.
Heavily subsidized fuels like kerosene, for instance, are used by many poor Indians for lighting and cooking. Moreover, opposition politicians have criticized the government for not doing enough to bring down escalating prices, especially for food. Consumer prices jumped 14.4 percent in April from a year earlier.
The opposition Communist Party of India (Marxist) called the subsidy cuts a "cruel blow against the people who are already suffering."
The G-20 meeting in Toronto this weekend might have played into the timing of the decision. But the reductions in subsidies also signals that Indian leaders have become more confident about their political mandate a year after they won a new five-year term in office. The Congress Party-led government also appears to have gotten more serious about reducing the federal deficit, which is estimated to be 5.5 percent of the country's gross domestic product.
Still, policy makers are moving cautiously. Prices for diesel, kerosene and natural gas, which are the most heavily subsidized fuels, will increase only moderately and remain under government control for the time being.
By comparison, gasoline is not subsidized as much, and its retail price is already much higher than in the United States because of high taxes. Prices for it will increase 3.5 rupees a liter, or 29 cents a gallon, to about 55.7 rupees a liter, or $4.58 a gallon.
The increase in gasoline prices should bolster the profits of state-owned oil companies, which were not being fully compensated by the government for the subsidies. It should also help private energy companies like Reliance and Essar that sharply scaled back their fuel retailing businesses in recent years because they could not compete against the subsidized fuel sold by state-owned companies.
Even after the increase, analysts at Citigroup estimate that the government and state-owned oil companies will spend about $11.5 billion on fuel subsidies this fiscal year, down from a previous estimate of $16.7 billion.
Reliance Natural Resources, owned by Anil Ambani, has revised a purchase agreement for natural gas with Reliance Industries, Bloomberg News reported Friday from New Delhi.
Reliance Industries, controlled by Mukesh Ambani, Anil's brother, won a favorable ruling from the top Indian court in May on natural gas sales from the country's biggest field, which holds $38 billion worth of reserves. The estranged brothers subsequently scrapped agreements that prevented them from competing with each other in business.

Abstract: All three states, coincidentally, are considered to be on the leading edge of the nation's recovery. Since December, they have added jobs at a faster rate than the country as a whole and even led the country in the total number of jobs added in April.

Full text: A struggling economy has historically meant trouble for the president's party in midterm elections. So it comes as no surprise that Democrats are girding for a tough November.
They should be. The economy is slowly recovering but remains on its sickbed, and most signs still point to a rough cycle for the party. Political analysts expect Republicans to make gains -- possibly significant ones -- in Congress in November, threatening to retake the House and maybe even the Senate.
But digging deeper, beyond the national numbers, reveals at least a few glimmers of hope for Democrats -- still fairly distant and faint, but bright enough to get campaign strategists scanning the horizon and weighing the odds.
That is because different parts of the country are recovering at different rates -- and, in a bit of electoral good luck for the Democrats, some of the areas that are beginning to edge upward more quickly, like parts of Ohio, Pennsylvania and New York, happen to be in important battlegrounds for the House and the Senate.
"A lot of the trend lines are turning positive in many of these contested areas," said Mark Zandi, a chief economist for Moody's Analytics. "It really boils down to: Is there enough time for the trend lines to trump the still pretty difficult conditions in the minds of the voters?"
Certainly, the economy will not be the only factor voters weigh at the ballot box. There are areas that weathered the recession relatively well where Democratic incumbents are still in danger. There are also places trailing the national recovery, like Nevada and Florida, which could hurt the party.
But officials from both parties agree that the economy remains -- at least, for the moment -- the paramount concern for most voters. And studies have shown that local conditions influence the degree to which economic worries figure into voters' decisions -- a kind of Tip O'Neill rule of pocketbook voting.
A detailed examination of House and Senate seats in play, alongside state and local economic data compiled by Moody's Analytics for The New York Times, yields some surprising bits of encouragement for Democrats but also adds color to the overall daunting picture confronting the party. At the very least, any such signs of hope are certain to affect the strategies being worked out now in campaigns.
"It's too early to know how the more rapid economic improvement in parts of the country will influence voters' decisions," said Representative Chris Van Hollen, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. "But there's no doubt that voters' perception of the future of the economy will be a main factor in determining their vote."
The Times has identified 114 House seats and 17 Senate seats that are expected to be the most competitive in November. The largest numbers of closely contested elections are expected to be in Pennsylvania, New York and Ohio, where The Times projects a combined 26 competitive House races.
All three states, coincidentally, are considered to be on the leading edge of the nation's recovery. Since December, they have added jobs at a faster rate than the country as a whole and even led the country in the total number of jobs added in April. One reason is that manufacturing, a traditional backbone, has been on the rebound; another is that these states generally did not suffer as acutely as other regions from the housing boom and bust.
While much attention has been paid to the nation's stubbornly high unemployment rate, political scientists have found little correlation between that measure and midterm elections results. Instead, they have found more broad-based indicators, particularly real personal disposable per capita income, which measures the amount of money a household has after taxes and inflation, to be better gauges.
About a quarter of the House races The Times expects to be competitive in metropolitan areas that are projected by Moody's to have had positive, albeit mostly modest, after-tax personal income growth between 2009 and 2010. They include several swing districts in upstate New York that have long struggled economically but largely escaped the real estate bubble.
In New York's 24th Congressional District, for example, Representative Mike Arcuri, a Democrat, said he senses the improvement but has to be careful about how he couches it with voters.
"They just want to know there's light at the end of the tunnel," he said. "I think they're just starting to see that."
The economic forecasting company also predicts housing prices will rise in metropolitan areas connected to a fifth of the competitive House seats identified by The Times. The forecasters project three-quarters of the competitive districts will experience employment growth in their corresponding metropolitan areas between the fourth quarter of 2009 and the fourth quarter of 2010.
The picture is grimmer for Democrats when it comes to the 17 Senate races that are expected to be in play. Only one state on the list, Connecticut, is projected to have experienced disposable income growth from 2009 to 2010. On the other hand, all but one state, Nevada, are predicted by Moody's to experience job gains between the fourth quarter of 2009 and the fourth quarter of 2010.
Unfortunately for Democrats, important Senate battlegrounds like Nevada -- where the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, is fighting for his political life -- and Florida are predicted to be among the last to begin experiencing steady employment growth, with economists not forecasting consistent increases until late 2010 or early 2011.
Both states suffered the worst of the over-speculation on housing. Making matters worse for Democrats, both lived through a long, happy Sun Belt boom, so economic turmoil is a relatively new experience for residents -- and studies indicate it is such locales where economic anxiety is most likely to drive voters' decisions.
Ohio promises to be an interesting laboratory. At least eight competitive House races are expected there, as well as a hard-fought Senate race. A struggling Rust Belt state, it gained more than 37,000 jobs in April, the largest increase for the state in years. But Ohio remains a long way from replacing the roughly 400,000 jobs it has lost since 2007.
"The question is: how big are people's memories?" said James Diffley, a managing director at IHS Global Insight.
Historically, political scientists have found that voters' memories tend to be short. Larry M. Bartels, a political scientist at Princeton, has studied the impact of economic conditions on presidential elections and found that it is the second and third quarters of the election year that matter most.
In the end, however, the ultimate deciding factor will be voters' perceptions -- not how well the economy is actually doing, but how well voters believe it is doing.
With communities climbing from such dire straits, it remains to be seen whether modest economic gains will be enough.

China's Export Economy Begins Turning Inward

Abstract: Chinese officials obviously felt confident enough in the recovery to go forward with the currency shift. Besides exports, China's economic growth has depended on state-led investment, especially infrastructure building, and that too leads to big risks, some analysts say.

Links: http://findit.library.jhu.edu/resolve?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Anytimes&amp;atitle=China%27s+Export+Economy+Begins+Turning+Inward%3A+%5BForeign+Desk%5D&amp;title=New+York+Times&amp;issn=03624331&amp;date=2010-06-25&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=A.6&amp;au=Wong%2C+Edward&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=New+York+Times&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/

Full text: BEIJING -- For years, Chinese leaders looked to the millions of poor workers from the country's interior as the engine of a roaring export economy. They would move to coastal provinces, toil in factories and churn out the world's household goods.
These days, the workers are crucial for China's economy in another way: They must start buying the very products they manufacture, spending their paychecks on lipstick and lingerie, plastic lawn chairs and plasma television sets. Officials see them as the linchpin of China's move away from a lopsided economic model that relies too heavily on foreign consumption.
Some of China's top leaders, including Prime Minister Wen Jiabao, have emphasized the need for that restructuring for years, especially since the global financial crisis pummeled the export industry. But China's move this week to make its currency, the renminbi, more flexible and the authorities' apparent tolerance of recent factory strikes that have led to significant wage increases both signal that Chinese leaders could be serious about re-engineering the nation's economic model.
The currency shift brings immediate political benefits, since China will now presumably come under less pressure at the Group of 20 summit meeting this weekend. But there are important domestic considerations as well. The breaking of the renminbi's de facto peg to the dollar means the currency is likely to appreciate in value, making Chinese exports somewhat less competitive in the global marketplace but strengthening the purchasing power of Chinese consumers. Likewise, government policies to encourage wage increases for poor laborers -- there are an estimated 150 million migrant workers in cities -- could also spur consumption, if the pay increases outpace inflation.
"The central government attitude toward raising wages is undoubtedly positive because it's directly tied to boosting domestic consumption and restructuring the economy," said Liu Cheng, a scholar of labor law at Shanghai Normal University. "For a long time, wage growth has lagged behind economic growth, and that has forced China to continue to depend on exports."
Chinese leaders have little choice but to overhaul the model. For one thing, the pool of cheap labor is drying up. China's population of 15- to 24-year-olds has already peaked and will continue to shrink over the next decade, even if China were to change its one-child policy, according to projections by the United Nations. Just as important, young workers these days are no longer willing to toil under the same conditions tolerated by laborers a decade ago.
Some Chinese leaders have been vocal in recent months about the need to raise household consumption. Li Keqiang, the vice prime minister who is viewed as a likely successor to Mr. Wen, stressed that as a priority in public addresses this year. On June 1, Seeking Truth, an official journal of the Communist Party, published an article by Mr. Li in which he wrote that "increasing citizens' consumption is the key to expanding domestic demand."
Raising wages is only one of several actions the government must take if it wants to stimulate household consumption. The savings rate in China is much higher than that in Western nations, at least partly because people rely on savings to finance much of their education and health care needs. In January 2009, China announced that it intended to spend $123 billion by 2011 to set up universal health care for its 1.3 billion people, but that plan is vastly underfinanced, scholars say.
Keeping a lid on inflation is also crucial. Low wages have helped hold down the inflation rate despite years of extraordinary double-digit growth and huge government investments in projects. But in May, the consumer price indexedged up to 3.1 percent from the previous May; the government wants the average in all of 2010 to be no higher than 3 percent. That was most likely one factor that pushed the People's Bank of China to announce last Saturday that the renminbi would become more flexible.
Analysts say that a currency revaluation by itself will not necessarily make China's exports significantly less competitive or rein in China's dependence on its export industry. From mid-2005 to mid-2008, the renminbi appreciated 21 percent against the United States dollar, but China's trade surplus with the United States continued to grow by an average of 21 percent during that period. In recent months, China's exports have shown a strong recovery, with nearly 50 percent growth year-on-year in May. Chinese officials obviously felt confident enough in the recovery to go forward with the currency shift.
Besides exports, China's economic growth has depended on state-led investment, especially infrastructure building, and that too leads to big risks, some analysts say. Stimulus spending and a surge in lending by state banks during the economic crisis helped China power through the slump. But the lending spree has contributed to inflationary pressures and a soaring property market that the central government is trying to cool down.
Victor Shih, an associate professor at Northwestern University who studies the political economy of China, said a significant portion of $1.6 trillion that has been lent to companies run by local governments is likely to pile up as bad loans, posing a risk to state banks, and thus the entire economy. "There will be a big cost," he said. "China is trying to recapitalize its banks before a lot of these bad loans show up on the balance sheets."
As with export dependence, some Chinese leaders are starting to see the danger and have moved to slow bank lending.
But effective infrastructure projects are literally the road to more widespread wage increases across China, and thus greater domestic consumption. An explosion of highways and rail lines in the central interior provinces means companies are now operating more factories in those areas, where costs are lower. Some workers in the interior are seeing wages increase at the same rates as those on the coast, or at even higher rates.
Anne Stevenson-Yang, head of the Beijing office of Wedge MKI, an equity analysis firm, said her research into at least 15 companies across China showed that some in the interior had raises of up to 30 percent this year, a higher rate than those on the coasts. But absolute wages are still lower in the interior, so more and more low-margin manufacturing companies are setting up shop there, especially as provincial governments on the coast slowly push out some assembly-line factories in favor of higher-end businesses.
In theory, many laborers will no longer have to flock to the coast, and consumption in the interior will rise, leading to more uniform economic growth across China.
"Probably the factory cities and dormitories of the '80s will disappear," Ms. Stevenson-Yang said, "and one day people will think, 'Wow, what was that all about?' "

Full text: The announcement by China's central bank that it would stop pegging its currency to the dollar could be a watershed moment for the global economy -- if China really allows the value of the currency to rise.
China's cheap currency policy has not only built up enormous trade surpluses with the United States and Europe, it has become a drag on the economic recovery of other developing nations whose exports can't compete. The policy is skewing global economic management as other countries keep their exchange rates artificially low. It is building enormous financial imbalances by adding to China's huge pile of dollar reserves.
With international resentment growing, China's announcement on Saturday was clearly timed to pre-empt criticism at this weekend's summit of the world's 20 leading economies in Canada. Doubts about Beijing's sincerity were immediately raised when the central bank issued a second statement insisting a substantial appreciation of the currency, the renminbi, is "not in China's interest." Its rate policy since then suggests that any rise permitted will be very gradual.
The policy of deliberately undervaluing the renminbi has been central to China's economic success over the last two decades. But it is no longer tenable even for China's own economic health.
A substantial increase in the currency's value would help combat inflation by keeping import prices low. It would boost the buying power of Chinese workers and help ease the country to a new phase of development based on sharing more of the spoils with its workers and allowing their consumption to power further growth.
China knows how to do this. From 2005 to 2008, the central bank allowed the currency to appreciate gradually from 8.25 to about 6.83 to the dollar. That aided exporters everywhere, and China's growth did not suffer. With the global economic crisis, Beijing has slammed on the brakes and the renminbi has been stuck at about 6.83.
China is now well on the way to economic recovery. Other countries are not so fortunate. Unless China makes a firm commitment to let its currency rise, it will have a hard time managing inflationary pressures and international resentment.

Full text: JOHANNESBURG -- Africa is often depicted as a place of war, disease and poverty, with a begging bowl extended to the world. But a new report paints a much more optimistic portrait of a continent with growing national economies and an expanding consumer class that offers foreign investors the highest rates of return in the developing world.
In a report released Thursday, McKinsey & Company, the consulting firm, presented a bullish message to companies, arguing that "global businesses cannot afford to ignore the potential."
"The growth we've seen in Africa recently is much more widespread than is generally recognized," said Arend van Wamelen, an author of the report based in Johannesburg for McKinsey, which advises domestic and international companies investing in Africa. "There are a lot of underlying good things going on in the economies."
The report, titled "Lions on the Move," includes an array of arresting facts from the firm's business and economics research arm, the McKinsey Global Institute. Since 2000, 316 million people on the continent have signed up for cellphone service, more than the entire population of the United States; Africa's billion people spent $860 billion in 2008, more than India's population of 1.2 billion.
From 2000 to 2008, African economies grew at twice the pace that they did in the 1980s and 1990s. Moreover, Africa was one of only two regions -- Asia was the other -- where the collective economy rose through the global recession of 2009, by 1.4 percent.
In a clear sign of the reorientation of the economic landscape in Africa, China has provided more financing for roads, power, railways and other infrastructure in recent years than the World Bank.
And in a sign of increasing security, the number of serious conflicts in which more than 1,000 people died annually declined to an average of 2.6 a year in the 2000s from 4.8 in the 1990s, the report said.
Many advocates for democracy, the poor and people with AIDS would probably offer a less rosy take on Africa's persistent struggles, but the authors of the McKinsey report contend that the continent as a whole has made solid progress on economic fundamentals.
Often, Africa's economic growth is seen as a result of the boom in prices for its wealth of natural resources -- oil, gold, platinum and diamonds, among others. As an example of that, the continent's three largest oil producers -- Algeria, Angola and Nigeria -- earned $1 trillion in oil exports from 2000 to 2008, compared with $300 billion in the 1990s, the report found.
But the McKinsey researchers also concluded that rising commodity prices directly accounted for only about a quarter of the increase in economic growth in the 2000s.
Economic growth accelerated in 27 of the continent's 30 largest economies, resource-rich and resource-poor alike, they found. Those with great natural wealth grew at about 5.4 percent a year in the same period, while those not so well endowed grew at 4.6 percent.
McKinsey attributed Africa's economic expansion to rising commodity prices, greater political stability aided by a reduction in violent conflicts, improved macroeconomic performance and market-friendly economic reforms.
Africa's collective inflation rate fell to 8 percent after 2000, from 22 percent in the 1990s. Budget deficits declined to 1.8 percent of gross domestic product from 4.6 percent. A private sector emerged. Foreign direct investment surged to $62 billion in 2008 from $9 billion in 2000.
"Obviously, there are places in terrible shape," Mr. van Wamelen said. "We're not insensitive to that. But on the whole, if you look at the number of people who are destitute, those numbers are falling pretty drastically. The economic trickle down is there."
Some of the demographic trends praised in the report could turn out to be double-edged swords. By 2040, McKinsey projects, Africa will have 1.1 billion working-age people, more than in China or India. But even now, South Africa, one of the continent's most dynamic economies, is not growing fast enough to absorb all the young people entering the job market -- or providing them with educations that would equip them for the workplace.
Indeed, the report notes that Africa has been getting many more children into school but that it needs to do far better at giving them a quality education.
The report also noted that Africa was urbanizing at a rapid rate. It now has 52 cities with more than a million residents, more than double the number in 1990 and the same number as in Western Europe. The report acknowledged that cities could produce miserable slums, but it also maintained that they increased worker productivity, demand and investment.
"If Africa can provide its young people with the education and skills they need, this large work force could account for a significant share of both global consumption and production," the report states.

Abstract: Extra competition, particularly in the concentrated American credit card market and high-fee retail banking sector, should be encouraged. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation estimates that 60 million Americans, most of them low-income, are underserved by local community banks and wind up using usurious check cashers, payday lenders and pawnbrokers for financial services.

Full text: Many fret about Wal-Mart, but American bankers seem to have a particularly irrational fear of the retailing giant. Three years ago, opposition to Wal-Mart's application for a banking license persuaded the company to retreat. Now lawmakers are poised to use financial reform to keep it even farther at bay.
That would be a mistake. Extra competition, particularly in the concentrated American credit card market and high-fee retail banking sector, should be encouraged. Wal-Mart has the market power, loyal customer base and financial wherewithal to make that happen.
Indeed, the juggernaut, based in Arkansas, is forging ahead with plans to crack the financial services business. Banco Wal-Mart plans to open more than 160 branches in Mexico this year, nearly doubling its presence south of the border. Wal-Mart Canada Bank also opened this month. It is offering a credit card and may make loans, including mortgages.
As Wal-Mart has done with retail in America, a Wal-Mart bank could be a disciplining force in keeping down costs for customers. It could also act as an engine of credit creation for a significantly underbanked subset of the American populace.
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation estimates that 60 million Americans, most of them low-income, are underserved by local community banks and wind up using usurious check cashers, payday lenders and pawnbrokers for financial services.
Meanwhile, mergers of big banks, many blessed by regulators concerned with the safety of the financial system -- like the JPMorgan Chase takeover of Washington Mutual -- have concentrated the industry further.
This consolidation has coincided with a 10 percent annual increase since 2000 in overdraft and other fees, according to the Government Accountability Office. Meanwhile, nearly two-thirds of the domestic credit card business is controlled by three banks.
So it is no wonder that the banking industry -- in particular the community bank lobby -- is so opposed to letting Wal-Mart onto its turf. As part of the financial reform legislation, bankers have supported a three-year freeze on new applications for industrial loan corporations, the charter Wal-Mart would need.
That runs contrary to the supposed spirit of reform that seeks to empower and protect consumers. Greater competition, coupled with sounder regulatory supervision, would help accomplish that. And Wal-Mart could be its catalyst.
Wealth and Taxes
Would-be billionaires often say they are discouraged by high tax rates. For example, the private equity industry complained this week that the increase in the British tax rate on capital gains to 28 percent would damage capital formation. The latest World Wealth Report from Merrill Lynch and Cap Gemini suggests otherwise.
The research examines what used to be called rich people, who are now known as high-net-worth individuals. The cutoff is investable capital of $1 million.
The financial crisis and recession have been a little rough on those at the top of the global economic heap. From booming 2006 to busting 2009, both the headcount of millionaires and their total net worth increased by a mere 5 percent -- to 10 million and $39 trillion respectively. After accounting for inflation and a generally weak dollar, it is a loss.
They are still rich and numerous enough to be worth studying. One trend is not surprising. During the period, the global millionaire mix shifted away from the finance-intensive United States and Britain toward rapidly growing China, India and Brazil. It certainly wasn't tax rates that made the difference.
Another pattern is more surprising -- the lack of correlation between the concentration of wealth and the rate of taxes. A good measure is the ratio of those wealthy individuals to billion dollars of gross domestic product, which corrects for the larger number of millionaires in richer countries.
In that count, low-tax Switzerland leads, with a ratio of 453. Low-tax (and high government-spending) Japan is second at 323. But high-tax Germany ranks third at 263. And the ratios in lightly taxed China, Brazil and India are around 100.
Tax rates are not a crucial factor for growing millionaires. Social aspects play a role. As for economic policy, two things seem necessary. First, a high savings rate. That helps explain why Germany and Japan are ahead of Britain and the United States.
Second, time. Traditionally wealthy countries are more millionaire-rich than the nouveaux riches. But China's extraordinary savings and growth rates should enable it to catch up soon.

Full text: WASHINGTON
Ben Bernanke believes that he and his Federal Reserve colleagues have the ability to lift economic growth at their meeting this week. The Fed, he has said, "retains considerable power to expand aggregate demand and economic activity, even when its accustomed policy rate is at zero," as it is today.
Mr. Bernanke also believes that the economy is growing "not fast enough," as he recently put it. He has predicted that unemployment will remain high for years and that "a lot of people are going to be under financial stress."
Yet he has been unwilling to use his power to lift growth and reduce joblessness from near a 27-year high. Instead, Fed officials are expected to announce on Wednesday that they have left their policy unchanged, even if they acknowledge that the economy has recently weakened.
How can this be? How can Mr. Bernanke simultaneously think that growth is too slow and that it shouldn't be sped up? There is an answer -- whether or not you find it persuasive.
Above all, top Fed officials are worried that financial markets are fragile. They are not so much worried about inflation, the traditional source of Fed angst, as they are about upsetting the markets' confidence in Washington. Yes, investors remain happy to lend the United States money at rock-bottom interest rates, despite our budget deficit and all of the emergency Fed programs that will eventually need to be unwound. But no one knows how long that confidence will last.
In effect, Mr. Bernanke and his colleagues have decided to accept an all-but-certain downside -- high unemployment, for years to come -- rather than risk an even worse situation -- a market panic, a spike in long-term interest rates and yet higher unemployment. As the last few years have shown, market sentiment can change unexpectedly and sharply.
Still, you have to wonder if the Fed is paying enough attention to the risks of its own approach. They do exist. The recent data on jobless claims, consumer spending and home sales have been weak. On Tuesday, Britain announced a budget-cutting plan that will depress short-term growth there and spill over somewhat into the global economy. The necessary budget cuts in Greece and other parts of Europe won't help global growth, either.
The main historical lesson of financial crises is that governments are usually too passive. They respond in dribs and drabs, as Japan did in the 1990s and Europe did in 2008. Or they remove support too quickly, as Franklin Roosevelt did in 1937, and then the economy struggles to escape its funk.
Look around at the American economy today. Unemployment is 9.7 percent. Inflation in recent months has been zero. States are cutting their budgets. Congress is balking at spending the money to prevent state layoffs. The Fed is standing pat, too. Bond investors, fickle as they may be, show no signs of panicking.
Which seems to be the greater risk: too much action or too little?

The Fed's benchmark interest rate, which has been near zero since late 2008, determines the overnight rate at which banks lend one another money. The overnight bank rate, in turn, sets other short-term interest rates. But the benchmark rate has only an indirect effect on long-term rates. That's why the 30-year fixed mortgage rates can be near 5 percent while the Fed rate is zero.
If Mr. Bernanke and his colleagues decided to take further action, their most likely move would be to bring down long-term rates. They could do so by buying the bonds that backed longer-term loans. With lower borrowing costs, households and businesses would probably spend more money. The Fed did precisely this during the financial crisis, and the drop in rates seemed to help spending.
Last week, the San Francisco Fed released a report analyzing interest rate policy since the crisis began. The report suggested that the effective benchmark rate -- taking into account both the zero percent short-term rate and the bond purchases -- was now roughly negative 2 percent.
The most notable part of the report, however, was what it showed the effective rate should be. Based on a formula that considers past Fed policy and current levels of unemployment and inflation, the effective rate today should be negative 5 percent. In layman's terms, the report was saying that the Fed was erring on the side of timidity.
Mr. Bernanke and other Fed leaders do not quibble with these numbers. If anything, Mr. Bernanke has gone out of his way to distance himself from the presidents of some regional Fed banks who have begun publicly worrying that the Fed has pumped too much money into the economy and that inflation is about to rise. Mr. Bernanke has instead said inflation is subdued and pointed to surveys showing that economists expect it to remain so.
His worry is a different one.
In a recent appearance before the House Budget Committee, he spoke repeatedly about market confidence. Specifically, he mentioned "the potential loss of confidence in the markets" if Congress did not come up with a plan for reducing the budget deficit.
There is a direct analogy between the budget deficit and the Fed's asset holdings. Neither is sustainable. Congress needs to demonstrate that it has a plan for reducing the deficit over the long haul so that investors will be confident enough to continue lending the United States money at low rates.
The Fed, meanwhile, has to show it has a strategy for selling the trillions of dollars of assets it bought during the crisis -- without damaging the value of private investors' holdings and without, at some point, igniting inflation. "The more we buy," Donald Kohn, the Fed's vice chairman said last month, "the more assets we will ultimately need to dispose of." The more the Fed buys, the greater the risk that it will find the point at which the market becomes unnerved.
In the end, Mr. Bernanke's dilemma has no certain solution. Taking more aggressive action might have only a modest effect on spending, and nobody -- including the most passionate advocates for more government action -- can really know how long the bond markets will stay calm. The decision comes down to weighing the probabilities and the possible outcomes.
Let's just be clear about the risks and costs that the Fed has chosen. It is betting that, for once, policy makers are not underreacting to a financial crisis. And it is willing to accept a jobless rate of almost 10 percent, with all of the attendant human costs.
"About half of the unemployed have been unemployed for six months or more, which means that they are losing skills, they're losing contact with the job market," a prominent economist said at a public dinner in Washington this month. "If things go on and they simply sit at home or work very irregularly, when the economy gets back to a more normal state, they're not going to be able to find good work."
That economist happened to be Ben Bernanke, one of the few people with the power to do something about the situation.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- President Obama, whose vilification of insurers helped push a landmark health care overhaul through Congress, plans to sternly warn industry executives at a White House meeting on Tuesday against imposing hefty rate increases in anticipation of tightening regulation under the new law, administration officials said Monday.
The White House is concerned that health insurers will blame the new law for increases in premiums that are intended to maximize profits rather than covering claims. The administration is also closely watching investigations by a number of states into the actuarial soundness of double-digit rate increases.
"Our message to them is to work with this law, not against it; don't try and take advantage of it or we will work with state authorities and gather the authority we have to stop rate gouging," David Axelrod, Mr. Obama's senior adviser, said in an interview. "Our concern is that they not try and, under the cover of the act, get in under the wire here on rate increases."
The law does not grant the federal government new authority to regulate health care premiums, which remains the province of state insurance departments. But with important provisions taking effect this summer and fall, the Obama administration has repeatedly reminded insurers -- and the public -- that it will expose industry pricing to what the health secretary, Kathleen Sebelius, has called a "bright spotlight."
The White House meeting coincides with Monday's release of a survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit health policy research group, that found that premiums for the policies most recently bought by individuals had increased by an average of 20 percent.
"The survey shows that the steep increases we have been reading about over the last several months are not just extreme cases," said Drew Altman, the foundation's president.
Mr. Obama's message to insurers will serve to put the industry on notice and position the White House politically should voters start to link premium increases to the new law. With the law expected to play a significant role in the midterm elections, the president has been using his platform to sell the bill's most immediate benefits and, by extension, to defend Democrats in Congress who risked their careers to vote for it.
He will do so again Tuesday; after his private meeting, Mr. Obama will appear in the East Room, where he will highlight new regulations to protect consumers from discriminatory insurance practices, end lifetime limits on coverage and ban unjustified revocations of coverage.
Mr. Axelrod likened them to "essentially a patients' bill of rights, the strongest in history."
White House officials said Tuesday's attendees will include top executives from 13 leading health insurers, as well as Karen M. Ignagni, the president of America's Health Insurance Plans, the industry trade group. Five state insurance commissioners also are expected to attend.
The insurers have attributed this year's increases to skyrocketing medical costs and to the economic downturn, which has prompted healthier consumers to forgo health insurance, leaving a sicker and costlier pool to cover.
"Our companies are receiving rate increase requests from hospitals across the country of 40, 50 and 60 percent," said Robert Zirkelbach, a spokesman for the trade group. "That has a direct impact on the cost of health care coverage."
But a report released Monday by Health Care for America Now, a coalition that supports the new law, stressed that the growth in premiums in the first eight years of this decade had far exceeded medical inflation -- 97 percent to 39 percent.
The new law requires the health secretary to work with states to establish a process for annual reviews of "unreasonable increases in premiums." Administration officials said Monday that they were still writing regulations to define "unreasonable increases."
Mr. Obama's approach to the health insurance industry has rarely been subtle, starting with his campaign, when he spoke of his dying mother's struggle to persuade her insurer to cover her cancer treatments.
In March, with his health bill hanging by a thread in Congress, Mr. Obama ducked into a White House meeting with insurance executives to deliver a letter from an Ohio cancer survivor who had dropped her coverage after learning her premiums were rising 40 percent.
But for all of Mr. Obama's browbeating, the new health care law stopped short of giving the administration the power to reject or limit rate increases. Instead, it established the annual reviews, starting next year, and makes available $250 million in grants to states to implement the review process.
States that accept the grants must recommend whether insurers with patterns of excessive pricing should be allowed to market policies through newly created exchanges, which will help individuals and businesses shop for coverage starting in 2014. Insurers also will be required to justify increases deemed unreasonable on their Web sites.
In the closing weeks of the health care debate, the White House offered a proposal to give the health secretary authority to deny unreasonable increases. It did not make it into the final legislation, but Senate Democrats have reintroduced it as a standalone bill.
The regulatory clout of state insurance departments varies widely, with some having minimal power to block rate increases. But in recent months, several states have taken unusually assertive steps.
In California, state regulators announced that they would order independent reviews of increases being sought by four large health insurers. That move came after the department discovered miscalculations in rate requests by Anthem Blue Cross, prompting the company to withdraw its plan to raise premiums by as much as 39 percent.
In Massachusetts, the administration of Gov. Deval Patrick, a Democrat, used long-untapped power to deny 9 of 10 rate increases requested by the state's insurers, provoking a lawsuit from the industry. A court in Maine recently upheld a smaller rate increase for that state's largest insurer -- 10.9 percent instead of 18.1 percent -- that had been ordered by the insurance superintendent.
In New York, Gov. David A. Paterson, a Democrat, signed legislation this month giving the state power to block unreasonable rates. And in Pennsylvania, Gov. Edward G. Rendell, also a Democrat, announced two weeks ago that his insurance commissioner, Joel Ario, would investigate large increases by the state's biggest insurers.
"The plans are cherry-picking the best risk," Mr. Ario, who will attend the White House session, said in an interview.
The federal law, which will require that most Americans obtain insurance, includes a number of provisions intended to slow the growth of premiums. For instance, insurance companies soon will have to spend at least 80 percent of revenue from premiums on claims, as opposed to administration and profit.
Insurers have warned since early in the debate that the overhaul might result in increased premiums for many consumers. The Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation and the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found otherwise, projecting that it would have minimal effect on group premiums, which account for 83 percent of the market. Their analysis forecast that premiums for individual policies would rise faster than they would without the new law, but that the increases would largely be offset by government subsidies.
Whatever the law's ultimate effect, many of this year's most egregious rate increases were announced well before it was clear the bill would pass.

Abstract: [...] costs have already been rising this year because of demands for higher wages among Chinese workers, who are balking at the coastal jobs once coveted as a way out of rural poverty.

Full text: Embracing China's decision to let its currency move more freely, American businesses said on Monday that the move would make it easier to compete against Chinese companies and would help reduce the United States trade deficit.
They cautioned, though, that the rise in the currency, the renminbi, is expected to be gradual, even if many American economists say it is 20 to 40 percent undervalued.
SGI, a California company that makes servers and data storage equipment, looks forward to extra business.
"It's a real opportunity for SGI and other American companies to expand sales to China," said Mark Barrenechea, the chief executive. "Although this will increase some costs for American businesses that source in China, it also means that Chinese businesses can more readily afford American exports."
Trade experts said the winners would be American companies like General Electric and Caterpillar that export to China, while companies like Wal-Mart and Target that rely on China as a low-cost export platform may be squeezed by rising costs.
In fact, costs have already been rising this year because of demands for higher wages among Chinese workers, who are balking at the coastal jobs once coveted as a way out of rural poverty.
Even though Caterpillar has tractor-making factories in China to serve the local market, the company was quick to praise the country's decision, struck just days ahead of a crucial Group of 20 meeting of nations. That is because along with what it produces there, Caterpillar sells China some of its most sophisticated, and therefore expensive, American-made equipment, including giant bulldozers, large mining trucks and gas turbines.
"Presumably, a stronger currency will increase their buying power, and if their economy remains strong, that will inevitably lead to more exports," said Jim Dugan, a Caterpillar spokesman.
As China's goods become more expensive, goods produced in the West will become relatively more attractive, not just in China but around the world.
Fred P. Hochberg, chairman of the Export-Import Bank of the United States, said it was hard to predict how much China's currency increase could bolster American exports. "It depends on how they implement it, what rate of speed and how much it is really market-driven," he said.
American companies and global companies that count on China to produce goods at a low cost, however, may be hurt by the currency's rise just as they have been suffering from rising labor costs. John Frisbie, president of the United States-China Business Council, cited companies with low-end products, like apparel, shoes and toys, as among those most affected.
Wages have risen recently in China to help workers keep up with inflation and in response to labor unrest, most notably strikes at several Honda plants and 11 worker suicides at Foxconn Technology's mammoth electronics factory in Shenzhen.
Mitch Free, chairman of MFG.com, a company based in Atlanta that helps secure manufacturing for Black & Decker, Whirlpool and Motorola, said Chinese manufacturing prices had risen by 8 percent in the last year, largely because of labor costs. He expects the trend to continue.
"They're proactively giving some wage increases," Mr. Free said. "We're seeing people sending messages to the buyers, through the system, saying that they're revising a price or can only hold a price for a short time because they're anticipating wage increases."
How much American exports increase depends in part on how much China allows its currency to rise. C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, predicted that if the renminbi rose by 20 percent over the next two or three years, and if adjacent countries like Taiwan and Malaysia similarly let their currencies rise, the United States would lop $100 billion to $150 billion a year from its current account deficit and create up to one million American jobs.
"Most of that change would be in exports, not just exports to China, but to Bangladesh, Vietnam and even Mexico," Mr. Bergsten said.
Mr. Frisbie was more skeptical about the impact on the trade deficit. Neither a stronger renminbi nor higher wages would have much effect on major companies like G.E. or Boeing that have made large investments in China to sell to local consumers, he said.
For companies that make products in China for sale elsewhere, however, there will be an incentive to reconsider where their factories are.
"They're the ones who are strategizing to consider other locations," Mr. Frisbie said. "They're the companies that will be impacted most. They're looking at other places with low labor costs, like Vietnam."
Other Asian countries could well let their currencies rise along with the renminbi, reducing the potential benefit of transferring operations out of China.
Still, some companies may decide to continue diversifying their suppliers, said Hana Ben-Shabat, who oversees A. T. Kearney's global-retail index.
"Companies will spread their bets among different countries instead of being so attached to getting a large proportion of their goods out of China," she said.
She said she did not expect a wave of moves to lower-wage countries because labor costs make up only 15 to 20 percent of apparel costs. "Cost of labor in Bangladesh is way lower than China," she said, but given other costs like shipping, "the same garment could cost much more out of Bangladesh than in China."
At one big company, Li & Fung, which does work for Wal-Mart and Liz Claiborne, among others, the president, Bruce Rockowitz, said China was still attractive. "This is not the end of China, but it's the end of lower prices," he said.
Clyde Prestowitz, president of the American Strategy Institute and author of "The Betrayal of American Prosperity," said he expected no rush out of China by American companies.
"In fact, I see important guys going in, like Intel and Applied Materials," both semiconductor manufacturers, he said. "Foreign companies are obviously concerned, but I haven't seen anybody except Google talk seriously about getting out. It's a big market that's going to get bigger."

Abstract: The Congressional Budget Office, in its analysis of President Obama's budget proposals, predicts that economic recovery will reduce the annual budget deficit from about 10 percent of G.D.P. this year to about 4 percent of G.D.P. in 2014. The answer is that the budget deficit should become a priority when, and only when, the Federal Reserve has regained some traction over the economy, so that it can offset the negative effects of tax increases and spending cuts by reducing interest rates.

Full text: Spend now, while the economy remains depressed; save later, once it has recovered. How hard is that to understand?
Very hard, if the current state of political debate is any indication. All around the world, politicians seem determined to do the reverse. They're eager to shortchange the economy when it needs help, even as they balk at dealing with long-run budget problems.
But maybe a clear explanation of the issues can change some minds. So let's talk about the long and the short of budget deficits. I'll focus on the U.S. position, but a similar story can be told for other nations.
At the moment, as you may have noticed, the U.S. government is running a large budget deficit. Much of this deficit, however, is the result of the ongoing economic crisis, which has depressed revenues and required extraordinary expenditures to rescue the financial system. As the crisis abates, things will improve. The Congressional Budget Office, in its analysis of President Obama's budget proposals, predicts that economic recovery will reduce the annual budget deficit from about 10 percent of G.D.P. this year to about 4 percent of G.D.P. in 2014.
Unfortunately, that's not enough. Even if the government's annual borrowing were to stabilize at 4 percent of G.D.P., its total debt would continue to grow faster than its revenues. Furthermore, the budget office predicts that after bottoming out in 2014, the deficit will start rising again, largely because of rising health care costs.
So America has a long-run budget problem. Dealing with this problem will require, first and foremost, a real effort to bring health costs under control -- without that, nothing will work. It will also require finding additional revenues and/or spending cuts. As an economic matter, this shouldn't be hard -- in particular, a modest value-added tax, say at a 5 percent rate, would go a long way toward closing the gap, while leaving overall U.S. taxes among the lowest in the advanced world.
But if we need to raise taxes and cut spending eventually, shouldn't we start now? No, we shouldn't.
Right now, we have a severely depressed economy -- and that depressed economy is inflicting long-run damage. Every year that goes by with extremely high unemployment increases the chance that many of the long-term unemployed will never come back to the work force, and become a permanent underclass. Every year that there are five times as many people seeking work as there are job openings means that hundreds of thousands of Americans graduating from school are denied the chance to get started on their working lives. And with each passing month we drift closer to a Japanese-style deflationary trap.
Penny-pinching at a time like this isn't just cruel; it endangers the nation's future. And it doesn't even do much to reduce our future debt burden, because stinting on spending now threatens the economic recovery, and with it the hope for rising revenues.
So now is not the time for fiscal austerity. How will we know when that time has come? The answer is that the budget deficit should become a priority when, and only when, the Federal Reserve has regained some traction over the economy, so that it can offset the negative effects of tax increases and spending cuts by reducing interest rates.
Currently, the Fed can't do that, because the interest rates it can control are near zero, and can't go any lower. Eventually, however, as unemployment falls -- probably when it goes below 7 percent or less -- the Fed will want to raise rates to head off possible inflation. At that point we can make a deal: the government starts cutting back, and the Fed holds off on rate hikes so that these cutbacks don't tip the economy back into a slump.
But the time for such a deal is a long way off -- probably two years or more. The responsible thing, then, is to spend now, while planning to save later.
As I said, many politicians seem determined to do the reverse. Many members of Congress, in particular, oppose aid to the long-term unemployed, let alone to hard-pressed state and local governments, on the grounds that we can't afford it. In so doing, they are undermining spending at a time when we really need it, and endangering the recovery. Yet efforts to control health costs were met with cries of "death panels."
And some of the most vocal deficit scolds in Congress are working hard to reduce taxes for the handful of lucky Americans who are heirs to multimillion-dollar estates. This would do nothing for the economy now, but it would reduce revenues by billions of dollars a year, permanently.
But some politicians must be sincere about being fiscally responsible. And to them I say, please get your timing right. Yes, we need to fix our long-run budget problems -- but not by refusing to help our economy in its hour of need.

Full text: HONG KONG -- A day after announcing that it would allow a more flexible currency, China said on Sunday that any appreciation in its value would be gradual, and it set the renminbi's value in early trading on Monday at the same level as it traded on Friday.
By early afternoon, the renminbi had climbed 0.27 percent in Shanghai trading. This was the first time that the Chinese government has allowed such a jump in intraday trading since before it repegged the renminbi to the dollar almost two years ago.
The central bank's statement on Sunday and the decision on Monday morning to leave the currency unchanged represented clear attempts to reassure the Chinese people that there would not be a disruptive change.
The central bank's statement on Sunday afternoon coincided with signs of a negative reaction in China, where many view a weak currency and strong exports as symbols of national sovereignty. The initial announcement on Saturday evening that China would allow its currency, the renminbi, to fluctuate drew caustic postings on Chinese Internet sites, like this one on Sohu.com: "I didn't imagine I would see the day when China would submit to America and agree to appreciation of the renminbi."
Postings criticizing the government's announcement seemed to disappear almost as quickly as they appeared, an indication that government censors were active.
Asian stock markets rose on Monday morning, with the Hang Seng up 2.85 percent, as investors seemed to conclude that China's willingness to act on the currency could reduce the likelihood of trade frictions with the United States.
But China's determination to limit the rate at which the renminbi rises against other currencies, particularly the dollar, together with its decision to hold the currency unchanged on Monday morning at 6.8275 to the dollar, made further friction with the United States Congress more likely.
Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, responded to the Chinese statement on Sunday and the unchanged value of the renminbi at the market opening on Monday morning by promising to move ahead as quickly as possible on legislation that could lead to restrictions on Chinese imports.
"China's conflicting statements over the weekend gave support to both optimists and pessimists in regard to China's desire to let its currency appreciate," he said. "Today's market opening is an indication that those of us who have been pessimists are right."
When world leaders gather next weekend for meetings in Toronto, enthusiasm about China's new currency policy may be tempered by Beijing's public caution that any changes will be slow and modest.
The central bank, the People's Bank of China, said on Sunday that it was determined to "keep the renminbi exchange rate at a reasonable and balanced level of basic stability."
A stronger renminbi would make Chinese goods more expensive in foreign markets, providing relief for American, European and Japanese companies and workers who have struggled to compete with low-price exports from China.
But the Chinese government has long been wary of letting the currency move too quickly, for fear that this would lead to mass layoffs and social instability at export factories in coastal areas.
The currency issue is heavily freighted with diplomatic ramifications. China's exchange rate has been a central point of tension between Beijing and Washington, and American officials have been persistent in pushing for a change. Though the Obama administration has sought to minimize a public confrontation with China, it could be put in a difficult position if the renminbi barely moves against the dollar.
The United States Treasury Department had no direct response to the latest Chinese statement. A spokeswoman for the agency said that Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner's comments on Saturday evening remained the American position. Mr. Geithner had said then that "this is an important step, but the test will be how far and how fast they let the currency appreciate."
In April, Mr. Geithner postponed the release of a twice-yearly report to Congress on whether China was manipulating the value of its currency. The Treasury has made no further decision on what to do about that report, an American official said Saturday evening, insisting on anonymity because of the delicacy of currency policy.
The issue has become a tricky one internally for the Chinese government. While China still muzzles its media through censorship, public opinion expressed on the Internet has become an increasingly influential force.
Even though some Chinese economists and most Western economists say that a stronger renminbi is clearly in China's best economic interests -- because it would help China fight inflation by making imports cheaper -- many Chinese see the issue mainly in terms of a rivalry with the United States.
When President Obama imposed steep tariffs on tire imports from China in September, the country's Commerce Ministry initially issued a tepid response.
But faced with furious criticism on the Internet, the ministry changed its position a day later and announced in an angry statement that it would retaliate by taking steps to restrict some American exports to China.
The central bank's statement on Sunday was issued only in Chinese and was clearly intended for domestic consumption. In contrast, its announcement on Saturday was issued almost simultaneously in Chinese and English.
The statement said that the central bank was returning to its practice from 2005 to 2008 of setting the value of the renminbi relative to a basket of currencies, and not just linking it to the dollar.
The renminbi rose 21 percent against the dollar during those three years, including a one-time jump of 2 percent when the policy was announced in July 2005. But after that one-time increase, the renminbi barely rose for months.
China informally repegged the renminbi at about 6.827 to the dollar in July 2008, as the world economy and financial system began to deteriorate rapidly. The government has kept the value of the renminbi unchanged against the dollar since then by buying hundreds of billions of dollars and euros each year in currency markets, selling renminbi to do so.
To finance those purchases, the Chinese government has been borrowing the equivalent of nearly one-tenth of the country's economic output each year.
Most of this borrowing has come from China's state-controlled banking system, one of several reasons that lending has been squeezed to the country's small and midsize businesses.
Investment bank economists in Hong Kong predicted over the weekend that China would allow the renminbi to crawl higher against the dollar by no more than 3 percent by year-end. They pointed out that the renminbi, through its link to the dollar, had risen 15 percent against the euro in the last two months as Europe struggled with debt problems.
The Chinese central bank also said on Sunday that it would not let the value of the renminbi "overshoot," an economic term for a currency's rising or falling so fast that it passed whatever level might be justified by long-term economic fundamentals. The central bank gave no indication of what it thought a sustainable level would be.
The International Monetary Fund concluded in a report on China last summer that the renminbi was significantly undervalued, a term the agency reserves for currencies that are more than 20 percent below where market forces would normally set them, according to people who have seen the report.
But China's trade surplus has narrowed in recent months, even turning into a small deficit in March. This has prompted Western economists to suggest that the undervaluation may have narrowed somewhat as demand in China for imports increased.
Zoe Zhang, the sales manager at Dongguan Wellcom Electronics, which makes portable CD players in Dongguan, China, said on Sunday that her company was ready for the renminbi to move gradually.
"Last time the government appreciated the renminbi, we were all caught by surprise," she said. "But this time, we have been expecting the renminbi to appreciate since April."

Full text: WITH each new model introduction, automakers take pains to point out how much they have done to reduce their vehicles' negative effects on the environment. A rundown of the advances can involve almost every aspect of the car's design and production: carbon dioxide output has been cut; paint application has changed to a water-based process; recycling and waste reduction at the factory has been improved to a point where nothing goes to a landfill.
But when it comes to tires, there has been far less to talk about.
Efforts to burnish the eco-friendliness of tires are growing, though, with an emphasis on reducing the use of raw materials -- particularly the five to 10 gallons of petroleum ingredients needed to manufacture a tire.
In recent years, the notion of making tires greener has mostly referred to the improvements in fuel economy that result from reducing their rolling resistance -- usually through the use of special rubber formulations and, of course, by assuring that proper inflation pressures are maintained.
The potential gains are substantial. When considering the environmental friendliness of a tire over its full lifespan, the effect on gas mileage actually does more to determine the tire's total carbon footprint than the choices of raw materials that go into making it.
"We found that 86 percent of the tire's environmental impact revolves around how it affects fuel consumption," said Forrest Patterson, technical director for passenger car and light truck tires at Michelin North America. "Only 12 percent of the carbon dioxide emissions associated with tires arise from the raw materials and manufacturing."
Tire makers say that fuel economy improvements of 4 to 8 percent over conventional tires are typical for these energy-saving designs. The low-rolling-resistance designs use silica-based mineral fillers, rather than just the standard carbon-black reinforcing fillers, to reduce friction.
When the auto industry sprang to life early in the 20th century, tires were made from natural rubber derived from a renewable source, the latex sap of rubber trees. Over the years, the demand for tires that delivered better performance at a lower price inspired makers to add artificial ingredients -- synthetic rubber and special additives that chemists cooked up from crude oil -- to the mix.
A century later, the research laboratories at several tire makers are making progress toward reversing the trend of increased petroleum content. One of the first to pursue this path was Sumitomo Rubber Industries, which has a global alliance with Goodyear in the Dunlop brand, for the Enasave tire it introduced in Japan in 2006. Among other changes, Sumitomo engineers substantially reduced the amount of petrochemicals by cutting the amount of synthetic rubber in half, to 11 percent of the tire's composition from about 22 percent.
A company spokesman, Masatoshi Hayashi, said that the replacement material was a chemically modified natural rubber, chosen to offset the tendency of tires with a high natural rubber content to have poor traction in braking and cornering. To overcome this problem, the engineers altered the rubber chemically to produce a rubber compound with better grip in hard driving.
Sumitomo also cut back the amount of carbon black filler (usually produced from oil, coal or charcoal) in the Enasave's tread compound while increasing the amount of fuel-saving silica filler, Mr. Hayashi said. Vegetable processing oil was substituted for its petroleum equivalent, and the compounds were reinforced with fibers made from plant cellulose.
Sumitomo has continued development. In 2008, the company introduced a prototype Enasave tire using ingredients that were 97 percent nonpetroleum-based, and by 2013 it hopes to market a new tire line that contains no petrochemicals at all.
Engineers at Yokohama Tire, working toward a similar goal, have come up with tires that are 80 percent petroleum-free, the company's director of technical services, Dan Guiney, said. The Yokohama dB Super E-spec, introduced in Japan in 2007, uses chemically modified natural rubber and a processing oil that is derived from orange peels. The peels are shipped from orange juice factories near the tire plant in Japan.
In steady driving conditions, the orange oil compound works to reduce rolling resistance by about a fifth over conventional treads, Mr. Guiney said, but in cornering and braking maneuvers it quickly generates heat that softens the rubber tread to deliver better grip. The orange oil-infused tire went on sale in the United States last year, and the same technology is used in Yokohama's Advan ENV-R1 racing slick, which is the specified tire for sports car roadracing series.
A nonpetroleum oil -- this one more commonly found in the kitchen -- has also become an ingredient in Michelin's tires. The Primacy MXM4 all-weather tire, supplied as original equipment on several Mercedes-Benz and Infiniti models, uses sunflower oil in its formulation for improved traction at low temperatures and shorter braking distances in the wet.
Tire companies are investigating more speculative ways to use sustainable and renewable rubber formulations, including latex derived from alternative sources, said Harold J. Herzlich, a tire engineering and chemistry consultant. Lesser-known plants like guayule, a desert shrub, and Russian dandelion, the central Asian version of our lawn weed, could one day help the tire industry protect itself from the uncertain supplies and fluctuating prices of natural rubber and crude oil.
Goodyear has taken a different approach to dealing with these matters. Researchers there developed a method to produce synthetic rubber by modifying isoprene, a hydrocarbon molecule that is a byproduct of petroleum refining. Changes in oil refinery practices have reduced the availability of this raw material, however, leading the company to look for alternatives.
In 2007, Goodyear entered into a research collaboration with an industrial biotechnology company, Genencor, to use engineered micro-organisms to produce isoprene. Genencor scientists have since succeeded in developing a product that the company calls BioIsoprene, which it says is chemically identical to petroleum-based isoprene.
"The cells ferment sustainable carbohydrates into isoprene in a processing vat," said Rich LaDuca, senior director of business development at Genencor, which is a division of Danisco, a Denmark-based maker of food ingredients. "But since isoprene is volatile, it bubbles out of the broth as a gas, which results in a very pure, high-yield product."
At this point, only a handful of prototype tires have been made, but Genencor is preparing to build a pilot plant in 2011 to brew more BioIsoprene, which it plans to sell to Goodyear and the rest of the tire industry. Goodyear says it expects to have tires suitable for road testing in mid-2011.
Elsewhere, researchers at Oregon State University have been working with an organic substance that can be made from various plant fibers, microcrystalline cellulose, which could partly replace silica as a reinforcing filler.
Silica filler is a costly, sophisticated material that requires a lot of energy to produce. The Oregon team successfully replaced as much as 12 percent of the silica used in low-rolling-resistance tires without degrading performance. More research is needed to confirm the long-term durability of these tire formulations.
Somewhat more subtle is the effect of new production machines that can hold much closer manufacturing tolerances, Mr. Herzlich said. As tire plants retool, new equipment lets them fabricate tires with much greater precision, which saves weight because only the required materials are included in the tire.
"If you take a half ounce out of a tire it saves a tremendous amount of fuel because it makes it easier to rotate the wheel," he said.
Efforts are growing in the meantime to recycle a greater fraction of the estimated 300 million tires that domestic drivers discard each year. "More and more of the recycled tire rubber is reprocessed and reused for many purposes," Mr. Herzlich said. "And some of these recycled materials are reused in tires."

Full text: HONG KONG -- China announced on Saturday evening that it would allow greater flexibility in the value of its currency, a move that could deflect growing international criticism of its economic policies and defuse one of the greatest sources of tension between Beijing and Washington.
The statement, by China's central bank, was the clearest sign yet that the country would allow its currency to appreciate gradually against the dollar. World leaders are due to meet next week in Canada for economic talks, and China's currency policies had appeared a certain source of conflict.
The United States has been leading a chorus of countries urging China to let its currency fluctuate. Many members of Congress believe China's exchange rate policy gives it an unfair trade advantage, and a movement has been growing to take retaliatory trade action if China did not make an adjustment.
President Obama and the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, immediately praised China's action. "China's decision to increase the flexibility of its exchange rate is a constructive step that can help safeguard the recovery and contribute to a more balanced global economy," Mr. Obama said in a statement. The European Commission also said it supported the move.
But it remains to be seen whether the move will significantly rebalance the global trade picture. The People's Bank of China was cautious in its statement about how far its currency, the renminbi, might fluctuate, warning explicitly that "the basis for large-scale appreciation of the RMB exchange rate does not exist." Chinese officials said the renminbi would move in relation to an unspecified basket of currencies, not just the dollar. Experts said that depending on how the system was designed, China could avoid rapid fluctuations.
Mr. Geithner alluded to this in a statement, saying, "This is an important step, but the test will be how far and how fast they let the currency appreciate."
The first sign of how much currency appreciation will be tolerated is likely to come Monday morning, when the Chinese government will set the initial trading band for the value of the renminbi in Shanghai trading.
China has kept its currency value low since mid-2008 by pegging it to that of the dollar and not letting it fluctuate. Any trend in the renminbi's value would have been higher without the peg, making China's goods more expensive to foreign consumers and possibly slowing the country's export-based economy.
In its statement Saturday, the central bank said that the Chinese economy was strengthening after the crisis and that it was "desirable to proceed further with reform" of the currency. Tellingly, the announcement was made almost simultaneously in Chinese and in English, a rare occurrence, and Chinese officials advised foreign governments beforehand that they were about to take a new stance on currency policy, according to an American official.
Though China said its action was based on the interests of its own economy, it has been under rising pressure from the United States, the European Union, Brazil and India. Mr. Obama had held repeated conversations with President Hu Jintao over the last year or so, the most recent of which was two weeks ago, and Mr. Geithner traveled to China for meetings last month.
China has handled currency policy gingerly, fearing that its people might see appreciation as a step taken in response to foreign pressure that might not be in the national interest.
For Mr. Obama, China's currency has been a particularly sticky problem. He also has been leaning on Beijing to help contain the nuclear programs of Iran and North Korea, to act as one of the main engines for the world economy, and to moderate its efforts to gain exclusive access to raw materials around the world needed to fuel China's huge growth.
But Mr. Obama's leverage has been minimal, and in the end it may have been the threat of a Congressional bill's protectionist actions against Chinese products that convinced Beijing that it had to begin to free its currency.
That threat had been gaining ground in Congress among lawmakers convinced that China was keeping its currency value artificially low to the detriment of the American economy.
"China's currency practice has cost American jobs and hurt American ranchers, farmers and small businesses," Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana and the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said in a statement Saturday. "Today's announcement is a welcome first step to help keep American businesses competitive and create more American jobs."
Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, however, cautioned that unless China gave further detail to its plan, "we will have no choice but to move forward with our legislation."
If the renminbi were to rise significantly, goods from the United States and other countries could eventually start displacing Chinese exports. That could help fuel economic growth in many of China's trading partners, while braking growth in China, which has been expanding so fast that inflation is now accelerating.
Rising wages after recent labor unrest, combined with a stronger currency, may also make China a more attractive consumer market for international companies. But this could help Europe more than America, whose exports to China have been weak and concentrated in a few categories like aircraft, turbines and soybeans, while European companies have been more successful in selling high-end consumer goods there.
For China, a stronger renminbi will increase the buying power of its consumers and could make gasoline and other imported commodities seem less expensive. Faced with spreading labor unrest, particularly in the auto industry, the government has started to make an energetic effort to improve the standard of living of industrial workers.
But many economists inside and outside China have argued that currency appreciation is in China's interest most of all. The country has been spending nearly one-tenth of its annual economic output to buy Treasury notes and bonds and other foreign securities while printing and selling renminbi, all in an effort to prevent the renminbi from rising against the dollar.
The renminbi has already risen with the dollar by 15 percent against the euro in the last two months. That has made Chinese officials nervous about the future competitiveness of Chinese sales to Europe, the biggest market for Chinese exports.
Cui Tiankai, a vice foreign minister, said on Friday that the value of the renminbi was not a subject for global discussion, the latest in a series of remarks by Chinese officials indicating strong nationalistic sensitivities about currency policy.
But people familiar with Chinese currency policy making have been saying for two months that the Chinese leadership agreed in early April to a change of direction. A devastating earthquake in western China in mid-April followed by worries about economic turmoil in Europe delayed action on the decision.

Full text: CORRECTION APPENDED
Many states are acknowledging this year that they have promised pensions they cannot afford and are cutting once-sacrosanct benefits, to appease taxpayers and attack budget deficits.
Illinois raised its retirement age to 67, the highest of any state, and capped the salary on which public pensions are figured at $106,800 a year, indexed for inflation. Arizona, New York, Missouri and Mississippi will make people work more years to earn pensions. Virginia is requiring employees to pay into the state pension fund for the first time. New Jersey will not give anyone pension credit unless they work at least 32 hours a week.
"We can't afford to deny reality or delay action any longer," said Gov. Pat Quinn of Illinois, adding that his state's pension cuts, enacted in March, will save some $300 million in the first year alone.
But there is a catch: Nearly all of the cuts so far apply only to workers not yet hired. Though heralded as breakthrough reforms by state officials, the cuts phase in so slowly they are unlikely to save the weakest funds and keep them from running out of money. Some new rules may even hasten the demise of the funds they were meant to protect.
Lawmakers wanted to avoid legal battles or fights with unions, whose members can be influential voters. So they are allowing most public workers across the country to keep building up their pensions at the same rate as ever. The tens of thousands of workers now on Illinois's payrolls, for instance, will still get to retire at 60 -- and some will as young as 55.
One striking exception is Colorado, which has imposed cuts on its current workers, not just future hires, and even on people who have already retired. The retirees have sued to block the reduction.
Other states with shrinking funds and deep fiscal distress may be pushed in this direction and tempted to follow Colorado's example in the coming years. Though most state officials believe they are legally bound to shield current workers from pension cuts, a Colorado victory could embolden them to be more aggressive.
Colorado pruned a 3.5 percent annual pension increase to 2 percent, concluding that was the fastest way to revive its pension fund, which was projected to run out of money by 2029. The cut may sound small, but it produces big results because it goes into effect immediately. State plans vary widely, but many have other costly features, like subsidized early-retirement benefits, which could likewise be trimmed for existing workers.
Despite its pension reform, Illinois is still in deep trouble. That vaunted $300 million in immediate savings? The state produced it by giving itself credit now for the much smaller checks it will send retirees many years in the future -- people who must first be hired and then, for full benefits, work until age 67.
By recognizing those far-off savings right away, Illinois is letting itself put less money into its pension fund now, starting with $300 million this year.
That saves the state money, but it also weakens the pension fund, actually a family of funds, raising the risk of a collapse long before the real savings start to materialize.
"We're within a few years of having some of the pension funds run out of money," said R. Eden Martin, president of the Commercial Club of Chicago, a business group that has been warning of a "financial implosion" for several years. "Funding for the schools is going to be cut radically. Funding for Medicaid. As these things all mount up, there's going to be a lot of outrage."
Joshua D. Rauh, an associate professor of finance at Northwestern University who studies public pension funds, predicts that at the current rate, Illinois's pension system could run out of money by 2018. He believes the funds of other troubled states -- including New Jersey, Indiana and Connecticut -- are also on track to run out of money in less than a decade, unless they make meaningful changes.
If a state pension fund ran out of money, the state would be legally bound to make good on retirees' benefits. But paying public pensions straight out of general revenue would be ruinous. In Illinois's case, it would consume about half the state's cash every year, bringing other vital state services to a standstill.
Mr. Rauh said he thinks any state caught in that trap would have little choice but to seek a federal bailout. Bigger pension contributions and higher taxes can go only so far.
Many state officials, hoping for a huge recovery in the markets, say that such projections are too pessimistic, and that cutting benefits for future workers must suffice, given laws and provisions in state constitutions that make membership in a state pension fund a contractual relationship that cannot be breached.
Lawyers, though, are raising the possibility that those laws are being misinterpreted.
"It makes no sense to suggest that an employee who works for the state for a single day has acquired a right to have future pension benefits calculated for the next 20 to 40 years under whatever method was in effect on that single first day of service," states a legal memorandum prepared for the Commercial Club of Chicago, which is concerned that a public pension collapse would badly damage the city's business climate.
The club's members include senior executives of big companies, like Boeing, Aon, Kraft, Motorola and I.B.M., that have frozen pensions or slowed the rates at which their workers build up benefits.
Some of those cuts set off titanic battles. The most famous was at I.B.M., which changed its pension plan just when many of its older workers were about to earn sharply higher retirement benefits. Aggrieved workers sued, but after a long battle, a federal appellate court found that the cuts were legal.
"An employer is free to move from one legal plan to another legal plan, provided that it does not diminish vested interests," or the benefits workers have already earned, wrote Chief Judge Frank H. Easterbrook of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago. He did not distinguish between corporate employers and states.
Colorado is basing its legal defense, in part, on a 1961 state supreme court ruling that said pension cuts for current workers were allowed if "actuarially necessary," and will argue that it applies to retirees as well. Other states may not have such legal tools.
In California, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has gone a different route, bargaining with the 12 unions that represent public employees. Last week four of them agreed to let the state cut its own contributions by requiring current workers to pay sharply more for the same pensions. The workers will contribute 10 percent of their pay, in some cases double the previous rate, to the state pension fund. Some other states are raising employee contributions as well, though less sharply.
In New Jersey, the administration of Gov. Christopher J. Christie recently imposed pension cuts on future hires, but has been quietly looking into whether it could also reduce the benefits that current employees expect to accumulate in the coming years.
"Can they change the benefit formula going forward? Sure. It's not etched in stone," said Edward Thomson III, an actuary and trustee of the New Jersey pension system who was asked to offer an opinion on whether New Jersey could adopt the federal pension law -- the one that covers companies -- as its governing statute.
A state assemblyman, Declan J. O'Scanlon Jr., recently introduced a bill to ratchet back a 9 percent pension increase that the state gave most workers in 2001.
"I think this will pass constitutional muster," Mr. O'Scanlon said. "Otherwise, I fear the whole system will fall apart. Nine years -- we're out of money."
PAYBACK TIME: Untouchable Benefits; Articles in this series are examining the consequences of, and efforts to deal with, growing public and private debts.
Correction: June 27, 2010, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Sunday about the ways in which states are trying to control the cost of their pension plans described a pension cap in Illinois incorrectly. The cap applies to the annual salary upon which pensions will be based (for employees hired after Jan. 1, 2011, the cap is $106,800, indexed for inflation). The pension itself will not be capped at that amount.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Lockheed Martin is negotiating to cut the price for the next group of its new F-35 fighter planes to at least 20 percent less than Pentagon officials projected last fall, Robert J. Stevens, the chief executive, said Thursday.
The company, which has been under pressure because of costly delays, is likely to build those planes under a contract with a fixed price, Mr. Stevens said. He said Lockheed could earn bonuses for meeting production milestones.
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates recently revamped the F-35 program and removed the general in charge, after long delays caused the Pentagon's projected costs to soar by 64 percent to $382 billion for 2,457 planes.
Mr. Stevens told reporters that the contract would start a transition to fixed prices for the stealth planes two years earlier than planned. He would not say what that price was likely to be for the next group of 32 planes.
But he said Lockheed was confident enough that it was regaining control of the F-35 program, the Pentagon's largest, to start bearing more of the risk instead of leaving the federal government obligated to cover any cost increases.
Mr. Stevens also said that Lockheed, the world's largest military contractor, had begun to trim spending throughout the company in recognition of "the new reality we face," with military budgets tightening in response to economic woes.
To reinforce the need to cut costs, Mr. Stevens said that he would not attend one of the industry's most lavish promotional events, the Farnborough International Airshow outside London, next month. He said Lockheed would send only half as many people as usual.
Bruce L. Tanner, Lockheed's executive vice president and chief financial officer, said in an interview that it could save hundreds of millions of dollars through the cost-cutting, which began in February.
Last month Mr. Gates also called for cuts in the Pentagon bureaucracy to free more money for troops in the field.
The Air Force, the Navy and the Marines are all buying their own versions of the F-35, known as the Joint Strike Fighter. Eight other nations have invested in developing the F-35 and could buy hundreds of the planes.
Mr. Stevens said on Thursday that the $382 billion estimate over 25 years "shows the potential" if nothing changed in the program. But, he said, "we're determined to beat the government cost estimate."
The Pentagon has already ordered 31 of the planes. The contract now being negotiated would cover 32 more.
Not counting the research and development costs, the Pentagon recently projected that the 2,457 planes could cost an average of $92.4 million before adjusting for inflation, compared with an estimate of $50 million in 2002.
Mr. Stevens said that if the Pentagon kept buying the planes at the planned pace, Lockheed believed it could bring the cost down, by 2014 to 2015, to a level comparable to updated and fully loaded versions of older fighters. That would mean reducing the price of each F-35 to $65 million or less.

Full text: FRANKFURT -- Less government spending will equal more economic growth, the European Central Bank asserted Thursday in a report, in an effort to keep up the pressure on less-troubled countries like Germany to cut their budgets.
Previous budget-cutting by countries including Ireland, the Netherlands and Finland led to faster growth fairly quickly, according to an analysis in the central bank's monthly bulletin for June that appeared to reflect the thinking of members of the bank's executive board.
In recent weeks the European Central Bank president, Jean-Claude Trichet, as well as presidents of national central banks have been urging governments -- which only months ago were starting cash-for-clunkers programs and other costly attempts to stimulate growth -- to move in the opposite direction.
"Sustainable growth is not possible without healthy public finances," the Bank of Finland governor, Erkki Liikanen, said Thursday in a statement that echoed Mr. Trichet and other central bank policy makers. While cuts in government spending might temporarily slow growth, Mr. Liikanen said, "the longer-term impact will be positive."
The United States Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, is among those who have questioned whether austerity drives by Germany and France could undercut growth. Many economists have also expressed concern that too much fiscal prudence could hurt Europe's economic recovery.
Adding to pressure on countries to cut spending, the bank's monthly bulletin also contained a report saying that if obligations like derivatives were included government debt was much higher than previously thought.
According to the method used by the European Union, member countries' total debt amounts to 79 percent of gross domestic product, already well over the limit of 60 percent agreed to by treaty. But under a broader definition of debt, the ratio is 92 percent, the central bank said.
The central bank cited several academic studies to justify the counterintuitive claim that fiscal austerity would help Europe grow more quickly. "Although fiscal consolidation may imply costs in terms of lower economic growth in the short run," the report said, "the longer-run beneficial effects of fiscal consolidation are undisputed."
Consumer confidence rises if citizens believe government finances are on a solid footing, the report said, and businesses pay lower risk premiums when they borrow money.
Eric Chaney, chief economist at the AXA Group in Paris, said that the central bank's assertion was probably true for some countries but not all. In Germany, where the fast-aging portion of the population is concerned about inflation and about whether the government will be able to pay their pensions, the austerity program might indeed bolster confidence, Mr. Chaney said.
"It makes a lot of sense to start gaining credibility on the state of public finances in the long term," he said. "At a certain point you have to start doing it."
But he questioned whether Spain should be radically cutting spending when it needed to be retraining workers so the economy could shift away from an overreliance on construction. Spain faces problems refinancing its government bonds in coming months, but the overall debt is only half that of Greece and the country is not in danger of going bankrupt, analysts say.
"The markets are very skeptical about the consequences of a large fiscal adjustment in Spain, which I share," Mr. Chaney said. "I'm not sure one size fits all."

Abstract: Most economists estimate that the Fed will increase the federal funds rate sooner.

Full text: Consumer prices fell in May for the second consecutive month, largely because of the lower cost of gasoline, the government reported on Thursday.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics said that seasonally adjusted consumer prices fell 0.2 percent last month, after a decline of 0.1 percent in April. The drop was almost entirely the result of lower energy prices -- gasoline fell 5.2 percent in May, the largest decline this year.
The core Consumer Price Index, however, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose slightly in May, by 0.1 percent. That core figure was flat in April and March, but the May increase was the second for the year. Prices for housing, used cars, apparel and medical care all rose last month, the statistics showed.
The figures suggest that, for now, inflation is tame, well below the Federal Reserve's unofficial target of about 2 percent. The Fed's policy committee is set to meet for two days next week.
"The Fed has got the flexibility to focus very firmly on growth," said David Semmens, a United States economist for Standard Chartered Bank. "Inflation is definitely not a concern in the short or medium term."
Investors and economists will be closely monitoring the Fed meeting for any change in the language of the statement on rates. The chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, told the House Budget Committee last week that the economy was still in a recovery mode and needed support.
Given the high unemployment and low inflation, the Fed is likely to wait until 2012 before it starts to raise interest rates, according to a research paper released Monday by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. The bank does not represent the official position of the central bank.
Most economists estimate that the Fed will increase the federal funds rate sooner. Mr. Semmens suggested such a move could come in the third quarter of next year or later.
With inflation apparently under control, increasing employment is another priority. Weekly jobs data released on Thursday was weaker than expected. Initial claims for unemployment insurance rose by 12,000 from the previous week, to 472,000.
Mr. Semmens said in a research note that the jobs data showed the country was "still failing to create jobs at a pace that will tackle the high level of unemployment."
Ultimately, he said, consumers will be cautious about their spending because of the weak job market.
Consumer price statistics also showed that prices for housing rose 0.1 percent, the first rise since August 2009. The food index was unchanged after increasing 0.2 percent in the last two months.
"The U.S. economy is slowing down, particularly relating to the consumer," said Allen L. Sinai, president and chief global economist for Decision Economics. "The jobs market is not improving, and we are observing a deflationary tendency in the price indices."
A report on Thursday on regional manufacturing activity showed a slowdown in activity. The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia said that regional manufacturers in a survey reported no expansion of overall employment and work hours this month, compared with May.
The survey said activity continued to expand in June, but at a slower rate than it did last month, with the index falling to 8.0 in June from 21.4 in May.
But manufacturers expected growth over the next six months.

As they had in recent months, the American indexes took their cues from European markets and started strong. The surge held throughout the day, and American indexes gained more than 2 percent, with the Standard & Poor's index breaking through a crucial technical level.
To some, it was a surprising end in a market accustomed to volatility and punctuated by sudden changes in the last hour.
"We did not see selling into strength," said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist for Prudential Financial. "The ability of the market to gain at the close is a sign that perhaps the bulls are gaining ground."
The Dow Jones industrial average was up 2.1 percent, or 213.88 points, at 10,404.77. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 2.35 percent or 25.60 points, to 1,115.23, and the Nasdaq was up 2.76 percent or 61.92 points, to 2,305.88.
Analysts said that once the S.& P. broke through its 200-day moving average and stayed there; a technical level, and perhaps a psychological one, had been breached for investors.
"It tells them that health is being restored into the market," Ms. Krosby said. "Up until today it flirted with it and then pulled back."
On Monday, for example, the market lost momentum just before the close as traders seemed to be winding down their positions, apparently not wanting to leave themselves open to developments in Europe, where sovereign debt problems have cast a pall.
"The question now becomes whether or not we see conviction buying: Do investors believe the worst is over, and we can actually work the market higher?" she said.
Art Hogan, the chief market analyst at Jefferies & Company in New York, said that crossing the moving average engendered "a self-fulfilling short cover rally."
"We usually have that 3 o'clock to 4 o'clock reversal of direction," he said.
In the absence of any single headline, investors reacted to many factors, like upbeat reports from manufacturers and new indicators on trade and home building.
Commodity prices and the euro also strengthened. Crude oil rose $1.82 to $76.94 a barrel in New York trading. The euro climbed back over $1.23.
European markets finished the day higher. The DAX in Frankfurt rose 0.82 percent while the CAC-40 in Paris settled 0.98 percent higher. The FTSE 100 in London was up 0.3 percent, held back by the BP shares, which declined another 3.8 percent.
Shares in the Boeing Company were up 4 percent at $67.48 after the company said it was starting to see increased interest in its products. Caterpillar rose 4 percent to $63.46, and Illinois Tool Works was up 2.4 percent at $46.78 after it raised its forecast.
Best Buy, a bellwether for consumer spending, fell 6 percent to $38.56 after profits edged up but fell short of analysts' expectations. "It is a good sign that we were able to take the market higher," Ms. Krosby said.
Import prices fell 0.6 percent, from a decline in petroleum prices, but the inflation numbers embedded in the trade data showed inflation was at bay, ahead of a Federal Reserve meeting next week. That was a positive sign, she said.
The S.& P. technology sector was also higher, in part because of a forecast by the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company of stronger global sales of computer chips. And a report by International Data Corporation showed year-on-year growth of 27 percent in the first quarter in the global personal computer market.
New economic figures showed a decline in home builders' sentiment. The National Association of Homebuilders' Housing Market Index fell to 17 in June from 22 in May, underscoring the importance of the government tax credit for the sector. The Empire state manufacturing index edged up to 19.57 in June from May. Though employment declined, the report indicated that the factory sector was recovering.
The Treasury's 10-year note fell 14/32, to 101 20/32 . The yield rose to 3.30 percent, from 3.25 percent late Monday.

Full text: CORRECTION APPENDED
MUMBAI, India -- S. K. Sahai's firm ships containers 2,400 nautical miles from Singapore to a port here in four or five days. But it typically takes more than two weeks to make the next leg of the journey, 870 miles by rail to New Delhi.
For most of that time the containers idle at the Jawaharlal Nehru Port near Mumbai because railway terminals, trains and tracks are severely backlogged all along the route. Counting storage and rail freight fees, Mr. Sahai estimates the cost of moving goods from Mumbai to Delhi at up to $840 per container -- or about three times as much as getting the containers to India from Singapore.
"They don't have any physical space," Mr. Sahai, who is chairman of SKS Logistics of Mumbai, said about the government-owned Indian Railways. "And all their trains are booked."
As the world looks to India to compete with China as a major source of new global economic growth, this country's weak transportation network is stalling progress.
Economists say India must invest heavily in transportation to achieve a long-term annual growth rate of 10 percent -- the goal recently set by the prime minister, Manmohan Singh. But whether measured by highways, airways or -- particularly -- far-reaching railways, India's transportation is falling short.
Critics say the growth and modernization of Indian Railways has been hampered by government leaders more interested in winning elections and appeasing select constituents, rather than investing in the country's long-term needs. It is one of the many ways that the political realities of India's clamorous democracy stand in contrast to the forced march that China's authoritarian system can dictate for economic development.
A 40,000-mile, 150-year-old network, Indian Railways is often described as the backbone of this nation's economy. And in fact it is moving more people and goods than ever: seven billion passengers and 830 million tons of cargo a year. But its expansion and modernization is not keeping pace with India's needs.
"If it has to serve as the backbone of the Indian economy, the leaders of the Indian Railways have to think big, and they need to have a larger vision," said S. Ramnarayan, a professor at the Indian School of Business and co-author of a book about the railways. "Thinking in terms of incrementalism -- a little extra here, a little extra there -- doesn't solve anybody's problem."
The crash on an eastern rail link late last month that killed 151 people and injured hundreds of others underscored the vital nature of the railroads, as well as their vulnerability. The crash, which authorities have attributed to Maoist rebels, was particularly disruptive because it disabled a busy east-west line that, along with many others, was already stretched thin.
Traffic between big cities like Mumbai and Delhi, for instance, often runs at more than 120 percent of planned capacity, which means trains travel more slowly and tracks wear out faster than intended.
And because the railways' tracks are too lightweight and the locomotives underpowered, Indian trains can haul no more than 5,000 tons of cargo, compared with 20,000-ton capacities in the United States, China and Russia.
India's fastest passenger services, the Rajdhani and Shatabdi, have top speeds of only 160 kilometers (100 miles) an hour, while even the Amtrak Acela in the United States can hit 150 miles an hour in a few stretches. China's bullet trains, meanwhile, zip along at an average speed of 215 miles an hour.
Political analysts say that the current railway minister, Mamata Banerjee, has been distracted by her party's campaign to win elections in her home state of West Bengal. Those political ambitions, they say, have inspired populist policies by Indian Railways that are at financial odds with modernization and capital investments.
Even though Indian law allows the railways to acquire land quickly through hearings before magistrates, for example, Ms. Banerjee has promised farmers and other landowners that the ministry will negotiate with each landowner whose property must be acquired for two large freight projects. While popular with landowners, the process could add years to the projects.
An assistant to Ms. Banerjee said she was not available for an interview because she was busy with recently concluded municipal elections in West Bengal.
Ms. Banerjee is hardly the first railway minister with a political agenda, though. And most of the ministers who preceded her have funneled the railways' limited resources into subsidies for passengers at the expense of freight service.
Even though passenger services lost about $4 billion last year, the government has not increased fares for seven years. And it has even lowered some prices, in the face of inflation that has ranged from 3.8 to 13 percent a year.
As a result, migrant workers, for example, can travel from Mumbai to their homes in Bihar, 1,050 miles away, for 500 rupees ($11). Last year, Ms. Banerjee introduced a new monthly ticket good for travel up to 100 kilometers (61 miles) for 25 rupees (54 cents).
"It's very difficult to run a business on that," a senior railway official said, insisting on anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.
But, he added, Ms. Banerjee is helping the "large number of poor in the country who are eking out a living."
To subsidize passenger travel, the railways levy some of the highest freight tariffs in the world. India charges four times what American companies charge for rail freight and twice as much as in China.
Business executives say their best hopes for improving the railroad's costs and capabilities may ride on solutions not wholly reliant on Indian Railways.
Four years ago, the government began allowing private companies to operate container trains. One of the new carriers is IndiaLinx, which buys rail cars and leases tracks, locomotives and workers from the Railways.
Amitabha Chaudhuri, chief executive of IndiaLinx, said his company would carry about 95,000 containers this year, up from 55,000 last year. The company, which is owned by APL Logistics of Singapore, has seen strong demand for refrigerated containers, which are in short supply in India.
Analysts and officials also hope that plans proceed for dedicated freight corridors that would greatly increase capacity along the country's most congested stretches of rail: Mumbai to Delhi in the west, and Punjab State to Calcutta on the east coast. The 1,700-mile network is expected to cost more than $9 billion.
For the western corridor, Japan has agreed to provide about $5 billion in low-interest loans to help India buy equipment and services from Japanese suppliers. And the World Bank is considering loans of up to $2.4 billion for the eastern corridor. Construction is expected to begin next year and be completed in 2017.
Analysts say India will be able to execute ambitious projects when it appoints competent managers and frees them from political interference.
A former railway bureaucrat, Elattuvalapil Sreedharan, for instance, is known for completing two major initiatives on time and on budget -- the Konkan Railways, a 472-mile line on the mountainous western coast, and the Delhi Metro, a 118-mile subway system.
And in recent years, another bureaucrat, Sudhir Kumar, helped bolster rail profits by making trains longer and heavier, and by turning them around faster.
But broadly speaking, India does not have a stellar record of executing its plans. The backlog of rail projects runs 10 pages and is short $17 billion in required financing.
The oldest incomplete project, a 46-mile line in West Bengal, began in 1974 and has been delayed because the state government has not handed over some land.
Many of the projects were added to the planning list at the behest of politicians currying favor with voters back home.
One 37-mile line in Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state, is meant to give a direct rail route between the state capital and Mainpuri, a city with a population of about 200,000. The project was added to the railway budget in 1997, but it still needs $13 million in financing -- money for which it has to compete against dozens of similar lines.
Analysts said it would be more efficient to connect such towns to main rail lines by buses. But Ms. Banerjee has said that the railways must build lines to help spur development in remote areas and smaller towns.
"We cannot and should not have a myopic view of viability," she said during her annual budget speech in February.
"What is not viable today, if connected, will become viable tomorrow."

Correction: June 18, 2010, Friday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Wednesday about India's overcrowded railways misstated the country's freight tariffs. In 2005, the most recent data available, India charged 6.446 cents to move a ton of freight one kilometer -- not $395. (The error stemmed from a misreading of a chart that indexed freight charges, benchmarking fees in the United States at 100. The chart, which used World Bank figures from 2005 adjusted for purchasing power parity, listed India's charges as 395, or, as the article correctly said, nearly four times what American companies charge.)

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Given high unemployment and low inflation, the Federal Reserve is likely to wait until 2012 before it starts to raise interest rates, a new Fed research paper states.
The paper, released Monday by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, does not represent the official position of the central bank, whose governors have declined to specify when they might begin to raise rates. The benchmark short-term interest rate, known as the federal funds rate, has been essentially zero since December 2008, and most economists estimate that the Fed will increase it earlier than 2012.
But the paper, by Glenn D. Rudebusch, a senior vice president and associate director of research at the San Francisco Fed, is notable for its plainspoken conclusion. It could carry added significance because Janet L. Yellen, the president of the San Francisco Fed, is President Obama's nominee to be vice chairwoman of the central bank.
"Fed staff economists rarely come so close to making specific forecasts of -- or recommendations for -- monetary policy, but I suspect Glenn's views are shared by many others on the staff," said Joseph E. Gagnon, a former Fed economist and now a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
Mr. Rudebusch concluded from Fed decisions over the last two decades that there was a statistical relationship between core consumer price inflation and the gap between actual unemployment and the natural, or normal, rate of unemployment.
Given that relationship, as the recession worsened and inflation slowed in 2009, the Fed in theory should have lowered the federal funds rate by another 5 percent, Mr. Rudebusch wrote. In reality, since the Fed had already hit what it calls the "zero lower bound," this was impossible; the central bank left its target range for the fed funds rate at zero to 0.25 percent.
"To deliver future monetary stimulus consistent with the past-- and ignoring the zero lower bound -- the funds rate would be negative until late 2012," Mr. Rudebusch wrote. "In practice, this suggests little need to raise the funds rate target above its zero lower bound anytime soon."
Mr. Rudebusch sought to address several objections, so far voiced by a minority of Fed policy makers, to keeping the federal funds rate near zero.
If the rate were raised too soon, it would be hard to reverse course, whereas if tightening is started too late, the Fed could catch up by raising rates at a rapid pace, he argued.
And while a few Fed officials have argued that extraordinarily low interest rates could lead to new price bubbles, or excessive leverage and speculation by banks, Mr. Rudebusch argued that the relationship between short-term interest rates and financial imbalances was "quite erratic and poorly understood," noting that Japan had very low interest rates for about 15 years without those problems.
In addition, Mr. Rudebusch said the federal funds rate was less central than in the past because the Fed has been buying mortgage bonds and Treasury securities to hold down long-term rates.
"Changes in long-term interest rates have much larger effects on the economy than equal-sized changes in short-term interest rates," he wrote.
Assuming that the Fed holds onto the roughly $2 trillion in mortgage-backed securities and Treasury debt on its books, the Fed would not need to start raising rates until the beginning of 2012, he wrote.

Abstract: Under the rules, a health insurance plan can lose its exemption if it eliminates all benefits for a particular condition or if it increases deductibles or co-payments by more than the rate of medical inflation plus 15 percentage points.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The White House on Monday will issue new rules that strongly discourage employers from cutting health insurance benefits or increasing the costs of coverage to employees, administration officials say.
The rules limit the changes that employers can make if they want to be exempt from certain provisions of the health care law passed by Congress in March. Many employers want the exemption because it allows them to keep their existing health plans intact with a minimum of changes. More than 170 million Americans have employer-sponsored insurance.
The administration said the rules would allow a smooth transition to a new, more competitive insurance market that works better for consumers. But in some respects, the rules appear to fall short of the sweeping commitments President Obama made while trying to reassure the public in the fight over health legislation.
In issuing the rules, the administration said this was just one goal of the legislation, allowing people to "keep their current coverage if they like it." It acknowledged that some people, especially those who work at smaller businesses, might face significant changes in the terms of their coverage, and it said they should be able to "reap the benefits of additional consumer protections."
The law provides a partial exemption for certain health plans in existence on March 23, when Mr. Obama signed the legislation. Under this provision, known as a grandfather clause, plans can lose the exemption if they make significant changes in deductibles, co-payments or benefits.
About half of employer-sponsored health plans will see such changes by the end of 2013, the administration says in an economic analysis of the rules.
The rules allow employers and insurers to increase benefits. But, in a summary of the rules, the administration said, "Plans will lose their grandfather status if they choose to make significant changes that reduce benefits or increase costs to consumers."
Some provisions of the new law apply to all health plans. In general, they cannot cancel coverage when a person becomes ill, and they cannot impose lifetime limits on benefits.
But "grandfathered health plans" are exempt from other requirements. In general, they do not have to provide "essential health benefits" specified by the federal government and they do not have to provide free preventive care.
Under the rules, a health insurance plan can lose its exemption if it eliminates all benefits for a particular condition or if it increases deductibles or co-payments by more than the rate of medical inflation plus 15 percentage points.
Likewise, a health plan loses its exemption if an employer reduces its contribution so that its share of the total cost of coverage declines by more than 5 percentage points. If, for example, an employer is paying 60 percent of the cost of family coverage, it would run afoul of the rules if it cut its share to 50 percent.
An employer would also lose its exempt status if it increased co-payments for doctor's visits to $45, from $30 -- a 50 percent increase -- while medical inflation was 8 percent.
Some health plans require consumers to pay a percentage of the bill, rather than a fixed dollar amount. An insurer loses its special protection if it makes any increase in this percentage -- if, for example, it requires patients to pay 25 percent of the bill for surgery, rather than the 20 percent charged in the past.
A health plan would also run afoul of the rules if it eliminated coverage for services needed to diagnose or treat a particular condition. As an example, the rules describe a health plan that covers a combination of counseling and prescription drugs for treatment of a particular mental illness. The plan would lose its exemption if it eliminated benefits for counseling.
Some insurers cap the amount they will pay for covered services each year. If they want to retain their grandfathered status, they cannot reduce any annual dollar limit that was in place on March 23.
About 133 million Americans are in group health plans from employers with 100 or more employees, the administration said, and most "will not see major changes to their coverage as a result of this regulation."

Full text: LOS ANGELES -- Save us, Buzz Lightyear.
Grumpy moviegoers have left the film business trying to dig itself out of a summer slump after a series of big-budget disappointments and the lack of a single blockbuster comedy.
Memorial Day weekend attendance was the lowest since 1993. Box office receipts for the next weekend plunged 24 percent compared with the same weekend a year earlier.
Sony's remake of "The Karate Kid" sold a surprisingly strong $56 million in North America over the last three days, landing firmly in first place, but a much more expensive adaptation of "The A-Team" from 20th Century Fox fizzled with $26 million.
It was enough to put this weekend up 11 percent over the same one last year, according to Hollywood.com, which tracks ticket data. But total domestic box office revenue since early May -- when "Iron Man 2" opened with a bang -- has fallen about 6.4 percent, to $1.02 billion, from $1.09 billion in the period a year earlier, according to Hollywood.com.
So it will take more than a robust performance from "The Karate Kid" to truly kick-start Hollywood's summer, the period between early May and Labor Day that typically accounts for 40 percent of annual ticket sales. Indeed, now comes the hard part: convincing turned-off consumers that studios have held back the good stuff.
The best chance for studios to prove that the down cycle has actually broken, box office analysts and others say, is the arrival on Friday of "Toy Story 3," starring Buzz Lightyear and pals. It is the long-anticipated third installment (this time in 3-D) in a series that helped Pixar establish computer-animated family fare as the film industry's most reliable moneymaker.
"Toy Story 2" opened with more than $75 million in 1999, when adjusted for inflation. Hollywood hopes the follow-up will handily beat that total, delivering the kind of opening weekend tally that the industry expects from its big-budget, heavily marketed releases.
Still, it may be tough to win back the favor of an audience that has been trained to expect more than Hollywood has delivered in the last few weeks. One danger is that potential filmgoers tend to overlook a next round of pictures when they did not like the last batch.
"It's all about changing their mood," Dennis Rice, a marketing consultant who previously ran Disney's publicity operation, said of the entertainment business.
Kevin Goetz, chief executive of Screen Engine, a marketing and research consulting firm that specializes in entertainment, says viewers increasingly reserve their ticket purchases for pictures that promise something truly special, whether that means amazing visual effects or extraordinary reviews.
"If you don't have a product that delivers in a unique and powerful way, then certainly the messaging has to do that," Mr. Goetz said.
A variety of other factors may be holding back the box office, including blowback from consumers over higher ticket prices. Perversely, the improving economy may have taken the edge off ticket sales that were buoyed last year, when filmgoers sought a relatively cheap diversion from financial woes.
But the primary reason is most likely ho-hum movies. In the last few weeks, Hollywood's offerings have lacked luster. "Sex and the City 2" got some of the worst reviews in memory for Warner Brothers, while "Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time" from Walt Disney was received with a collective shrug.
New comedies like "Killers" from Lionsgate and "Get Him to the Greek" from Universal Pictures registered barely a blip when compared with "The Hangover," the spring-summer comic juggernaut of 2009.
And for all the talk about a 3-D revolution, only one major 3-D film, the hit "Shrek Forever After," from DreamWorks Animation, has been released since May. At least four 3-D movies, including "The Last Airbender" from Paramount and "Despicable Me" from Universal, are still on deck for the summer.
But those will arrive without the momentum that powered last year, when eight action fantasies and animated films topped $150 million each at the spring-summer box office. They were led by four -- "Up," "Star Trek," "X-Men Origins: Wolverine" and "Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian" -- that had already been released by this point in the year.
"Yes, there seems to be a slump," acknowledged Tom Sherak, who is a consultant for Marvel Entertainment and president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences -- and is generally known as an industry cheerleader.
In some ways, the malaise mirrors what is going on at the studios. Universal is treading water, awaiting the outcome of regulatory scrutiny of Comcast's purchase of NBC Universal. Disney is trying to regain its footing after a management overhaul. Paramount has sharply reduced its release schedule. And after "Avatar," which took in nearly $750 million at the domestic box office after its release just before Christmas, everything Fox releases looks a little tepid.
If laughs are to salvage the summer, they will have to come from a somewhat bizarre face-off that on June 25 finds Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz, in the 20th Century Fox action comedy "Knight and Day," opening against Adam Sandler, Kevin James, Chris Rock, Rob Schneider and David Spade in "Grown Ups" from Sony.
Among those seven actors, none has broken the $150 million mark since 2005, though Mr. James came close last year with "Paul Blart: Mall Cop."
For Will Ferrell ("The Other Guys"), Julia Roberts ("Eat, Pray, Love"), Michael Cera ("Scott Pilgrim vs. the World") and Sylvester Stallone ("The Expendables"), the summer's challenge is not so much to be a hit as simply not to flop again.
Angelina Jolie may have a better shot with "Salt," due on July 23 from Sony. But only once, with "Mr. & Mrs. Smith," which had domestic ticket sales of $186 million for Fox in 2005, has Ms. Jolie scored a hit bigger than "The Proposal." That romantic comedy starred Sandra Bullock and took in $163 million for Disney last summer, when the film industry had more good surprises than bad.
Then, again, werewolves and vampires might save the day: "The Twilight Saga: Eclipse" is set for release by Summit Entertainment on June 30, bringing the presumed comfort that comes with a sequel built on two hits that had nearly $500 million in domestic box office sales between them.
For last weekend, "The A-Team" was a distant second behind "The Karate Kid," which starred Jackie Chan and Jaden Smith, who is Will Smith's son.
Sony executives were doing cartwheels over "The Karate Kid," which the studio said cost only about $40 million to make.
"I'm drooling into the phone right now -- just totally, totally thrilled," said Rory Bruer, Sony's president of worldwide distribution. "It's a movie that has human themes that everyone can relate to."
"Shrek Forever After" was third with $15.8 million for a new domestic total of $210 million. "Get Him to the Greek" was fourth with about $10 million ($36.5 million total), while "Killers" rounded out the top five with an estimated $8.2 million ($30.7 million total).
Looking ahead, Hollywood can at least take comfort in knowing that "Toy Story 3" is the closest thing the film industry has to an easy sell.
"All they've got to do," Mr. Rice said, "is have a big '3.' "

Abstract: The debt crisis in Europe and the ensuing drop in the value of the euro are the most recent catalysts for gold's spike last week to $1,254 an ounce, a record before adjusting for inflation, but the deeper concern is that even in the United States, government borrowing is unsustainable and the day of reckoning is at hand. Since ancient times, gold has been deemed intrinsically valuable, holding its worth even as governments fell and currencies collapsed, while seemingly casting a spell on its owners.

Full text: It is the resurgent passion of the doomsday crowd, a bet that everything will go wrong. No matter what has you worried, they say, the answer is gold.
Inflation, deflation, government borrowing or the plunging euro -- you name it -- the specter of these concerns has set off a dash to gold, driving the precious metal to new highs and illustrating how fears of economic turmoil have moved from the fringe to the mainstream.
And gold bugs, often dismissed as crackpots who hoard gold bars in the basement, are finally having their day.
"I just think you're in a world where a lot of chickens are coming home to roost," said John Hathaway, manager of the Tocqueville Gold fund. "Gold is an escape hatch."
The most visible new gold enthusiasts range from the Fox News commentator Glenn Beck on the right to the financier George Soros on the left, with even some sober-minded Wall Street types developing a case of gold fever. While their language may differ, they share a fundamental view that the age-old refuge of gold is relevant again, especially as other assets like stocks and national currencies show signs of weakness.
Now, individual investors are following their example around the world. The United States Mint is running short of gold coins, and the South African mint increased Krugerrand production by 50 percent late last month, to its highest level in 25 years, on brisk European demand.
The debt crisis in Europe and the ensuing drop in the value of the euro are the most recent catalysts for gold's spike last week to $1,254 an ounce, a record before adjusting for inflation, but the deeper concern is that even in the United States, government borrowing is unsustainable and the day of reckoning is at hand. Sales of American Eagle one-ounce gold coins tripled in May from the month before.
If governments print more money to pay off their debts, the logic goes, inflation will destroy the value of the dollar, the euro and other paper currencies -- thus enhancing the value of gold. What is more, with tax increases unlikely and with Europe on the brink, the unthinkable -- a sovereign debt default or the collapse of the credit system -- has suddenly become thinkable.
To be sure, gold buyers have always been motivated by fear. What has changed is that some of the most respected investors on Wall Street are now among the fearful.
"In recent years, we have gone from one bubble and bailout to the next," David Einhorn, a New York money manager who was among the first to foretell the failure of Lehman Brothers, said in a speech last month. "Our gold position reflects our concern that our fiscal and monetary policies are not sufficiently geared toward heading off a possible crisis."
Since ancient times, gold has been deemed intrinsically valuable, holding its worth even as governments fell and currencies collapsed, while seemingly casting a spell on its owners.
Still, gold can go down -- sometimes sharply. After peaking in 1980 at more than $800 an ounce, gold sank over the next two decades, bottoming out at just over $250 an ounce in 1999. But unlike paper assets that can become worthless, gold always retains at least some value.
These days, gold is also something of a political Rorschach test. On conservative talk radio, opposition to the Obama administration's economic policies and warnings that huge budget deficits will set off runaway inflation have made gold a hot topic of on-air discussion -- and lured gold companies as advertisers.
Tongue only half in cheek, Glenn Beck advised his audience to consider "Gold, God and Guns," while laying out three possible scenarios for the economy: recession, depression or collapse.
One major advertiser on Mr. Beck's show is Goldline, a huge California marketer of gold coins and bars that is also a sponsor of programs hosted by other prominent conservative commentators like Laura Ingraham and Mike Huckabee. Mr. Beck has said he "was a client of Goldline long before they were a client of mine," adding: "I personally don't buy gold as an investment. I buy it for protection."
Of course, the right hardly has a monopoly on gold. Mr. Soros, a prominent donor to liberal causes and candidates, holds more than $600 million in bullion and gold mining shares.
Even as worries about the global economy have intensified, gold has become easier to buy.
Although some people still regard bars of gold in a vault as the ultimate insurance policy, exchange-traded funds, or E.T.F.'s, that hold gold have exploded in popularity in recent years. Gold E.T.F.'s, which trade like stocks but track the price of physical gold, account for 1,856 tons of gold, up from less than 500 tons in 2005, according to Credit Suisse.
Besides luring individual investors, these funds have also made gold more appealing to hedge funds and other institutions, allowing them to own vast amounts of gold without the burden of having to store it.
John A. Paulson, a top New York hedge fund manager who earned billions betting against subprime mortgages, holds $3 billion worth of gold E.T.F.'s, making gold the largest single position in his $35 billion portfolio.
Daniel J. Arbess, who manages more than $2 billion in Perella Weinberg's Xerion fund, is another new gold lover. A few years ago, he said, he would not have taken a second look at gold as an investment. But now Mr. Arbess, a Harvard Law graduate and a generally conservative investor, is very serious about gold.
Spiraling deficits in the United States, Japan and Britain are unsustainable, he said, and could eventually hurt confidence in what are called "fiat currencies" -- paper money not backed by gold, including the United States dollar.
"Indebted countries may soon be forced to choose among three politically difficult alternatives: sharp cuts in expenditures, debt default or printing money to pay off debt," he said, with the last option the most likely outcome. Gold, he said, is a logical hedge against this risk, because firing up the printing presses ignites inflation.
True believers note that gold has risen in each of the last nine years, and that while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is down 13 percent since 2001, gold is now worth nearly five times what it was then.
For all its newfound respectability, gold still manages to bring out the inner survivalist in its adherents. Gold bugs like Peter Schiff of the investment firm Euro Pacific Capital in Westport, Conn., envision a black market arising in the United States, with merchants refusing paper money and insisting on gold instead, while Mr. Hathaway, the gold fund manager, says the credit system has entered "the end game."
"People probably still think I'm nuts," Mr. Hathaway said. "But I'm not talking to myself in an isolation chamber anymore. We've got company now."

Full text: Sales at retailers unexpectedly fell in May, raising some questions about how much consumers will be able to continue contributing to an economic recovery.
According to a Census Bureau report released on Friday, retail sales declined in May for the first time since last fall, mostly because of a sharp plunge in purchases of building materials.
"What's going to happen is a reassessment of the underlying momentum of the economy," said Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics. "If the monthly numbers don't improve in coming months, we can probably expect the third-quarter growth number to look very shaky."
The decline came even as a private survey showed that consumer confidence was increasing. The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary index of consumer sentiment rose to 75.5 in June, from 73.6 in May.
Retail sales fell at a seasonally adjusted rate of 1.2 percent last month after growing 0.6 percent in April. The overall number was much lower than forecasters had expected.
Not including sales at building supplies outlets, auto dealers and gasoline stations -- three of the most volatile categories -- retail sales rose 0.1 percent.
The biggest decline was in building materials, gardening equipment and supplies dealers, whose sales fell a larger-than-expected 9.3 percent over the previous month.
Economists have attributed the decline to a possible winding down of incentives like tax rebates to buy energy-efficient appliances. Sales by building material suppliers had surged more than 8 percent in each of the previous two months.
"Basically when the incentive was there, people bought," said Nigel Gault, chief United States economist at IHS Global Insight. "When the incentive dries up because funds run out, people pull back again. And frankly the correction in building materials probably has further to go."
Purchases of building materials may have also been relatively high in March and April because people were completing repairs on their houses after an unusually stormy winter, Mr. Shepherdson said.
The winding down of incentives to buy energy-efficient appliances might also partly explain the decline in sales at department stores, which sell goods like air-conditioners and kitchen appliances. Purchases at department stores fell 1.8 percent in May after declining by the same percentage in April.
Gasoline station purchases also helped drive the overall decline in spending. Gas stations' sales fell 3.3 percent in May, a decline that can be largely explained by a fall in gas prices. The Census's monthly retail sales report does not adjust for inflation.
Motor vehicle and parts dealers' sales, an especially volatile category, declined by 1.7 percent in May, and had grown by 0.6 percent the previous month. On a year-over-year basis, sales from motor vehicle and parts dealers are up 11.2 percent.
One bright spot was sales from nonstore retailers, a category that includes online purchases. These sales rose a healthy 2 percent in May, and were up 15.6 percent from the same period the previous year.
There were also modest gains in sales by furniture stores, grocery stores and health and personal care stores, among others. Sales at clothing stores, however, declined by 1.3 percent in April, after a decline of 0.7 percent in April.
Economists hope that the late Memorial Day holiday and unfavorable May weather may have pushed some holiday-related spending into June. Still, several prominent forecasters have slightly lowered their expectations for the second-quarter gross domestic product, in part because the May retail sales report and a similarly disappointing May jobs report do not bode well for strong consumer spending this quarter.
The gross domestic product grew 3 percent in the first quarter of this year, largely on the back of strong consumer spending growth. Consumer spending represents about 70 percent of the nation's final output.
In a separate report released Friday, the Census Bureau said that total business sales in April rose 0.6 percent on a seasonally-adjusted basis. Inventories rose 0.4 percent the same month.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- When it comes to the deficit, Ben S. Bernanke has a story, and he's sticking to it.
Mr. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, warned on Wednesday that "the federal budget appears to be on an unsustainable path," but also recognized that an "exceptional increase" in the deficit had been necessary to ease the pain of recession.
In nearly two hours of questioning by the House Budget Committee, however, Mr. Bernanke gave potential succor to members of both parties, while refusing to side with either of them.
To Republicans, he offered warnings about the fiscal perils of an aging population and the potential threat of soaring long-term interest rates. To Democrats, he made it clear that persistently high unemployment was a drag on growth and said that additional short-term stimulus spending might be needed.
All the while, Mr. Bernanke refused to endorse any particular spending cuts or tax increases, or even specify the balance between the two. And he was not subtle about his strategy.
"I'm trying to avoid taking sides on this because it's really up to Congress to make those decisions," he told Representative Michael K. Simpson, Republican of Idaho.
"But we need your expertise on it," Mr. Simpson pressed.
"Well, no," Mr. Bernanke replied. "Plenty of people have that kind of expertise, including the Congressional Budget Office and others."
With inflation well below the Fed's unofficial target of about 2 percent, attention has turned to the other side of the central bank's mandate: maximizing employment. At the same time, the debt crisis roiling Europe has made deficit-cutting a potent topic.
Mr. Bernanke suggested that the United States had a while longer -- but not much -- before it would have to pull in the reins.
"This very moment is not the time to radically reduce our spending or raise our taxes, because the economy is still in a recovery mode and needs that support," Mr. Bernanke told Representative Bob Etheridge, Democrat of North Carolina.
In the next breath, however, he added that continuing deficits risked a "potential loss of confidence in the markets."
Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, the top Republican on the committee, focused his opening statement on Europe. "What we are watching in real time is the rough justice of the marketplace and the severe economic turmoil that can be inflicted on profligate countries mired in debt," he said.
But if Mr. Ryan had hoped for similarly dire pronouncements from Mr. Bernanke, he was disappointed.
"If markets continue to stabilize, then the effects of the crisis on economic growth in the United States seem likely to be modest," Mr. Bernanke testified. "Although the recent fall in equity prices and weaker economic prospects in Europe will leave some imprint on the U.S. economy, offsetting factors include declines in interest rates on Treasury bonds and home mortgages, as well as lower prices for oil and some other globally traded commodities."
Representative Jeb Hensarling, Republican of Texas, cited the research of the economist Carmen M. Reinhart, who has found that growth tends to stall in countries where the national debt reaches 90 percent of gross domestic product. The United States is at just about that threshold.
"I don't think there's anything magic about 90 percent," Mr. Bernanke said, while noting that in the worst-case projections by the Congressional Budget Office, "debt and interest payments are going to get explosive in 10 or 15 years."
When Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio, asked Mr. Bernanke to "talk to me about those tax increases that we know are going to happen," Mr. Bernanke replied: "We have a recovery under way now. So in the very near term, increased taxes, cuts in spending, that are too large would be a negative, would be a drag on the recovery."
But he reiterated that "I'm not going to try to adjudicate for Congress" between tax and spending measures.
Mr. Bernanke's nimbleness in navigating deficit politics reflects his position as the most visible bridge between two administrations, having been appointed by President George W. Bush in 2006 and then reappointed by Mr. Obama to a second four-year term.
Mr. Bernanke has seemed more optimistic, or at least confident, since the crisis peaked in 2008. "As long as we have the confidence of the markets that we will be able to exit from this situation with a sustainable fiscal program, then I think we'll be O.K.," he told Mr. Simpson of Idaho.
How long that confidence will last, Mr. Bernanke did not say.
Only after several rounds of back-and-forth did he agree with Representative Chet Edwards, Democrat of Texas, that tax cuts do not entirely pay for themselves. And he danced around with Representative Gerald E. Connolly, a Virginia Democrat, on whether the Obama administration's $787 billion stimulus package last year was "necessary." Mr. Bernanke would only say it was "useful."
"It must be nice to be an economist," Mr. Connolly replied.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- At a moment when many economists warn that the American economic recovery is likely to be imperiled by prolonged high unemployment and slow growth, President Obama is discovering that the tools available to him last year -- a big economic stimulus and action by the Federal Reserve -- are both now politically untenable.
The mood in both parties of Congress has turned decidedly anti-deficit, meaning that the job-creation programs once favored by the White House and Democratic leaders in Congress have been cut back, then cut again. It is a measure of the mood that Mr. Obama on Tuesday hailed an initiative by his administration to cut the budgets of most major government agencies by 5 percent, at a time when conventional theory would call for more government spending to lift the economy.
Even the Federal Reserve is pulling in its horns. No one could expect it to cut interest rates further -- they are at rock bottom. But spurred by inflation hawks in their midst, the Fed has gotten out of the business of buying Treasury securities and mortgage bonds, one of its main strategies over the last two years for pushing down long-term interest rates.
Over the last few weeks, the cautious optimism that the economy is on the mend has given way to more caution than optimism.
"My best guess is that we'll have a continued recovery, but it won't feel terrific," Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, said at a dinner at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars on Monday night. "And the reason it won't feel terrific is that it's not going to be fast enough to put back eight million people who lost their jobs within a few years."
One could almost envision the winces in the White House as Mr. Bernanke observed that the unemployment rate "will stay high for some time." He went on to note that even if the economy grew at 3 percent, which would be considered a healthy pace, it would do little more than keep pace with the normal rate of growth of the work force.
Virtually every day of late, White House officials have struggled to explain how their strategies to provide economic stimulus to bring down the unemployment rate square with Mr. Obama's oft-expressed commitment to tackle a record budget deficit. They talk about spending this year -- in modest amounts -- while waiting for the prescriptions of the president's commission on debt reduction, which reports, conveniently, a few weeks after the midterm elections.
In the next breath, they say that the only long-term strategy that will get Americans back to work and bring the deficit under control is promoting rapid economic growth. That is the elixir that allowed the Clinton administration, where many members of Mr. Obama's team cut their teeth, to briefly wipe out budget deficits. But for now, it is unclear where that growth will come from -- and how soon.
So rather than promoting another broad stimulus package, the White House is pointing to a series of familiar-sounding, low-cost measures to create jobs: stimulating export-oriented manufacturing, subsidizing energy-efficiency improvements by homeowners, preventing layoffs of teachers and police officers and pressing for a new (and unpaid for) highway bill that could, like the Census, create a short-term burst in hiring.
Lawrence H. Summers, the director of the National Economic Council and the economic adviser at Mr. Obama's elbow, argued that the effects of last year's $787 billion spending program had not fully kicked in. "Given fiscal lag, the Recovery Act is still gaining force and having increasing impact," he said, adding that the administration's job approach "goes beyond spending programs" to include mortgage relief for homeowners and expanded lending to small businesses. "We will not let up on jobs as a priority until unemployment returns to normal levels."
Although Congress has enacted or is likely to pass an estimated $200 billion worth of additional spending since last year's stimulus package, the appetite for a big new fiscal boost has slackened.
The anti-deficit mood is not limited to Washington. Over the last two days, Britain and Germany have announced austerity plans, in contrast to what many in Europe were arguing for a year ago. Spain and France have announced similar moves. The politics of those moves vary from country to country: in Britain, it is explained by the election of a Conservative government; in Germany by the usual postwar German aversion to deficits.
But the crisis in Greece has focused minds across Europe, especially in Spain, Portugal and Ireland. So just two weeks ahead of a meeting of the Group of 20 economic powers in Toronto, there is a widespread consensus that grand stimulus programs are a thing of the past.
The box that Europe, the Obama administration and Congress find themselves in today -- desperate to stimulate the economy and fearful of the political reaction -- gives new meaning to Milton Friedman's famous line from the mid-1960s. "In one sense, we are all Keynesians now," he wrote to Time magazine, referring to the theories of John Maynard Keynes, who called for government spending to counter downward cycles in the economy. In a less-remembered continuation of that sentence, he added, "in another, nobody is any longer a Keynesian."
Today they are periodic Keynesians. The Senate has taken up a jobs bill that could cost $100 billion over the next decade, a fraction of last year's historic stimulus package, but significant by the standards of other such jobs packages over the last two decades. "Here in the Senate, jobs will remain priority No. 1," Senator Charles E. Schumer, a Democrat of New York, said Tuesday. "It'll be almost an obsession to us."
Not surprisingly, the parties cannot agree on the best path to satisfy their obsessions.
"The failure of this Congress to even produce a budget, let alone get spending under control, is doing direct harm to our economy," Representative Dave Camp of Michigan, the top Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee, said Tuesday, arguing that the $13 trillion national debt was choking off growth.
Although a growing number of economists now expect the Fed to start tightening monetary policy next year, rather than later this year, there is little sense that it will resume buying assets and printing money to do so -- a strategy called quantitative easing.
Given that inflation is well below the Fed's unofficial target of about 2 percent, Joseph E. Gagnon, a former Fed economist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, argued, "With both employment and inflation below desired levels over the foreseeable future, the case for more monetary ease is strong."
But Johan Van Overtveldt, an economist in Brussels and the author of a book on Mr. Bernanke, said he did not believe the Fed was ready to buy that argument just yet. "The Fed has already carried out monetary policies never seen before in American history," he said. "A second round of quantitative easing at the moment would substantially increase inflationary risks."

Full text: Washington
One of the political mysteries of the last year is why the White House and Congress have not been even more aggressive about trying to put people back to work.
It is true that President Obama and Democratic leaders in Congress favor more stimulus and have been stymied by Republicans and, more recently, conservative Blue Dog Democrats worried about the deficit. But it's also true that Mr. Obama, Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid have done less than they could have.
The president has not wrapped his arms around teachers, firefighters and other government workers facing layoffs and dared Republicans to oppose him, much as he did with financial reregulation. He has not pushed for a big new round of tax cuts, which could also put Republicans in a bind. And the White House has been slow to fill vacancies at the Federal Reserve that could go to officials who favor the Fed's doing more to lift economic growth.
None of these steps would have cured the job market on their own. The aftermath of the financial crisis was always going to be long and harsh. Still, the Democrats find themselves in the position of heading into a midterm election campaign with the unemployment rate near 10 percent, knowing that they have not done everything in their power to bring it down.
Publicly, Mr. Obama's advisers reject this description. "Job creation and economic recovery were and remain President Obama's top priority," Lawrence Summerssaid recently. Mr. Obama is now lobbying the Senate to pass a larger jobs bill than the House passed two weeks ago and pushing for an energy bill that could also create jobs.
But when they are not speaking for quotation, some White House and Congressional officials acknowledge that they could have done more to stimulate the economy, and sooner. In part, they have been busy with other things: legislation on health care, finance and education that could shape the economy for decades to come. The bigger reason, though, is politics.
In the face of near-united Republican opposition, top Democrats have decided that the political costs of aggressively pushing for more stimulus are too high. Any new bill will help only on the margins, and it will give Republicans another chance to blame Mr. Obama for the deficit, even though the current deficit is more of their own party's making. The Democrats may be right, too. We will never know, because we will never be able to re-run the 2010 election under a different set of circumstances.
Yet the current circumstances bring their own political risks and their own economic costs, especially for anybody who is out of work or soon may be.

If there was any doubt that the government could put people to work, at least temporarily, last year's $787 billion stimulus program should have removed it.
The bill passed in February 2009, when the economy was shedding more than 700,000 jobs a month, and it was greeted with considerable skepticism. Some economists went so far as to suggest it would hurt the economy. Michael Boskin, a Stanford professor and former aide to the first President Bush, wrote an opinion article in The Wall Street Journal on March 6, 2009, blaming Mr. Obama and his policies for the stock market's drop in previous weeks.
Soon, though, job losses began shrinking. The details -- a rebound in state spending, an increase in corporate investment and a spurt in home sales helped by tax credits -- suggested that the stimulus bill was a major cause. The Congressional Budget Office and private research firms estimate that the bill has added on the order of 2.5 million jobs. Since Mr. Boskin's op-ed article appeared, stocks are up 56 percent.
But the stimulus has been lesspopular than effective, polls show. People see that the economy remains in bad shape, and they have a hard time getting excited by the notion that it could be worse.
These lukewarm views have then been aggravated by the country's very real deficit problem. The federal government has promised to pay out vastly more in Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security over coming decades than it will collect in taxes. Any additional stimulus would only increase the deficit.
Of course, it would have a much smaller impact on the deficit than the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, the bipartisan Medicare prescription drug program or the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan did. The bond market, for its part, remains utterly calm about the near-term deficit, based on the government's extremely low borrowing costs.
But the political dynamic is set. Voters are wary of stimulus and worried about the deficit. Almost nobody in Congress is agitating for the ideal economic solution: a combination of short-term stimulus with longer-term spending cuts and tax increases. It's easier just to express somber concern about both the deficit and jobs.
Against this backdrop, Mr. Obama and his aides decided not to go all out for more stimulus.
The one part of their strategy that seems almost impossible to defend is their approach to the Fed. By law, the Fed's mission is to maintain low inflation and maximum employment. Over the last three months, inflation has been zero. Over the last two years, it has risen at the slowest pace in more than 50 years. Meanwhile, 15 million people remain unemployed.
Yet the Fed has taken no recent action to spur the economy -- like buying bonds to reduce long-term borrowing costs for households and businesses, as Joseph Gagnon, a former Fed economist, has urged. And the White House and Treasury Department have allowed two of the seven Fed governor spots to sit empty since Mr. Obama took office. He finally announced nominees on April 29, and they await Senate confirmation.
Despite all this, there is reason to think that more stimulus may finally be on the way. Last Friday's jobs report showed little private-sector job growth in May, which was a good reminder that recoveries from financial crises are usually rocky. The report has the potential to persuade Congress to expand the jobs bill passed by the House, which is now before the Senate.
As is, the House bill would cut taxes for businesses and temporarily extend jobless benefits, among other things. By the end of the year, it would add about 170,000 jobs, Moody'sEconomy.com estimates. Expanding the bill to include extra Medicaid funds for states -- which seems politically conceivable -- could add 100,000 more jobs. Expanding it to keep teachers employed -- which is unlikely -- could add 200,000 or so.
Will another half-million jobs make the economy feel strong again? No. Will the next round of stimulus be more popular than the last one? Probably not.
Is it nonetheless the right thing to do? That's another question entirely.

Abstract: There will likely be no real solution until the American health care system moves away from unfettered fee-for-service payments that encourage doctors to perform unnecessary and costly tests and procedures and pays them instead for better management of a patient's care over time.

Full text: The formula that is used to pay doctors who treat Medicare patients is producing increasingly absurd results. If it were to be followed this year, doctors would face a 21 percent cut in payments for the tests, procedures, office visits and other services they provide to elderly Americans.
That would be a disaster, driving many doctors to stop accepting Medicare patients. Luckily, nobody is seriously contemplating that. As it has done repeatedly in recent years, Congress is readying a short-term fix that would provide a modest increase in physician fees for the next 19 months.
There will likely be no real solution until the American health care system moves away from unfettered fee-for-service payments that encourage doctors to perform unnecessary and costly tests and procedures and pays them instead for better management of a patient's care over time.
The flawed reimbursement formula predates the new health care reform law by more than a decade. But its problems are a reminder that even with reform there is a lot of work ahead to rein in the cost of health care.
When first enacted in 1997, the "sustainable growth rate" formula looked liked a reasonable way to restrain Medicare spending. It set annual limits for the total amount of money to be paid to doctors in the traditional Medicare program. It also included allowances for inflation in the cost of operating a medical practice, for growth in the elderly population, and even a little extra money to pay for increases in the volume and complexity of services performed.
It worked well for the first five years. Starting in 2002 it began to hit a variety of problems. The fatal flaw in the formula was that it had no way to limit the array of services doctors provided or distinguish between valuable and needless treatments.
If doctors in the aggregate drove expenditures above the limit, the formula called for fees in the following year to grow more slowly than medical inflation or be reduced. That aggregate punishment was not enough to persuade individual doctors to change behavior.
When Medicare doctors were faced with the prospect of actual rate cuts, they screamed for help. Congress provided repeated relief. Each time it postponed a scheduled cut, the meter kept ticking and the required cuts accumulated. That is why the system was due to cut doctors' reimbursement by 21 percent on June 1.
The Obama administration is holding off, the House has approved a 19-month fix, and the Senate is expected to concur this week. The bill would raise doctors' payments, in the aggregate, by about $1 billion over current rates -- and $23 billion over what they would get if the required cuts were imposed. That is probably the best that can be done for now.
Meanwhile, the experience suggests that there could be problems with at least one key element of the new health care reform law. To hold down the cost of Medicare, it sets target levels for per capita Medicare spending beginning in 2015.
Once again the formula sets targets that may be hard to reach -- and will require Medicare to find savings in the following year if they are not. The encouraging news is that a new independent board will have the power to recommend a much broader range of potential savings, not just cuts in doctor payments, to make up the difference. Congress will have the final say.
The reform law also tries to cut costs by emphasizing primary care and setting up pilot programs to find better ways to organize and deliver high-quality care at lower cost and move the system away from fee-for-service payments. If these work well, they could finally put a real brake on Medicare spending.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- President Obama is that rare politician who is also a gifted writer, and he understands the power of a good metaphor. So you had to believe, on some level at least, that the president could appreciate the poetic significance of that cloud of oil, ubiquitous on cable television all last week, spewing endlessly from a 5,000-foot-deep puncture in the Gulf of Mexico. Mr. Obama's administration, too, had been breached, and the accumulating cloud threatened to obscure its considerable achievements -- particularly the comprehensive reforms of health care and federal education spending -- as the president heads toward the halfway point in his term.
The man-made catastrophe in the gulf does not yet constitute an existential threat to Mr. Obama's presidency. (There's not much Mr. Obama can do about it at this point, anyway, short of slapping on a scuba suit and sticking his hand in the pipe until the relief well is completed.) But then, it is never really one crisis that diminishes a president as much as a succession of crises, avoidable or not. And this might be the real danger for Mr. Obama's administration -- not that the spill itself remains unmanageable, but that it comes to represent a pattern in the public mind, a sense that too many dangers at once (mines and foreign economies collapsing, possible war on the Korean peninsula) seem to be gushing beyond his reach.
As much as we talk about ideology and competence, our judgment of presidents doesn't hinge on either of these things in isolation. What matters is the perception -- or perhaps the illusion -- that one is shaping events, rather than being shaped by them. The modern presidency, like the old "Get Smart" series, is about chaos versus control.
Take, for instance, the cautionary tale of Jimmy Carter, whose presidency, it is often said, was felled by inflation, or maybe Iranian hostage-takers or gas shortages, depending on who is doing the eulogizing. In fact, inflation was probably at the core of Carter's troubles. Those other misfortunes contributed, too.
But as the historian Kevin Mattson made clear in his recent book about the Carter presidency, "What the Heck Are You Up To, Mr. President?" you also have to factor in the meltdown at Three Mile Island, Soviet tanks in Afghanistan and the vivid specter of Skylab hurtling day after day toward a stationary and helpless Earth -- in other words, an air of general chaos and a belief that a president lauded for his humility had too little control over larger forces in the universe. This explains, too, the appeal of Ronald Reagan, whose cinematic persona suggested that he would have lassoed the Skylab satellite and hurled it back into space.
Similarly, George W. Bush was undone, during his second term, not only by a sluggish economy or the failure to find biological weapons in Iraq, but also by the devastation of Hurricane Katrina and the cascade of unsettling headlines about bird flu and failing banks, suicide bombers and Korean missiles. This stood in contrast to his predecessor, Bill Clinton, who could not have done more to sink his own presidency had he tried, but who left office with strong approval ratings nonetheless -- in part because of a surging economy, but also because he seemed at his most commanding when unpredictable crises (the Columbine High School shooting and the Oklahoma City bombing come to mind) threatened to undermine our collective sense of order.
Political chaos theory, if you want to call it that, has always been integral to the American presidency. It's what Abraham Lincoln understood when, days after taking office, he sought to take charge of events at Fort Sumter, rather than heed the advice of those who thought he should simply let them play out. Franklin Roosevelt demonstrated the same essential insight in confronting the Great Depression -- that people needed to know you would impose order, even if not every attempt at doing so worked. (Roosevelt and his intrepid New Dealers would probably be thinking about ways to drain the Gulf of Mexico right about now.)
And yet a president's ability to confront chaos seems more central to the office now than it was, say, a half-century ago, when almost no one blamed Dwight Eisenhower for allowing quiz show scandals or Mississippi tornadoes to go unchecked. In part, this is probably a function of our having lost so much faith in the ability of government generally. There is, after all, a short distance between believing that government doesn't solve our problems to believing that government actually causes them, and a lot of Americans in the last few decades have made the leap. If tar balls are turning up along the Gulf Coast, then some bureaucrat somewhere must be to blame -- and why not the bureaucrat-in-chief?
On a deeper level, though, we may be reacting to our own lack of control as workers, providers and parents. For about 40 years, since the onset of industrial decline, Americans have been trying to negotiate an increasingly unstable economic and cultural landscape, the effects of which are clear in any community where factories or farms (or often both) have withered away -- substance abuse, failing schools, higher rates of crime and divorce. The chaos is all around us, and what we ask of a president, increasingly, is to somehow use the instruments of government to rein it in.
Mr. Obama seems to find it particularly hard to adjust to this role, perhaps because he has always defined himself as an outsider to Washington and its governing apparatus -- someone who would reform government, but not necessarily master its inner workings. This, after all, was the subtext of his entire debate with Hillary Rodham Clinton during the Democratic primaries in 2008; she was the insider who could competently work all the pulleys and levers of government, and he was the outsider looking to cast aside what he later called the "childish things" that dominated debate in Washington.
The problem here for Mr. Obama is that, almost 18 months after assuming office, he still seems to regard himself as something of an intellectual critic of government, when, in fact, what Americans expect from him now is markedly different. The transition is long behind us, which means the president embodies the government he once assailed and is held accountable, fairly or not, for its failures.
The disconnect was on vivid display during Mr. Obama's news conference late last month, when, despite professing full responsibility for his administration's response to the leak, he referred several times to what the "federal government" was doing, as if he himself were merely a disappointed spectator like the rest of us. He railed coolly against the "cozy and sometimes corrupt relationship" between oil companies and the government, despite the fact that his administration had been governing for more than a year. And he seemed unbothered admitting to reporters that he didn't know whether his own director of the Minerals Management Service had been fired or resigned.
By the time the president spoke again at the White House and then revisited the gulf on Friday, he seemed genuinely enraged at BP. The writer in him, perhaps, sensed that the oil from a snapped-off pipe on the ocean floor might yet come to signify something deeper about his administration. But chaos-weary Americans no longer needed him to share their outrage at the leak. They needed him to finally shut it off.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates has ordered the military and the Pentagon's civilian bureaucracy to find tens of billions of dollars in annual savings to pay for war-fighting operations, senior officials said Thursday.
His goal is $7 billion in spending cuts and efficiencies for 2012, growing to $37 billion annually by 2016.
Every modern defense secretary has declared war on Pentagon waste and redundancy. And there have been notable, but relatively narrow successes, in closing and consolidating military bases or in canceling a handful of weapons systems.
But if Mr. Gates's sweeping plan is fully enacted, none of the armed services or Pentagon civilian agencies and directorates would be immune from the pain of annual cost-cutting, which would become institutionalized across the Defense Department.
The spending guidelines were delivered orally to senior military officers and civilian officials before Mr. Gates's departure this week for an Asian security conference in Singapore, and the official signed guidance will be issued over coming days.
The goal is to force all of the Defense Department agencies and organizations, and all of the armed services, to save enough money in their management, personnel policies and logistics to guarantee 3 percent real growth each year, beyond inflation, in the accounts that pay for combat operations.
Current budget plans project growth of only 1 percent in the Pentagon budget, after inflation, over the next five years.
"Given the nation's fiscal situation, there is an urgency to doing this, rather than shifting more of the nation's resources toward national defense," William J. Lynn III, the deputy defense secretary, said in an interview.
Mr. Gates's spending orders offer a considerable incentive to the armed services. Each dollar in spending cuts found by a military department would be reinvested in the combat force of that branch, and not siphoned away for other purposes.
Senior officials acknowledge that powerful constituencies are expected to line up in opposition to cuts of favorite programs -- with criticism anticipated from the defense industry, Congress, military headquarters, Pentagon personnel and retirees.
"We will need to address the reasons things are in the budget in order to be able to reduce overhead," Mr. Lynn said. "We are going to have to be engaged in dialogue with industry, with Congress, with other agencies, with the White House and inside the Pentagon -- all the stakeholders."
The new directives are aimed at three distinct areas of spending.
The first is management and personnel, overhead, logistics and base operations, and support missions.
The second is the war-fighting accounts themselves. Major targets for the next fiscal year already identified by the Pentagon leadership, and supported by the White House, include canceling a program to buy an alternative engine for the F-35 warplane and ending production of the C-17 cargo aircraft. Officials said a range of lower-priority programs would also be under review.
The third area is Mr. Gates's own Defense Department staff and agencies.
Pentagon agencies that handle specialized tasks like missile defense and commissaries, as well as Mr. Gates's directorates for such matters as personnel and readiness, policy, intelligence and public affairs, will be ordered to reduce costs by trimming personnel and streamlining business practices.
Mr. Gates set a deadline of July 31 for receiving details on programs and personnel to be cut and a description of savings in management practices to be included in the budget proposal for the next fiscal year, 2012. Two-thirds of the ordered savings must be an actual money transfer from noncombat accounts to the war-fighting budget, while one-third can be found in efficiencies and eliminating redundancies and overhead.
The specific instructions are included in three unclassified guidance documents signed by Mr. Gates -- one to the armed services, one to the Pentagon's primary agencies and directorates, and one to the global combatant commands.
For fiscal year 2012, the departments of the Army, Air Force and Navy -- which includes the Marine Corps -- must each find $2 billion in savings, while the rest of the Defense Department must find $1 billion in savings. By 2016, each military department must have $10 billion in savings, with $7 billion across the rest of the Pentagon.
"You are not going to be able to do it just on pure efficiencies," Mr. Lynn said. "You are going to have to eliminate lower-priority programs. You are going to have to find headquarters that you don't think you need. You are going to have to find staffs that you think you can cut."
The drive for finding savings to guarantee real growth in spending on combat missions was first laid out by Mr. Gates in a speech in early May at the Eisenhower Presidential Library and Museum in Kansas.
Among the vexing spending problems identified by Mr. Gates was the continuously rising cost of health care. Mr. Gates said the nation owed quality health care to those in uniform, their families and veterans, but pointed out that members of the military health care system had not been charged increases in premiums for 15 years -- even though the program's annual cost had risen to $50 billion from $19 billion a decade ago.
"Health care costs are eating the Defense Department alive," Mr. Gates said. Officials said that changes to the military health care program would be considered, but that no decisions had been made.

Full text: PHILADELPHIA -- It may be best to dispel any illusions immediately. The only certain images we seem to have of the last queen of Egypt, Cleopatra VII, have no discernible resemblance to the painted faces of Elizabeth Taylor or Claudette Colbert or Sarah Bernhardt. Those visages can be contemplated with far more sensuous contentment than the Egyptian queen's bulbous, knotty and eroded features stamped on gold coins from the first century B.C.
But by the time we see the cinematic, romanticized faces of Cleopatra from films and paintings in the final gallery of the new exhibition "Cleopatra: The Search for the Last Queen of Egypt," opening Saturday at the Franklin Institute here, we are prepared to acknowledge the virtue of at least some idealization. The wonder we feel is not at Cleopatra's beauty (which Plutarch reports was "in itself not altogether incomparable") but at the extraordinary cultural universe that preceded her and surrounded her before Egypt submitted to the Romans in 30 B.C. and Cleopatra -- Egypt's last pharaoh and the end of the Ptolemaic dynasty -- committed suicide.
The exhibition is powerful. But that is not really because of Cleopatra; it is because a lost world is resurrected here. There are some 150 artifacts on display, and the vast majority were found buried in the silt and clay of the Bay of Aboukir, off the coast of Alexandria, Egypt. Since 1992 those waters have been explored by Franck Goddio and his European Institute of Underwater Archaeology. Using a nuclear magnetic resonance magnetometer, Mr. Goddio mapped the geographic fault lines beneath the clouded waters and has brought to the surface a small fraction of what lies below.
He has identified the relics and ruins as remnants of the ancient cities of Canopus and Heracleion, submerged by tidal waves, earthquakes and wars; he has also discovered palaces and temples of the nearby eastern port of Alexandria, the city that the Macedonian conqueror Alexander the Great made his capital, and that Cleopatra imagined could rival Rome. The first half of the exhibition shimmers in atmospheric blue light, the artifacts accompanied by videos of their excavation by red-suited divers maneuvering through opaque waters.
The sense of a lost and mythical world brought into the half-light would be irrelevant, though, if the resurrected objects didn't live up to the promise -- and they do. We are led through a sequence of discoveries, coming to learn along the way how the Ptolemaic heirs to Alexander's conquest created a hybrid religion and culture, Greek styles overlaying Egyptian allusions, transformed gods worshiped in new temples, ancient ideas given fresh, sensuous form.
Here, for example, from Canopus, is a great life-size head of the god Serapis that was mounted in his most famous temple; the Egyptian god Osiris with his healing powers is transmuted into a Grecian deity, his eroded face framed by flowing locks. The glories of Heracleion can be glimpsed in two towering 16-foot figures of pink granite: images of Ptolemaic royalty. And, even if we are not prepared to testify to Cleopatra's beauty, here is a third century B.C. statue of a queen, whose draped garment is sculptured to seem translucent, clinging to the textured stone flesh, posing an unmatchable challenge to even the most idealized image of Cleopatra.
Mr. Goddio has also put these objects into a geographic and cultural context, assisted by the University of Pennsylvania Egyptologist and guest curator David Silverman (who is also curator of the Egyptology section of the Penn Museum, which is offering a ticket tie-in with the Franklin show). Mr. Goddio has found stone pieces that nearly complete earlier finds (one of which was acquired by the Louvre in 1817). When fit together, as is shown here, they form a naos -- a stone shrine or ark that once held the temple god. Their carvings contain what may also be the world's first astrological chart, along with a creation myth not found elsewhere.
Mr. Goddio has also mapped the submerged harbors of these once thriving cities and found that a canal linking Canopus and Heracleion that, he suggests, would have been used in a ritual watery journey paying homage to Osiris's powers, connecting the newer religious celebrations with older beliefs in the centrality of the Nile. This was the realm within which Cleopatra (along with Julius Caesar and then Mark Antony) moved.
But because this exhibition, like the King Tut show now in New York, is a production of Arts and Exhibitions International, which has specialized in large-scale cultural attractions, it is meant to attract big audiences both here and in other cities in the United States it is expected to visit after it leaves the Franklin Institute on Jan. 2; the National Geographic Society is also involved. So there is a certain amount of slick packaging that comes along with the substance. My biggest misgiving is a sense that Cleopatra herself is a lot less important to these discoveries than it seems here.
There are some traces attributed to her, of course, aside from gold coins with her less-than-sensuous profile. We see fragments of a papyrus, on loan from the Neues Museum in Berlin, that we are told shows Cleopatra's own signature to a royal decree; she has written the Greek word "ginesthoi": "make it happen."
Every visitor also gets an audio tour in which an actress speaking as Cleopatra recounts the oft-retold tale of her life and death while trying to explain the artifacts before us. Here too the temptation is to silence the story, which can end up distracting from the sights. It seems imposed on the actual objects rather than growing directly from their importance.
Cleopatra's role also seems to be a bit overbearingly insisted upon in the last part of the exhibition, which is devoted to the excavations overseen by Zahi Hawass, the secretary general of Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities, whose patronage is required for any exploration of Egyptian antiquities.
Convinced by the arguments of the archaeologist Kathleen Martinez, Mr. Hawass says he believes that the tomb holding the remains of both Mark Antony and Cleopatra may lie not in Alexandria but in a temple near the city at Taposiris Magna. In a video he is far more definitive about the excavations there than the evidence we are shown fully justifies; more explanation is needed. But by that time there has already been enough justifiable excitement in the show, so suspicions of its inflation here do not really interfere. (Mr. Hawass may also be proven correct.)
Besides, though Cleopatra is the selling point, the catalog for the exhibition, along with Mr. Goddio's discoveries, make it clear that notions of her beauty and power, and even Shakespeare's imagining of her clasping the slithering poisonous adder to her breast, lulling her to sleep like a nurse sucking an infant, are representations not just of an individual but of something larger.
Cleopatra saw herself as the incarnation of a god, in this case of Isis, the sister of the murdered Osiris. She finds his body parts, which have been dispersed through Egypt's waterways, pieces them together, brings him back to life, and ultimately gives birth to his child. It is an act combining creation, resurrection and procreation, and something of that creative spirit seems evident throughout the artifacts here. They are relics of an energetic hybrid culture that still inspires idealization.
In this show Mr. Goddio and his team have done something similar. Like Isis they have pieced together the scattered remnants of a long-lost world, resurrecting them from watery depths. In the process they have very nearly brought them back to life.

U.S. Presses The Airlines To Do More For the Flier

Abstract: In response to the proposed rules, the Air Transport Association of America, an airline trade group, issued a statement that said: The A.T.A. member airlines' shared goal is to provide a safe, efficient, reliable and economically viable air transportation system consistent with the expectations of their customers, employees and shareholders.

Full text: The Transportation Department signaled on Wednesday that it planned to be more aggressive in forcing airlines to address common traveler frustrations, proposing a wide range of consumer protections. They come on top of earlier rules limiting how much time passengers can sit on planes on the tarmac.
The proposed rules would, among other things, raise compensation for passengers denied boarding on oversold flights, allow customers to get a full refund within 24 hours of buying an airline ticket and require reimbursement of baggage fees and expenses when luggage is not delivered on time.
They would also require the airlines to more speedily notify travelers about flight delays and cancellations and ban airlines and ticket agents from advertising prices that are not the full fare -- specifically mandating clearer disclosure in advertisements for "one-way" fares that can only be acquired as part of a round-trip ticket.
Taken together, the proposals, which are expected to take effect in the fall, are the Obama administration's answer to rising frustrations about airline delays, proliferating fees, shady advertising practices and the general lack of responsiveness by carriers to customer complaints. Legislation to deal with some of these issues remains stalled in Congress, and previous administrations generally relied on the airlines to address these problems themselves.
"All of these rules come about as a result of complaints that we've heard from the flying public," Ray LaHood, the transportation secretary, said at a news briefing. "These are the things that people get irritated about."
The tarmac rules, which took effect in late April, require airlines to give passengers stuck on the tarmac the option to get off the plane after three hours, with exceptions for safety and security reasons. Carriers were also required to develop plans to deal with lengthy tarmac delays and provide passengers with snacks, water and working bathrooms.
The new proposals expand the number of airlines required to adopt tarmac delay contingency plans to include foreign carriers, which would also have to begin filing data with the Transportation Department about tarmac delays.
The reporting provision would be extended to any carrier operating any aircraft with 30 or more seats, including regional airlines. Currently the rule applies only to the largest airlines in the United States.
Both American and foreign airlines would be required to include these contingency plans in their contracts of carriage -- the lengthy legal document governing any ticket purchase -- a provision the passenger advocacy group FlyersRights.org asked the department to adopt.
"That gives more notification to the passenger," said Kate Hanni, founder of FlyersRights. "It also adds a layer of enforceability."
Ms. Hanni said raising the compensation for passengers denied boarding was another provision she had requested. In her view, it is the most important provision in the proposed new rules, based on the number of complaints her organization has received about this issue.
The minimum compensation would be increased more than 50 percent, to $650 to $1,300, depending on the destination and the length of the delay. The new amounts would be automatically adjusted to account for inflation every two years.
The compensation for bumped passengers was raised two years ago for the first time in two decades, but by an amount that fell short of the cost of the inconvenience many experienced.
The rules would require airlines to offer compensation to passengers who were bumped from their scheduled flights and were traveling on frequent-flier awards (not just those who paid for their tickets). The airlines would also have to inform bumped passengers that they can choose monetary compensation in lieu of the travel vouchers that airlines often offer as an alternative to cash.
These vouchers typically have restrictions on how and when they can be used, potentially making them as difficult to redeem as frequent-flier awards. The new rule would require carriers to clearly outline any such limitations when they offer vouchers.
In response to the proposed rules, the Air Transport Association of America, an airline trade group, issued a statement that said: "The A.T.A. member airlines' shared goal is to provide a safe, efficient, reliable and economically viable air transportation system consistent with the expectations of their customers, employees and shareholders. Today's D.O.T. notice of proposed rule-making will be evaluated against that standard, with a focus on minimizing potential passenger inconvenience."
Representatives from individual airlines declined to comment, saying they needed time to digest the 84-page document, but would be participating in the comment process. The government estimates the new rules would cost the airlines $26 million over 10 years, though these figures are difficult to quantify.
All the proposals announced Wednesday are subject to a 60-day public comment period, and Mr. LaHood encouraged "common, ordinary citizens" to submit feedback online at Regulations.gov. The department is also working with Cornell to make it easier for travelers to comment.
As part of an effort to increase participation in agency rule-making, Cornell's RegulationRoom.org Web site lets travelers choose an issue and post their opinions.
One topic the department is soliciting feedback on is dealing with passengers who have severe peanut allergies. It offered several options, including prohibiting airlines from serving peanuts or requiring carriers to create a peanut-free zone.
"What we're really trying to do is lower the barriers to participation," said Cynthia Farina, a professor at Cornell Law School who is working on the university's rule-making initiative for the Web.
Speaking last month at the first meeting of the Future of Aviation Advisory Committee at the Transportation Department's headquarters in Washington, Mr. LaHood acknowledged his own frustration with the government's rule-making procedures.
"We're as frustrated as you all are about rule-making," he said. "It's a torturous process."

Full text: HONG KONG -- The booming pace of China's manufacturing growth slowed somewhat in May, as an array of government steps to forestall overheating in the giant economy began to take effect, data showed Tuesday.
Two surveys of purchasing managers in China, one by the government's Federation of Logistics and Purchasing and another by HSBC, eased in May. Both readings remained strong and showed that the manufacturing sector was continuing to expand -- but also indicated that the government's attempts over the past months to slow the pace of economic growth were bearing fruit.
Buoyed by government spending programs and a flood of easy credit from state-controlled banks, China's economy recovered rapidly from the global financial crisis last year. With an expected growth rate of about 10 percent in 2010, China is poised to overtake Japan as having the world's second-largest economy, after the United States, sometime this year.
Much of the rest of Asia also has resumed solid growth, and though purchasing managers' indexes in South Korea, Taiwan and Australia also dipped in May, the region at this stage remains largely unaffected by the European debt worries and the probable slowdown in Europe's already feeble recovery.
"I remain cautiously optimistic about the outlook for Asia," said Stephen Schwartz, Asia economist for BBVA in Hong Kong, adding that he did not think a slowdown in Europe would be enough to derail the growth momentum across Asia.
"Asia is taking a breather, and the trade cycle is slowing," echoed Frederic Neumann, regional economist at HSBC in Hong Kong. "But it's far too early to talk about a hard landing in China."
The purchasing managers' index published by China's logistics federation slipped to 53.9 in May from 55.7 in April, close to what analysts had expected. And the index compiled by HSBC fell from a revised 55.2 in April to 52.7 in May, the lowest reading in 11 months. A reading higher than 50 indicates expansion.
Many analysts welcomed the slight decline as a positive development and said it should ease market concerns about more aggressive growth-tamping steps.
The Shanghai composite index, the main stock market gauge for mainland China, has been one of the world's worst performers this year as investors have fretted about China's policy measures. The index fell an additional 0.9 percent Tuesday, taking its total decline since Jan. 1 to about 22 percent.
"We believe the moderation in P.M.I. in May should provide some comfort to the market, reducing concerns about economic overheating," Qing Wang, China economist at Morgan Stanley in Hong Kong, said in a note.
Soaring property prices, which have been among the side effects of the government stimulus measures, remain a major thorn in the government's side.
Beijing has introduced a string of measures in recent months to deflate what many analysts describe as a building bubble.
On Tuesday the state-controlled China Daily reported that the government had signaled that it would gradually introduce taxes on property holdings. It also cited an unidentified government source who said a tax would be levied on state-owned properties, starting with Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province, on a trial basis. Other details, including on timing, remained sketchy, but the news was fresh evidence of Beijing's determination to rein in property prices.
The government has also instructed state-owned banks to cut back on the amount of loans they are making, and to set aside a larger portion of their reserves, a measure that restricts the amount of money the banks can lend.
Both measures are part of a precarious balancing act that policy makers in Beijing -- and in other countries across the region -- are now engaged in: The authorities are seeking to slow down the breakneck speed of growth without choking it off entirely.
But the uncertainties about Europe, combined with signs that China's measures to rein in the booming property market are taking effect, have reduced that chance that the government will intensify its tightening measures, Mr. Wang and other economists say.
Elsewhere in Asia, too, policy makers are expected to put on hold plans to scale back the stimulus measures they introduced after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008.
The Australian central bank Tuesday kept its key interest rate unchanged at 4.5 percent, interrupting the series of increases it started in October.
Rising inflation pressures in India mean there is an "urgent" need for a rate rise there, said Mr. Neumann of HSBC.
But elsewhere, inflation pressures have eased, helped by lower commodity prices, meaning the need for rate increases has declined.
"It's very much a fine-tuning exercise now," said Mr. Schwartz of BBVA. "It's become even more challenging for policy makers in Asia to get the balance right."

Full text: OTTAWA -- In a tentative and qualified move, the Bank of Canada increased its benchmark lending rate on Tuesday for the first time since July 2007.
The increase reflected growing concerns about inflation related to Canada's booming real estate market and strong economic growth. But the relatively small size of the rate increase, one quarter of a percentage point, also demonstrated the bank's concern about global financial stability.
The increase, which brought the central bank's overnight rate to 0.5 percent, is the first by a Group of 7 industrialized country since the market downturn of 2008. Australia, which also has an economy based on commodity exports, has posted a series of rate increases in the last several months but its central bank decided on Tuesday to leave its cash rate steady at 4.5 percent.
In a statement, the Bank of Canada cited the "robust 6.1 percent" growth of Canada's economy in the first quarter, which was driven mostly by residential real estate and consumer spending.
But the bank suggested that the economic turmoil in Europe would make further increases unlikely soon.
"Given the considerable uncertainty surrounding the outlook, any further reduction of monetary stimulus would have to be weighed carefully against domestic and global economic developments," the bank said.
Sal Guatieri, senior economist with BMO Capital Markets, a unit of the Bank of Montreal, said that the modest increase would most likely have very little effect.
"This is a baby step," he said. "Interest rates are still exceptionally low. It really does nothing to slow the economy down."
The evolution of Europe's economy will determine whether the Bank of Canada follows up with further rate increases, Mr. Guatieri added.
"Monetary policy will not be on autopilot," he said.
Canada's recent economic growth has bypassed many manufacturers in Ontario and Quebec.
"Making it more expensive for manufacturers to borrow to create jobs in Canada is not going to help," said Sylvain Schetagne, the senior economist at the Canadian Labour Congress.
Mark J. Carney, the governor of the Bank of Canada, has hinted broadly for months that rate increases were likely this year.
"It was widely expected not only in banks and boardrooms but households and kitchens," said Phil Soper, the president and chief executive of Brookfield Real Estate Services of Toronto.
That caused an unusually large number of Canadians to enter the real estate market before mortgage rates rose. Unlike banks in the United States, Canada's banking system emerged largely unscathed from the credit crisis of 2008, so mortgages were easily available in Canada.
But the run on the real estate market has led to concerns that prices were reaching unsustainable, and unaffordable, levels in some cities, particularly Vancouver and Toronto.
In response, the federal government tightened some lending rules, but that had little apparent impact. The modest size of Tuesday's increase means it is unlikely to significantly slow the demand for housing, said Gregory Klump, the chief economist of the Canadian Real Estate Association. It is unlikely to affect charges for the five-year, fixed-rate mortgages that are the most common form of real estate lending in Canada, he said.
"It's not a big deal," he said, adding that unaffordable prices are more likely to slow demand for real estate and stabilize prices over the coming months.
Last week, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development urged the Bank of Canada to raise interest rates "without delay" and suggested that the Canadian government wind down stimulus spending. Like some Canadian economists, it also raised concerns about personal debt levels in Canada.

Full text: FRANKFURT -- If the European Central Bank has one monetary dragon it considers essential to slay, it is inflation.
Keeping inflation under control is the central bank's primary legal responsibility, and as Europe struggles to overcome economic problems caused by the sovereign debt crisis, inflation has remained the bank's primary focus.
But some economists say it has become a driving obsession that has blinded the bank to a potentially bigger threat to Europe: deflation.
The central bank's doubters grew louder after it made a big show of taking measures to cancel out the supposed inflationary impact of the government bond purchases it began on May 10 to help keep Greece and several other euro zone countries from defaulting on their debts.
"It's nuts: how can they be concerned about the inflationary impact of this?" said Carl B. Weinberg, chief economist of High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y. "If I were the head of the E.C.B., I would be printing money to avert the decline in the money supply."
Many economists regard deflation as more dangerous than inflation, because it prompts consumers to delay purchases as they wait for lower prices, creating a downward spiral of lower demand and production. Deflation is also bad for debtors like Greece, because they may have to pay back money that would be worth more than it was when they borrowed it.
Economists like Mr. Weinberg -- and a few policy makers as well -- are beginning to worry that a danger of deflation in Europe, similar to the one that strangled Japanese growth for most of the 1990s, is a bigger threat than inflation.
Prices fell in Ireland in April, while inflation was below 1 percent in five other euro zone countries. The problem also extends outside the euro zone.
"We all share some risks and problems in common with Japan circa 1995," Adam S. Posen, a member of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee, told an audience at the London School of Economics on May 2.
The United States is also at risk, Mr. Posen said, though he rated the chances of deflation there as low. But just as Japan did in the 1990s, the European Central Bank and the United States Federal Reserve have cut interest rates close to zero while pumping huge amounts of credit into their economies. That means the two central banks would have limited policy tools left with which to combat a collapse in prices and demand.
The downward pressure on prices has its roots in the economic decline that followed the 2008 financial crisis, but Europe's sovereign debt problems are likely to add extra impetus. Governments, including those of Spain and Germany, are sharply reducing spending to lower their deficits, which will inevitably curb consumer demand and employment, hindering growth.
Inflation in the euro zone -- the 16 countries that use the euro -- rose slightly in April, to an annual rate of 1.5 percent, from 1.4 percent in March. Declines in categories like recreation and culture, communications and vacation tour packages blunted the impact of higher transportation costs. And so-called core inflation -- which excludes energy prices and which most economists consider a better measure for policy-making purposes -- declined to 0.7 percent in April from 0.8 percent in March. By either measure, the overall rate was still well below the central bank's target of about 2 percent.
The real challenge for policy makers will occur in the coming months and years as Spain, Greece and Portugal struggle to regain their competitiveness on international markets. Without their own currencies to devalue, they have little choice but to cut wages and keep them well below those in countries like Germany and France. Pay cuts and lower government spending will put downward pressure on prices.
Spanish core inflation already turned negative in April.
A mild decline in prices in a few euro zone countries can be managed, economists say, but it will add to the risks of deflation. And the central bank will face more difficulty than usual in devising a monetary policy that fits both the ailing countries and the faster-growing economies like Germany and France.
"The E.C.B. has a careful balancing act to do," said Dennis Snower, president of the Kiel Institute for the World Economy in Germany.
The central bank has remained firm in its focus on containing inflation. Jean-Claude Trichet, the bank's president, has said he considers inflation a tax on the poor. And the bank's charter obliges it to serve foremost as guardian of price stability.
As recently as Friday, Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, a member of the bank's executive board, defended the wisdom of the mandate. In a speech in Rabat, Morocco, he said permitting inflation to rise to make it easier for European nations to repay their debts, as some have urged, would backfire.
The resulting decline in the value of government bonds would inflict "major losses on the banks and financial institutions which have been heavily investing in these markets, potentially undermining the recovery," he said.
Nevertheless, Mr. Trichet has been under fire, especially from critics in Germany, ever since the central bank began the unprecedented bond purchases to halt a sell-off of Greek, Portuguese and Spanish government debt.
By buying government bonds on the open market, and being coy about how much it was spending, the bank was able to reduce the high premiums investors were demanding for debt from the weakest countries. A continuation of the market rout would have raised the interest rates that Spain and other countries had to pay to sell new bonds, aggravating their already grave fiscal problems.
The problem was that, to buy the bonds, the bank had to expand the assets it held on its books. So to prove that it had not stooped to printing money, the bank promised to offset the bond purchases, which totaled 26.5 billion euros ($32.6 billion as of May 24, the most recent data available), by taking in a like amount in short-term deposits from banks. In effect, it siphoned off as much liquidity as it had added.
The bond purchases were only the latest of a series of extraordinary moves that Mr. Trichet has pursued to stabilize the European banking system. Since the beginning of the financial crisis, the central bank has been essentially keeping banks afloat by providing almost unlimited loans at 1 percent interest.
Mr. Trichet is eager to squash any doubts that such moves represent a shift in the bank's focus on inflation, said Mr. Snower of the Kiel Institute. "The E.C.B. is showing very clearly that its objectives have not changed."
Other economists say that scale of the bond purchases would not increase the money supply enough to pose an inflation risk. And the money supply is falling because of a decline in bank lending.
In addition, factories are operating below capacity and euro zone unemployment is at 10 percent. Extra money in the system would not create scarcities of goods or labor that could drive up prices, Mr. Weinberg of High Frequency Economics said.
"You don't have to pay any more to get those workers to come out of unemployment," Mr. Weinberg said.
The recent decline of the euro against the dollar could create some inflation. Oil and other commodities are priced in dollars and could become more expensive in euros.
Still, few economists see prices rising. "There is no reason to fear high inflation for the time being," Simon Junker, a Commerzbank analyst, said in a note.
Much of Mr. Trichet's anti-inflation stance seems aimed at mollifying Germany's anxiety over the bank's bond purchases.
After the purchases, Mr. Trichet gave interviews to three leading German publications, an unusually high number in such a short period. In each case, he tried to reassure Germans on inflation and convince them that the euro is as solid as the German mark that they reluctantly gave up 11 years ago.

Full text: What's the greatest threat to our still-fragile economic recovery? Dangers abound, of course. But what I currently find most ominous is the spread of a destructive idea: the view that now, less than a year into a weak recovery from the worst slump since World War II, is the time for policy makers to stop helping the jobless and start inflicting pain.
When the financial crisis first struck, most of the world's policy makers responded appropriately, cutting interest rates and allowing deficits to rise. And by doing the right thing, by applying the lessons learned from the 1930s, they managed to limit the damage: It was terrible, but it wasn't a second Great Depression.
Now, however, demands that governments switch from supporting their economies to punishing them have been proliferating in op-eds, speeches and reports from international organizations. Indeed, the idea that what depressed economies really need is even more suffering seems to be the new conventional wisdom, which John Kenneth Galbraith famously defined as "the ideas which are esteemed at any time for their acceptability."
The extent to which inflicting economic pain has become the accepted thing was driven home to me by the latest report on the economic outlook from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, an influential Paris-based think tank supported by the governments of the world's advanced economies. The O.E.C.D. is a deeply cautious organization; what it says at any given time virtually defines that moment's conventional wisdom. And what the O.E.C.D. is saying right now is that policy makers should stop promoting economic recovery and instead begin raising interest rates and slashing spending.
What's particularly remarkable about this recommendation is that it seems disconnected not only from the real needs of the world economy, but from the organization's own economic projections.
Thus, the O.E.C.D. declares that interest rates in the United States and other nations should rise sharply over the next year and a half, so as to head off inflation. Yet inflation is low and declining, and the O.E.C.D.'s own forecasts show no hint of an inflationary threat. So why raise rates?
The answer, as best I can make it out, is that the organization believes that we must worry about the chance that markets might start expecting inflation, even though they shouldn't and currently don't: We must guard against "the possibility that longer-term inflation expectations could become unanchored in the O.E.C.D. economies, contrary to what is assumed in the central projection."
A similar argument is used to justify fiscal austerity. Both textbook economics and experience say that slashing spending when you're still suffering from high unemployment is a really bad idea -- not only does it deepen the slump, but it does little to improve the budget outlook, because much of what governments save by spending less they lose as a weaker economy depresses tax receipts. And the O.E.C.D. predicts that high unemployment will persist for years. Nonetheless, the organization demands both that governments cancel any further plans for economic stimulus and that they begin "fiscal consolidation" next year.
Why do this? Again, to give markets something they shouldn't want and currently don't. Right now, investors don't seem at all worried about the solvency of the U.S. government; the interest rates on federal bonds are near historic lows. And even if markets were worried about U.S. fiscal prospects, spending cuts in the face of a depressed economy would do little to improve those prospects. But cut we must, says the O.E.C.D., because inadequate consolidation efforts "would risk adverse reactions in financial markets."
The best summary I've seen of all this comes from Martin Wolf of The Financial Times, who describes the new conventional wisdom as being that "giving the markets what we think they may want in future -- even though they show little sign of insisting on it now -- should be the ruling idea in policy."
Put that way, it sounds crazy. And it is. Yet it's a view that's spreading. And it's already having ugly consequences. Last week conservative members of the House, invoking the new deficit fears, scaled back a bill extending aid to the long-term unemployed -- and the Senate left town without acting on even the inadequate measures that remained. As a result, many American families are about to lose unemployment benefits, health insurance, or both -- and as these families are forced to slash spending, they will endanger the jobs of many more.
And that's just the beginning. More and more, conventional wisdom says that the responsible thing is to make the unemployed suffer. And while the benefits from inflicting pain are an illusion, the pain itself will be all too real.

Abstract: Honda has an annual capacity of 650,000 cars and minivans in China, like Jazz subcompacts for export to Europe and Accord sedans for the Chinese market. Because Honda's prices in China are similar to what it charges in the United States, the cars tend to be far out of reach financially for most of the workers who make them.

Full text: FOSHAN, China -- After years of being pushed to work 12-hour days, six days a week on monotonous low-wage assembly line tasks, China's workers are starting to push back.
A strike at an enormous Honda transmission factory here in southeastern China has suddenly and unexpectedly turned into a symbol of this nation's struggle with income inequality, rising inflation and soaring property prices that have put home ownership beyond the reach of all but the most affluent.
And perhaps most remarkably, Chinese authorities let the strike happen -- up to a point.
In the kind of scene that more often plays out at strikes in America than at labor actions in China, print and television reporters from state-controlled media across the country have started covering the walkout here, even waiting outside the nearly deserted front gate on Thursday and Friday in hope of any news. All the Chinese reporters disappeared on Saturday morning, however, as the government, apparently nervous, suddenly imposed without explanation a blanket ban on domestic media coverage of the strike.
A worker at a factory dormitory said on Saturday afternoon that the strike continued, and police were nowhere in sight at the factory or the dormitory. The authorities have been leery of letting the media report on labor disputes, fearing that it could encourage workers elsewhere to rebel. The new permissiveness, however temporary, coincides with growing sentiment among some officials and economists that Chinese workers deserve higher wages for their role in the country's global export machine.
And without higher incomes, hundreds of millions of Chinese will be unable to play their part in the domestic consumer spending boom on which this nation hopes to base its next round of economic growth.
"This is all because there is a major political debate going on about how to deal with the nation's growing income gap, and the need to do something about wages," said Andreas Lauffs, a lawyer at Baker & McKenzie who specializes in Chinese labor issues.
If wages do rise, that could bring higher prices for Western consumers for goods as diverse as toys at Wal-Mart and iPads from Apple.
The Chinese media may also have found it a little easier, politically, to cover this strike because Honda is a Japanese company, and anti-Japanese sentiment still simmers in China as a legacy of World War II. Certainly, the strike is hitting Honda hard, as the resulting shortage of transmissions and other engine parts has forced the company to halt production at all four of its assembly plants in China.
Honda has an annual capacity of 650,000 cars and minivans in China, like Jazz subcompacts for export to Europe and Accord sedans for the Chinese market. Because Honda's prices in China are similar to what it charges in the United States, the cars tend to be far out of reach financially for most of the workers who make them.
A Honda spokeswoman declined to discuss specific issues in the strike negotiations.
The intense media coverage may evoke historical memories of the 1980 shipyard strike in Gdansk, Poland, that gave rise to the Solidarity movement and paved the way for the fall of Communism in Eastern Europe. But the reality here is much different.
Instead of tens of thousands of grizzled and angry shipyard workers, the Honda strike involves about 1,900 mostly cheerful young people. And the employees interviewed say their goal is more money, not a larger political agenda.
"If they give us 800 renminbi a month, we'll go back to work right away," said one young man, describing a pay increase that would add about $117 a month to an average pay that is now around $150 monthly. He said he had read on the Internet of considerably higher wages at other factories in China and expected Honda to match them with an immediate pay increase.
Many workers at other factories in southeastern China already earn $300 a month, but they do so only through considerable overtime. And even that higher income is not enough to embark on the middle-class dream in China of owning a small apartment and subcompact car. Officially, though, the government is discouraging heavy reliance on overtime, and workers here said that Honda was not assigning much.
The strikers said that Honda mainly hired recent graduates of high schools or vocational schools. And so, most are in their late teens or early 20s, representing a new generation of employees, many of whom had not been born when the Chinese authorities suppressed protests by students and workers in Tiananmen Square in 1989 -- a watershed event whose 21st anniversary falls next Friday.
The profile of striking workers seems to run more along the lines of slightly bookish would-be engineers -- perhaps without the grades or money to attend college -- rather than political activists. Besides their low wages, the workers seem focused on issues like the factory's air-conditioning not being cool enough, and the unfairness of having to rise from their dormitories as early as 5:30 for a 7 a.m. shift.
Workers said that in addition to their pay, they also received free lodging in rooms that slept four to six in bunk beds. They also get free lunches, subsidized breakfasts for the equivalent of 30 cents and dinners for about $1.50.
The striking employees said that some senior workers, known as team leaders, had allied themselves with management. But they insisted that the rank-and-file workers were solidly in favor of walkout -- a claim impossible to verify.
Although China is run by the Communist Party and has state-controlled unions, the unions are largely charged with overseeing workers, not bargaining for higher wages or pressing for improved labor conditions. And they are not allowed to strike, although China's laws do not have explicit prohibitions against doing so.
Workers at the Honda factory dormitory said that the official union at the factory was not representing them but was serving as an intermediary between them and management. Li Jianming, the national spokesman for the All China Federation of Trade Unions, declined to comment.
The workers here have been on strike since May 21, with no resolution in sight. But the strike did not come to broader notice until Thursday and Friday as Japanese media began reporting the shutdown of Honda assembly plants, and as Chinese media and Internet sites were allowed to report extensively on those activities.
The unusually permissive approach of the authorities toward media coverage of the strike follows a decision to tolerate extensive coverage this month of suicides by workers at the Taiwanese-owned Foxconn factory complex in nearby Shenzhen that supplies Apple and Hewlett-Packard.
The official China Daily newspaper ran a lead editorial on Friday that cited the Honda strike as evidence that government inaction on wages might be fueling tensions between workers and employers. The editorial criticized the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security for not moving faster to draft a promised amendment to current wage regulations because of what the newspaper described as opposition from employers.
Zheng Qiao, the associate director of the department of employment relations at the China Institute of Industrial Relations in Beijing, said the strike was a significant development in China's labor relations history and that "such a large-scale, organized strike will force China's labor union system to change, to adapt to the market economy."

Full text: SEOUL, South Korea -- Over the years, South Korean officials and analysts have grown accustomed to the North Koreans' habit of stirring up trouble, whether through missile launchings or nuclear tests. And when faced with international censure, the North lashes out with threats of retaliation and even war. Typically, it is an attention-getting tactic, the South Koreans say, used to win diplomatic and economic concessions.
But this time the motivation may be different.
Experts on North Korea say that its latest act of belligerence -- the sinking of a South Korean ship in March, one of the worst military provocations since the end of the Korean War in 1953 -- reflects a new force at play: the efforts of the North's leader, Kim Jong-il, to establish his 27-year-old son as a legitimate heir to carry on the family dynasty.
"His succession to power is the factor that links all other factors when we try to explain why the North is doing what it does these days," said Choi Jin-wook, a senior analyst at the Korea Institute for National Unification, the Seoul government's top research organization on North Korea. "Without it, no explanation is complete or convincing."
On the surface, the North's ever-intensifying policy of confrontation can appear self-defeating. But, officials and analysts here say, it is all part of Mr. Kim's effort to groom Kim Jong-un, the youngest of his three known sons, as his successor. According to this line of thinking, the sinking of the South Korean ship was intended to create an atmosphere of crisis that would serve Mr. Kim's purposes, both by rallying public support and winning the crucial backing of the military.
"Kim Jong-il needs to create a warlike atmosphere at home to push through with the succession of power to his son," said Cheon Seong-whun, another senior analyst at the Korea Institute for National Unification. "To do that, he needs tensions and an external enemy."
Mr. Kim himself was carefully groomed for years to succeed his father, Kim Il-sung, who died in 1994. In the years he was consolidating his power base, Kim Jong-il was credited with masterminding a 1968 commando attack on the South Korean presidential palace in Seoul and the 1976 ax killings of two American military officers at the border, said Baek Seung-joo, a North Korea specialist at the Korea Institute for Defense Analyses.
Also in 1968, North Korea captured an American naval intelligence ship, the Pueblo, holding 82 hostages for nearly a year, while its commandos attacked remote South Korean villages and clashed with the South Korean military for two months.
But this latest succession has been thrust upon the Kims prematurely, after Kim Jong-il's reported stroke in 2008 and subsequent health problems. Although Mr. Kim, 68, was healthy enough to visit China this month, questions persist over how long he can remain in power.
The next step for Kim Jong-un is to make his official public debut, but that has been complicated by his lack of major achievements, analysts said.
The elder Mr. Kim "wants to speed up his military-first policy and nuclear program and wants to consolidate the succession process before his health condition becomes worse," a high-ranking South Korean government official told a group of foreign correspondents in Seoul on Friday. "His third son is also rushing because as a member of the new generation, he wants to prove himself to be very strong and able to control the military leadership. In order to do so, he wants to show to the North Korean leadership that he has achieved some major military outcomes, particularly targeted against South Korea."
Of course, the succession issue is not the only problem facing Kim Jong-il. His trademark policy of building a "strong and prosperous nation" was called into question when his navy lost a humiliating skirmish against the South last November. His government's recent attempt to arrest inflation and eliminate black markets through a drastic revaluation of the North Korean currency set off more inflation and a wave of popular discontent that extended beyond the capital, Pyongyang.
Meanwhile, South Korea refused to offer economic incentives until the North gave up its nuclear weapons program.
With the succession issue and the rising internal and external pressures, it is not surprising that Mr. Kim would ratchet up confrontation with the South and its allies, said Mr. Cheon, the analyst. North Korea's propaganda machine uses international condemnation to strengthen internal solidarity, he said.
North Korea is now telling its people that the United States and South Korea fabricated the sinking of the South's ship as a version of the "Gulf of Tonkin incident," a battle that Washington vastly overstated to justify expanding the Vietnam War. Huge outdoor rallies are being mobilized in the North, according to North Korea Intellectuals Solidarity, a Web site run by defectors from the North, which cited sources inside North Korea.
Last week, using a radio network that reaches every North Korean home, Gen. O Kuk-ryol, a top officer, delivered Mr. Kim's order to the military and reserve forces to be ready for combat, said the defectors' Web site.
But Mr. Kim's most concerted efforts seem to be directed at the military, the critical power base for his son. Despite United Nations sanctions that ban exports of luxury goods to the North, Mr. Kim is believed to have smuggled in fancy foreign cars for loyal generals, and in April 100 senior officers received promotions.
Ha Tae-keung, who runs Open Radio for North Korea, a Web site based in Seoul that collects news from informants inside the North, said that Mr. Kim's tactics seemed to be succeeding. "I think the son is firmly in place," he said. "He was in charge in Pyongyang when his father and his top aides were all in China."

Abstract: With more than 70 percent of the economy composed of consumer spending, economists are pinning their hopes for a sustainable economic recovery on robust buying by households, much of which depends on consumer sentiment and job creation.

Full text: The United States economy expanded at a slower rate in the first quarter than originally estimated, the Commerce Department reported Thursday, partly because of a slight decrease in the pace of consumer spending.
But the status of the recovery still hinges on the prospects for job growth, analysts said.
The revised measure of the overall economy grew at an inflation-adjusted annual rate of 3 percent in the first quarter, down from the earlier estimate of 3.2 percent, the department said. Economists had forecast growth of 3.5 percent.
"The economy is still showing above-trend growth in the first quarter and we think the economy is continuing to grow," said Michael Feroli, the United States economist for JP Morgan Economics. The 3 percent growth follows 5.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2009 and 2.2 percent in the third.
One contributing factor to the revision was consumer spending, which was lowered to 3.5 percent from 3.6 percent. Other factors in the revision included a decline in the purchases of business equipment and software and a sharp increase in imports, which helped widen the trade deficit. Spending on durable goods, like cars, grew 12.2 percent in the first quarter, compared with 0.4 percent in the previous three months.
With more than 70 percent of the economy composed of consumer spending, economists are pinning their hopes for a sustainable economic recovery on robust buying by households, much of which depends on consumer sentiment and job creation.
Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist for MFR, said that the latest gross domestic product figures confirmed his view that the economy was growing at a moderate pace, albeit aided by government stimulus. Mr. Shapiro said he expected overall annualized growth of 2.5 to 3 percent for the rest of the year.
The biggest debate, he said, is over the path of the recovery of the labor market and how it helps consumers to promote growth. "An enormous amount hinges on the rate of job growth that we are going to see on a sustained basis," he said. The economy added 290,000 jobs in April, the largest gain in four years, in a broad swath of industries.
Still, the Labor Department said on Friday that initial jobless claims fell slightly to 460,000 in the week of May 22, down by 14,000. While the weekly level exceeded analysts' expectations, total jobless claims still inspired a sober outlook.
"We continue to believe that an imminent and sustained burst of hiring sufficient to meaningfully impact the unemployment rate remains elusive," Dan Greenhaus, the chief economic strategist for Miller Tabak & Company, wrote in a research note.
The latest job figures have been inflated by the hiring of temporary workers for the census, and Mr. Shapiro said those workers would continue to add to payrolls in the next few months.
The first-quarter G.D.P. rate also showed downward revisions of government spending. Federal government spending grew at an annualized rate of 1.2 percent in the first quarter, down from the original estimate of 1.4 percent. Local and state governments continued to cut spending for the third consecutive quarter.

Abstract: The United States appears to be in a stronger position than the euro area, he said, helped by better financial market conditions and "a number of more favorable elements on the fiscal side," notably the outlook for stronger tax revenues, which means it can delay debt reduction steps until 2015.

Full text: PARIS -- Just as economic growth is gathering steam globally, the threat of overheating in parts of Asia and Europe's budget deficit woes are raising warning signs, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said Wednesday.
In its twice-yearly Economic Outlook, the O.E.C.D. raised its growth forecasts for the major economies: the United States, Europe and Japan. The rebound from last year's downturn is being driven by an increase in trade, booming emerging markets, the continued support of government stimulus policies -- now starting to be unwound -- a housing market recovery in some countries and improved market conditions, the report said.
"These developments bode well for a recovery in the whole O.E.C.D. area," the organization's secretary-general, Angel Gurria, said.
Gross domestic product across the O.E.C.D.'s 31 members was projected to grow by 2.7 percent this year and by 2.8 percent in 2011. Those were revised upward from the November forecasts of 1.9 percent in 2010 and 2.5 percent next year.
"We're slowly moving from a policy-driven recovery to a self-sustaining recovery," the organization's chief economist, Pier Carlo Padoan, said in an interview.
The United States appears to be in a stronger position than the euro area, he said, helped by better financial market conditions and "a number of more favorable elements on the fiscal side," notably the outlook for stronger tax revenues, which means it can delay debt reduction steps until 2015.
At the same time, the shift in liquidity from developed markets to such places as China and India, and the weak fiscal position of the euro-area countries present risks, the report stressed.
"As activity gathers momentum, global imbalances are beginning to widen again," it said, citing in particular the "magnitude of capital inflows in emerging-market economies and instability in sovereign debt markets."
The recent debt crisis centered in Europe has "highlighted the need for the euro area to strengthen significantly its institutional and operational architecture to dissipate doubts about the long-term viability of the monetary union," the O.E.C.D. said. "At a minimum, surveillance of domestic policies needs to be strengthened, taking on board broader competitiveness considerations."
Mr. Padoan noted that there had been an "acceleration in the sense of urgency" among European countries to try to bring their deficits under control. Yet despite the recent spate of announcements, most of the policies will not take effect until next year.
And these efforts may not be enough to avoid continued volatility in debt markets, the report warned. "Bolder measures need to be taken to ensure fiscal discipline, along a continuum that ranges from stronger surveillance and more effective sanctions for non-compliance, to external auditing of national budgets, all the way to de facto fiscal union."
Mr. Padoan cautioned that it was wiser for countries like Spain, France and Britain, which are trying to rein in long-term liabilities, to focus on raising revenue through indirect or consumption-related taxes, rather than higher direct taxes, which can have a more harmful effect on growth.
"The whole continent must change its political morale and perhaps its social welfare and state model," Giulio Tremonti, the finance minister of Italy, told an economic forum at the O.E.C.D. "We are confronted with hard choices. The public coffers are not unlimited."
Italy became the latest euro-area country to announce austerity measures when it proposed budget cuts Tuesday aiming to cut its deficit to below 3 percent of G.D.P. by 2012, from 5.3 percent last year. The measures center on cuts to public spending; no new taxes will be introduced and no existing taxes will be raised.
Mr. Tremonti said the government's aim was to "maintain what is necessary for social cohesion." As a result, it did not plan to reduce spending on health and social security, but instead would seek less spending at the regional and municipal level while "better integrating" central services.
On a more positive note for the region, the recent decline in the euro could help the outlook, by lifting the competitiveness of exporters. "The euro was bit overvalued," Mr. Padoan said, adding its decline will help "rebalance" global economic disequilibrium.
Here, China can also play a role by allowing its currency to climb, Mr. Padoan said, describing such a move as "low hanging fruit" for the authorities. That, and lower interest rates, would help to offset rising inflation pressure in China and reduce the risk of an economic hard landing, after years of surging growth rates.
The report forecast a moderate decline in Chinese growth to 9.7 percent next year, from 11.1 percent this year, with consumer prices steady at an annual rise of 2.5 percent for both years.
"Overheating in emerging-market economies also poses a serious risk," the report said. "A boom-bust scenario cannot be ruled out, requiring a much stronger tightening of monetary policy in some non-O.E.C.D. countries, including China and India, to counter inflationary pressures and reduce the risk of asset-price bubbles."
The O.E.C.D. said that given these risks, monetary policy in advanced economies needs to be "normalized," after a period where central banks took extraordinary steps to inject cash into the system to prevent a collapse of the financial system. Support is already being removed in several countries and exit strategies must take into account nascent fiscal consolidation "so as to facilitate it without putting undue pressure on interest rates."
Over all, the organization said that the outlook for inflation remains "benign" in the advanced economies due to considerable economic slack. The main risk of inflation becoming "unanchored" is if strong growth in emerging-market economies keeps pushing up energy and commodity prices.
The report forecast real growth in gross domestic product in the United States of 3.2 percent this year and next year. That was higher than a forecast made in November of 2.5 percent this year and 2.8 percent in 2011. The U.S. jobless rate is expected by the O.E.C.D. to fall to 8.9 percent in 2011 from 9.7 percent this year.
"The Federal Reserve and the administration should gradually with draw policy stimulus as economic growth becomes self-sustaining," the report said
Growth in the euro-area was estimated at 1.2 percent this year and 1.8 percent next year. That was an improvement from the November figure of 0.9 percent this year and 1.7 percent next year. Unemployment will remain high in the region, at 10.1 percent next year, it said.
For Britain, the O.E.C.D. forecast growth of 1.3 percent this year, held back by high inflation and lingering effects of the credit crunch, before rising to 2.5 percent next year, when household consumption and business investment start to build momentum. Inflation should start to fall back next year as the effects of a recent sales tax increase start to wane
For Japan, the economy was forecast to expand 3 percent this year and 2 percent in 2011. The recovery has been driven by exports, despite the significant appreciation of the yen, and fiscal stimulus.
The O.E.C.D. said the Bank of Japan should keep its ultra-loose monetary stance until "underlying inflation is firmly positive."
For India, the organization forecast strong growth rates of 8.3 percent this year and 8.5 percent next year. Brazilian G.D.P. was forecast togrow 6.5 percent this year and 5 percent next year.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Abstract: According to the Bank for International Settlements, the United States' structural deficit -- the amount of our deficit adjusted for the economic cycle -- has increased from 3.1 percent of gross domestic product in 2007 to 9.2 percent in 2010.

Full text: ARE you worried that we are passing our debt on to future generations? Well, you need not worry.
Before this recession it appeared that absent action, the government's long-term commitments would become a problem in a few decades. I believe the government response to the recession has created budgetary stress sufficient to bring about the crisis much sooner. Our generation -- not our grandchildren's -- will have to deal with the consequences.
According to the Bank for International Settlements, the United States' structural deficit -- the amount of our deficit adjusted for the economic cycle -- has increased from 3.1 percent of gross domestic product in 2007 to 9.2 percent in 2010. This does not take into account the very large liabilities the government has taken on by socializing losses in the housing market. We have not seen the bills for bailing out Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and even more so the Federal Housing Administration, which is issuing government-guaranteed loans to non-creditworthy borrowers on terms easier than anything offered during the housing bubble. Government accounting is done on a cash basis, so promises to pay in the future -- whether Social Security benefits or loan guarantees -- do not count in the budget until the money goes out the door.
A good percentage of the structural increase in the deficit is because last year's "stimulus" was not stimulus in the traditional sense. Rather than a one-time injection of spending to replace a cyclical reduction in private demand, the vast majority of the stimulus has been a permanent increase in the base level of government spending -- including spending on federal jobs. How different is the government today from what General Motors was a decade ago? Government employees are expensive and difficult to fire. Bloomberg News reported that from the last peak businesses have let go 8.5 million people, or 7.4 percent of the work force, while local governments have cut only 141,000 workers, or less than 1 percent.
Public sector jobs used to offer greater job security but lower pay. Not anymore. In 2008, according to the Cato Institute, the average federal civilian salary with benefits was $119,982, compared with $59,909 for the average private sector worker; the disparity has grown enormously over the last decade.
The question we need to ask is this: If we don't change direction, how long can we travel down this path without having a crisis? The answer lies in two critical issues. First, how long will the capital markets continue to finance government borrowings that may be refinanced but never repaid on reasonable terms? And second, to what extent can obligations that are not financed through traditional fiscal means be satisfied through central bank monetization of debts -- that is, by the printing of money?

The recent United States credit crisis was attributable in large measure to capital requirements and risk models that incorrectly assumed AAA-rated securities were exempt from default risk. We learned the hard way that when the market ignores credit risk, the behavior of borrowers and lenders becomes distorted.
It was once unthinkable that "risk-free" institutions could fail -- so unthinkable that the chief executives of the companies that recently did fail probably didn't realize when they crossed the line from highly creditworthy to eventually insolvent. Surely, had they seen the line, they would, to a man, have stopped on the solvent side.
Our government leaders are faced with the same risk today. At what level of government debt and future commitments does government default go from being unthinkable to inevitable, and how does our government think about that risk?
I recently posed this question to one of the president's senior economic advisers. He answered that the government is different from financial institutions because it can print money, and statistically the United States is not as bad off as some other countries. For an investor, these responses do not inspire confidence.
He went on to say that the government needs to focus on jobs now, because without an economic recovery, the rest does not matter. It's a valid point, but an insufficient excuse for holding off on addressing the long-term structural deficit. If we are going to spend more now, it is imperative that we lay out a credible plan to avoid falling into a debt trap. Even using the administration's optimistic 10-year forecast, it is clear that we will have problematic deficits for the next decade, which ends just as our commitments to baby boomers accelerate.
Modern Keynesianism works great until it doesn't. No one really knows where the line is. One obvious lesson from the economic crisis is that we should get rid of the official credit ratings that inspire false confidence and, worse, are pro-cyclical, aggravating slowdowns and inflating booms. Congress has a rare opportunity in the current regulatory reform effort to eliminate the rating system. For now, it does not appear interested in taking sufficiently aggressive action. The big banks and bond buyers have told Congress they want to continue the current system.
As William Gross, the managing director of the bond management company Pimco, put it in his last newsletter, "Firms such as Pimco with large credit staffs of their own can bypass, anticipate and front run all three [rating agencies], benefiting from their timidity and lack of common sense."
Given how sophisticated bond buyers use the credit rating system to take advantage of more passive market participants, it is no wonder they stress the continued need to preserve the status quo.
It would be better to have each investor individually assess credit-seeking entities. Certainly, the creditworthiness of governments should not be determined by a couple of rating agency committees.
Consider this: When Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner promises that the United States will never lose its AAA rating, he chooses to become dependent on the whims of the Standard & Poor's ratings committee rather than the diverse views of the many participants in the capital markets. It is not hard to imagine a crisis where just as the Treasury secretary seeks buyers of government debt in the face of deteriorating market confidence, a rating agency issues an untimely downgrade, setting off a rush of sales by existing bondholders. This has been the experience of many troubled corporations, where downgrades served as the coup de grace.
The current upset in the European sovereign debt market is a prequel to what might happen here. Banks can hold government debt with a so-called zero-risk weighting, which means zero capital requirements. As a result, European banks stocked up on Greek debt, and sold sovereign credit default swaps, and now need to be bailed out to avoid another banking crisis.
As we saw first in Dubai and now in Greece, it appears that governments' response to the failure of Lehman Brothers. is to use any means necessary to avoid another Lehman-like event. This policy transfers risk from the weak to the strong -- or at least the less weak -- setting up the possibility of the crisis ultimately spreading from the "too small to fails," like Greece, to "too big to bails," like members of the Group of 7 industrialized nations.
We should have learned by now that each credit -- no matter how unthinkable its failure would be -- has risk and requires capital. Just as trivial capital charges encouraged lenders and borrowers to overdo it with AAA-rated collateral debt obligations, the same flawed structure in the government debt market encourages and therefore practically ensures a repeat of this behavior -- leading to an even larger crisis.

I don't believe a United States debt default is inevitable. On the other hand, I don't see the political will to steer the country away from crisis. If we wait until the markets force action, as they have in Greece, we might find ourselves negotiating austerity programs with foreign creditors.
Some believe this could be avoided by printing money. Despite the promises by the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben Bernanke, not to print money or "monetize" the debt, when push comes to shove, there is a good chance the Fed will do so, at least to the point where significant inflation shows up even in government statistics.
That the recent round of money printing has not led to headline inflation may give central bankers the confidence that they can pursue this course without inflationary consequences. However, printing money can go only so far without creating inflation.
Government statistics are about the last place one should look to find inflation, as they are designed to not show much. Over the last 35 years the government has changed the way it calculates inflation several times. According to the Web site Shadow Government Statistics, using the pre-1980 method, the Consumer Price Index would be over 9 percent, compared with about 2 percent in the official statistics today.
While the truth probably lies somewhere in the middle, this doesn't even take into account inflation we ignore by using a basket of goods that don't match the real-world cost of living. (For example, health care costs are one-sixth of G.D.P. but only one-sixteenth of the price index, and rising income and payroll taxes do not count as inflation at all.)
Why does the government understate rising costs? Low official inflation benefits the government by reducing inflation-indexed payments, including Social Security. Lower official inflation means higher reported real G.D.P., higher reported real income and higher reported productivity.
Subdued reported inflation also enables the Fed to rationalize easy money. The Fed wants to have low interest rates to fight unemployment, which, in a new version of the trickle-down theory, it believes can be addressed through higher stock prices. The Fed hopes that by denying savers an adequate return in risk-free assets like savings deposits, it will force them to speculate in stocks and other "risky assets." This speculation drives stock prices higher, which creates a "wealth effect" when the lucky speculators spend some of their gains on goods and services. The purchases increase aggregate demand and lead to job creation.
Easy money also aids the banks, helping them earn back their still unacknowledged losses. This has the perverse effect of discouraging banks from making new loans. If banks can lend to the government, with no capital charge and no perceived risk and earn an adequate spread, then they have little incentive to lend to small businesses or consumers. (For this reason, higher short-term rates could very well stimulate additional lending to the private sector.)
Easy money also helps the fiscal position of the government. Lower borrowing costs mean lower deficits. In effect, negative real interest rates are indirect debt monetization. Allowing borrowers, including the government, to get addicted to unsustainably low rates creates enormous solvency risks when rates eventually rise.
While one can debate where we are in the recovery, one thing is clear -- the worst of the last crisis has passed. Nominal G.D.P. growth is running in the mid-single digits. The emergency has passed and yet the Fed continues with an emergency zero-interest rate policy. Perhaps easy money is still appropriate -- but a zero-rate policy creates enormous distortions in incentives and increases the likelihood of a significant crisis later. It was not lost on the market that during this month's sell-off, with rates around zero, there is no room for further cuts should the economy roll over.
EASY money has negative consequences in addition to the risk of inflation and devaluing the dollar. It can also feed asset bubbles. In recent years, we have gone from one bubble and bailout to the next. Each bailout has rewarded those who acted imprudently. This has encouraged additional risky behavior, feeding the creation of new, larger bubbles.
The Fed bailed out the equity markets after the crash of 1987, which fed a boom ending with the Mexican crisis and bailout. That Treasury-financed bailout started a bubble in emerging market debt, which ended with the Asian currency crisis and Russian default. The resulting organized rescue of Long-Term Capital Management's counterparties spurred the Internet bubble. After that popped, the rescue led to the housing and credit bubble. The deflationary aspects of that bubble popping created a bubble in sovereign debt, despite the fiscal strains created by the bailouts. The Greek crisis may be the first sign of the sovereign debt bubble bursting.
Though we don't know what's going to happen next, the good news for our grandchildren is that we will have to face our own debts. If we realize that our own future is at risk, we might be more serious about changing course. If we don't, Mr. Geithner and others might regret having never said never about America's rating.

Full text: NEW DELHI -- Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said Monday that India must reach 10 percent annual economic growth in coming years and improve relations with Pakistan if it wants to reduce poverty and make more rapid progress.
Mr. Singh, who has staked his personal prestige on improving ties with Pakistan, said India was working to restore trust with Pakistan so that more serious negotiations could resume on the full range of disputed issues between the nuclear-armed neighbors.
In July, the foreign ministers of both countries will meet in Islamabad, the Pakistani capital, in another attempt to rebuild the diplomatic ties shattered by the 2008 terrorist attack in Mumbai, India, by militants based in Pakistan.
"This will be the first major effort to deal with the underlying causes -- that is, lack of adequate trust between our two countries," Mr. Singh told reporters, noting that any progress was contingent on Pakistan's stopping attacks against India by terrorist groups within its borders. He added, "I'm hopeful this process can move forward."
Mr. Singh's comments came during a wide-ranging news conference on the anniversary of India's coalition national government, which is led by his Congress Party. After taking power amid great expectations last May, the new government, known as the United Progressive Alliance II, has had a mixed early record, having successfully steered the economy out of the global recession even as Indians have grown angry over high inflation.
Mr. Singh, 77, argued that India had done better than almost every other major economy in blunting the impact of the global downturn -- with growth projected at 8.5 percent for the new fiscal year following a record drought in 2009. He predicted that inflation, currently near double digits, would fall to between 5 percent and 6 percent by December.
But he also acknowledged that the government's performance had not been perfect.
"I would be the first person to admit that we could have done more," Mr. Singh said in a prepared statement.
Mr. Singh does not often hold major news conferences, and his appearance came as the government was being criticized for its inability to thwart deadly attacks by Maoist rebels operating in the Indian countryside. Earlier this month, militants blew up a passenger bus loaded with police officers and civilians, killing at least 31 people. Last month, Maoists killed 75 paramilitary officers during an ambush in a remote forest.
Mr. Singh denied that the central government had underestimated the Maoists, noting that for the past three years he had called them India's gravest internal security threat. India's future prosperity hinged on curbing the Maoists, he said, adding that the national government was coordinating a response with state governments, who are at the forefront of the police response.
Mr. Singh also swatted away the speculation that has ebbed and flowed in Indian political circles of a chill between himself and Sonia Gandhi, president of the Congress Party. It was Mrs. Gandhi who installed Mr. Singh as prime minister when Congress first regained power in 2004 through the first United Progressive Alliance government, and their close working relationship had been considered critical to the party's success.
Mr. Singh, a former economist, is the face of the pro-growth wing of the party, analysts say, while Mrs. Gandhi focuses on political work and social issues, like national projects to provide work, food and education to the rural poor. But some analysts suspected a rift between them in recent months, and some members of the Congress Party grumbled that the prime minister was not dedicating enough attention to social causes.
When Mrs. Gandhi was reinstated to a cabinet-level position as leader of a national advisory group on social issues, some political commentators interpreted the move as a deliberate curbing of the prime minister's authority.
"There is not an iota of truth that there is an element of distrust or mistrust between me and the president of the Congress," Mr. Singh said.
In a lighter moment, one journalist noted that the prime minister was advised by two powerful women -- Mrs. Gandhi and his wife -- and he was asked whose advice he favored. The prime minister said he was "privileged" to benefit from their advice.
"Both of them deal with different subjects," he said, "and I welcome the advice from both of them."

Abstract: According to a recent analysis by Citigroup, Britain's structural deficit -- meaning the part of the budget gap that will not close even when the economy improves -- was 9.2 percent of G.D.P. last year, ranking third in the world behind rapidly aging Japan and almost bankrupt Greece.

Full text: LONDON -- As governments from Greece to Portugal to Spain try to sell markets on their budget-cutting zeal, the country that may face the biggest hurdle is Britain.
Propelled by a robust economy that finally collapsed in 2008, Britain's spending boom was the most expansive in Europe, producing a welter of shiny hospitals, school buildings and highways, along with a cadre of well-paid public sector officials.
Now the new government must unwind not so much the debt incurred from two years of economic stimulus efforts, but more broadly, the structural deficits built up over more than a decade of expanded health care, education and pension commitments.
Prime Minister David Cameron has talked boldly of closing a British budget deficit now equal to 11 percent of its gross domestic product. But he also has said that he will allow health spending to outpace inflation, continuing a trend started by the Labour government that has doubled the cost of the government's elephantine National Health Service since 2000.
It is this apparent disconnect between the promises of politicians and the harsh demands of investors for immediate and across the board spending cuts that is at the root of the financial crisis in Europe today.
Even after the nearly $1 trillion rescue package arranged by European Union leaders to shore up the weaker euro zone members, financial markets have gyrated as fears build that debt-plagued nations lack the will to stand up to powerful unions and pare back once generous welfare programs.
"You need a martyr to cut this type of deficit," said Andrew Lilico, chief economist at Policy Exchange, a right-leaning London research group, who has argued that quick and immediate spending cuts would actually hasten economic recovery rather than derail it.
"You need someone to say, 'I will do the right thing and everyone will hate me.' "
According to a recent analysis by Citigroup, Britain's structural deficit -- meaning the part of the budget gap that will not close even when the economy improves -- was 9.2 percent of G.D.P. last year, ranking third in the world behind rapidly aging Japan and almost bankrupt Greece.
As is the case with other countries in Europe, like Spain, Greece and Ireland, Britain has a deficit that has grown mostly because of a decade of rising government outlays that seemed reasonable at the time, but rested heavily on rising tax revenue that disappeared when the bubble burst.
In a recent report, the International Monetary Fund warned that the countries that would have to make the biggest sacrifices in spending cuts and tax increases to return to precrisis levels of indebtedness -- Britain, France, Ireland, Spain and the United States -- also face the biggest increase in spending demands. These are driven by the rising number of the elderly, thus making the cuts all the harder to impose.
"All developed economies now have in-built structural components in their government deficits due to having pension and health systems and aging populations," said Edward Hugh, an independent economist based in Barcelona. "And these costs will go up by the year."
The British chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, who has long urged the Conservative Party to trim the deficit, said on Monday that he would push through $:6 billion ($8.65 billion) in spending cuts.
Though decidedly modest when compared with a budget deficit estimated to be about $:178 billion, the cuts represent an effort to convince skittish markets that Mr. Cameron's team is committed to fiscal restraint.
The latest menu of restrictions, freezes and spending reversals also represents an effort to convince the public that Britain must be in tune with the budget-cutting in Greece, Portugal, Spain and other parts of Europe.
"The years of public sector plenty are over," Mr. Osborne said. "The more decisively we act, the more quickly we can come through these tough times."
Mr. Cameron has fulminated publicly about cutting public sector pay and decreed that members of Parliament themselves take a 5 percent pay cut.
But it remains unclear whether he can force significant savings in what has become in many respects a public sector aristocracy of elite civil servants, heads of national railroads and top officials of obscure agencies, like the National Policing Improvement Agency and the Horserace Betting Levy Board. The heads of those two agencies, for example, were paid salaries last year that exceed Mr. Cameron's pay of $:197,000 (about $284,000) -- $:211,831 and $:220,665, respectively.
Among the highest paid have been administrators and doctors within the country's government-financed National Health Service, which has become its own separate economy with its 1.7 million employees and $:100 billion plus budget.
For example, David Taube, a doctor, administrator and medical director for five hospitals comprising the Imperial College Healthcare N.H.S. Trust, was paid $:260,000 (about $375,000) at the exchange rates last year. That is also more than the prime minister received.
According to the TaxPayers' Alliance, an advocacy group for spending cuts, the highest-paid 805 government employees in Britain received a 5.4 percent pay increase last year, with the average official taking in $:209,224.
Whether it be the $:1.3 million paid to the chief executive of the Royal Mail, the $:267,000 for the head of information technology in the Department for Work and Pensions, or the $:270,000 earned this year by the chief executive of the Guy's and St. Thomas Hospitals in London, the galloping pay of public sector workers in Britain has become a major component of the structural deficit and shows little sign of letting up.
"We have been doing this for five years now, and the numbers just get bigger and bigger," said John O'Connell, an analyst at the TaxPayers' Alliance.
Starting in 2000, the Labour government made it a priority to improve the N.H.S.'s lackluster reputation and invested billions in bricks and mortar as well as the salaries of its growing ranks of doctors and administrators.
Health care spending in Britain soared to 9 percent of G.D.P. from 3 percent. The image of the service has been transformed from one that exemplified drab inefficiencies of the British state to what is now hailed as a world archetype, even by Conservative politicians like Mr. Cameron.
As for Dr. Taube, a spokeswoman for the Imperial College Healthcare N.H.S. Trust said that he was a leading renal clinician and that the bulk of his salary, $:180,000 to $:185,000, came from his clinical work. He was paid an additional $:75,000 to $:80,000 for his administrative duties.
Now the new government must wrestle with whether it can restrain such pay and spending and at what political cost.

Full text: To fib is human. Each of us tells little lies to make it through the day, and an indistinct line divides fair from foul.
Which side of the line is Richard Blumenthal on? Mr. Blumenthal, the Connecticut attorney general, is running for the United States Senate, and an article in The New York Times last week revealed that he has mischaracterized his service in the United States Marine Corps on occasion, by suggesting that he served in Vietnam during the years of combat instead of his stateside duty in the Marine Reserve.
His supporters say that Mr. Blumenthal's misstatements have been simply slips, and that he stated quite clearly several times that he had not served in Vietnam.
But Mr. Blumenthal himself has acknowledged misspeaking, and his friend Christopher Shays, a former congressman, said he had noticed Mr. Blumenthal's description of his service growing in the telling, over time. "More and more it kept creeping in," he said. "He just kept adding to the story."
If Mr. Blumenthal engaged in personal puffery, he's got plenty of company. No one recommends lying on one's resume, but in an age when we are all told to burnish our personal brand, a little padding won't raise an eyebrow. It's just that some go farther than others -- to outright fraud.
Contrast Mr. Blumenthal's missteps, for example, to the case of Wes Cooley, a one-term congressman from Oregon who in 1997 was convicted of making a false claim in an official document, a voters' guide; he had falsely claimed to have served in the Army Special Forces in Korea in the early 1950s. Or consider the indictment last week of Adam Wheeler, a Delaware man accused by Massachusetts authorities of fabricating much of the transfer application that earned him acceptance to Harvard in 2007, with nearly $50,000 in aid.
White-out is the new black: Loren Elliotte Friedman was recently suspended from the practice of law after a 2002 incident in which he improved his first-year transcripts from the University of Chicago law school to get a coveted summer job with the law firm Sidley Austin.
Lying starts young, and experts suggest that it might even be part of what makes us human.
"In the normal developmental process -- beginning in early childhood -- the discovery that one can lie is a significant advance in personal growth and development," said Jay S. Kwawer, director of the William Alanson White Institute of Psychiatry, Psychoanalysis and Psychology in New York. From the age of 4, the ability to say, "It wasn't me," or more complex confabulations, he said, "fuels the development of fantasy life, creativity, and is often at the core of play and drama: 'I can fly!' 'Bang, bang, you're dead!' 'Let's play house.' "
In other words, lying is the foundation of fiction itself. "Within certain normal limits, there's nothing pathological about that at all," he said.
As we grow up, we find that small lies become an essential part of the day, said Paul Begala, a former aide to President Bill Clinton. "Telling your mother-in-law you love her casserole is a lie, but the harm is zero and the intent is noble, so it's a good lie," he said.
Lawyers can be at particular risk of pushing the boundaries of acceptable spinning, said Stephen Gillers, an law professor and an expert on legal ethics at New York University.
Their legal training and experience in practice, he said, reinforce the notion that "a fact becomes true if a jury or opponent can be persuaded to think that it is true -- even if it is false." Lawyers and politicians alike, he said, "work this alchemy through performance."
Politicians, too, have incentives to embellish, Dr. Kwawer said. "Politicians thrive and get elected on the basis of being able to suss out what we want to hear, and telling us what we will vote for whether they believe it or not."
The danger for those in politics is the "happy mental aquarium," said Eric Dezenhall, a crisis communications consultant; he means the artificial environment of support and adoration that seems seductively safe. Add to that feeling of specialness an urge to prove that specialness by taking risks -- think Eliot Spitzer or John Edwards, he suggested -- and it's easy to slip into trouble.
But how could someone lie about the facts of his own life when so much data is easily findable in the age of the Internet?
While many of us live with some version of the imposter syndrome, fearing that we are frauds who will be found out at any moment, the resume fabulist comes to believe his own lies, said Seth Aronson, a colleague of Dr. Kwawer at the White Institute. "They buy into this inflated, false sense of self that they build up," he said.
Getting caught is often a matter of chance -- as with embezzlement and fraud, people almost never get caught with the first, cautious misstep. Their lies are discovered after they have successfully avoided detection again and again, having gotten sloppy and finally committing a whopper too big to ignore.
In some cases, Dr. Aronson said, the act of inflation turns out to have been illusory. Mr. Friedman, for example, had been asked by Sidley to sign on after his successful summer. He joined another firm, where he had worked successfully until the fraud came out.
"With a fair number of these people, they are very good," Dr. Aronson said. "That's the irony -- if they just went on their accomplishments and who they were they'd be fine."

Abstract: First came a stimulus bill that, while aimed mainly at ending a deep recession, also set out to remake the nation's educational system and vastly expand scientific research. Since 1980, median household income has risen only 30 percent, adjusted for inflation, while average incomes at the top have tripled or quadrupled.

Full text: WASHINGTON
With the Senate's passage of financial regulation, Congress and the White House have completed 16 months of activity that rival any other since the New Deal in scope or ambition. Like the Reagan Revolution or Lyndon Johnson's Great Society, the new progressive period has the makings of a generational shift in how Washington operates.
First came a stimulus bill that, while aimed mainly at ending a deep recession, also set out to remake the nation's educational system and vastly expand scientific research. Then President Obama signed a health care bill that was the biggest expansion of the safety net in 40 years. And now Congress is in the final stages of a bill that would tighten Wall Street's rules and probably shrink its profit margins.
If there is a theme to all this, it has been to try to lift economic growth while also reducing income inequality. Growth in the decade that just ended was the slowest in the post-World War II era, while inequality has been rising for most of the last 35 years.
It is far too early to know if these efforts will work. Their success depends enormously on execution and, in the case of financial regulation, specifically on the Federal Reserve, which did not distinguish itself during the housing bubble.
Already, though, one downside to the legislative spurt does seem clear. By focusing on long-term problems, Mr. Obama and the Democrats have given less than their full attention to the economy's current weakness and turned off a good number of voters.
After months of discussion, and with the unemployment rate hovering near a 27-year high, Democratic leaders said Thursday they had finally reached agreement on a bill that would send aid to states and take other steps to increase job growth. Congress plans to vote on the bill next week. But some of the money will not be spent for months and may not be enough to affect voters' attitudes before November's midterm elections.
Still, the turnabout since Jan. 20 -- the first anniversary of Mr. Obama's inauguration and the day after Scott Brown, a Republican, won a Senate seat in liberal Massachusetts -- has been remarkable. Then, commentators pronounced the Obama presidency nearly dead. Today, he looks more like a liberal answer to Ronald Reagan.
"If you'd asked me about this administration after Scott Brown was elected, I'd have told you it was going to fizzle into virtually nothing," said Theda Skocpol, the Harvard political scientist. "Now it could easily be one of the pivotal periods in domestic policy." But, Ms. Skocpol added, "It will depend on what happens in the next two elections."
The recent period surely will not match the impact of the New Deal. Nothing is likely to, notes David Kennedy,a Pulitzer Prize-winning historian, because the New Deal created much of the modern American government. "These are not as dramatic as the foundational moments," Mr. Kennedy said, "but they're significant changes."
Alan Brinkley, a historian of the Depression, added: "This is not the New Deal, but it's a significant series of achievements. And given the difficulty of getting anything done under the gridlock of Congress, it's pretty surprising."
The last 16 months seem most similar in scope to three other periods in the last 80 years. After World War II, the federal government helped build the modern middle class with the G.I. Bill, housing subsidies, the highway system and incentives for employers to offer health insurance. The 1960s -- mostly under Mr. Johnson, but also Richard Nixon -- brought civil rights legislation, Medicare, Medicaid and environmental laws. Then Mr. Reagan ushered in a period that continued, more or less, until 2008: tax cuts, less regulation and other attempts to unleash the competitive forces of the market.
Mr. Obama has been trying to reverse the Reagan thrust in some important ways. Although the Reagan administration did not shrink the size of the federal government, it changed the ways that Washington collected and spent its money, by reducing taxes on the affluent, cutting some social programs and increasing military spending.
These policies ended up magnifying income inequality, which was already rising for other reasons. Since 1980, median household income has risen only 30 percent, adjusted for inflation, while average incomes at the top have tripled or quadrupled. Every major piece of the Obama agenda is meant, in part, to push back against inequality. Government may grow, but the bigger change will be how the government is spending its money.
The health bill expanded insurance coverage largely for middle-class and poor families and paid some of the bill by taxing households making more than $250,000 a year. Attached to the final health bill were also education provisions that cut subsidies to banks making student loans, and used much of the money for college financial aid instead.
The financial regulation bill, meanwhile, would take several steps likely to reduce Wall Street's profits -- and Wall Street has created more multimillionaires in recent decades than any other industry. To take one example, certain trades would be forced onto open exchanges. This would hurt financial firms' ability to act as a middleman, much as Expedia and other travel Web sites have hurt travel agents.
For all these differences, though, there are also ways that Mr. Obama and today's Democrats have accepted, and are even furthering, the Reagan project. They are not trying to raise tax rates on the affluent to anywhere near their pre-1981 levels. Their health bill tried created new private insurance markets, not expand Medicare.
Most striking, the administration is trying to improve public education by introducing more market competition. To win stimulus funds, about 20 states have changed their rules to allow more charter schools or to evaluate teachers in new ways. On Thursday, Gov. Bill Ritter Jr. of Colorado signed a bill that would reward teachers who received strong evaluations and deny tenure to some who did poorly.
These education changes -- combined with increased spending on science research -- are meant to lift economic growth. Economists have long considered education and technology to be the main ingredients in growth. In Mr. Obama's phrasing, the goal is to create a "new foundation," more solid than the bubbles of recent years.
Even with those bubbles, the nation's economic output expanded only 20 percent from 2000 through 2009. In the 1980s, it grew 35 percent, and in the 1990s, it grew 37 percent.
Will this new progressive project succeed? There are any number of uncertainties: whether enough charter schools will succeed, whether the new health insurance markets will function well, whether the Fed will learn to become an effective regulator of Wall Street.
Some of those questions won't be resolved for years. But one issue should become clear much sooner. Mr. Reagan, Mr. Johnson and Franklin D. Roosevelt cemented their changes by retaining enough allies in Congress and serving more than four years in the White House. Mr. Obama has yet to do so.

Full text: Despite a chorus of voices claiming otherwise, we aren't Greece. We are, however, looking more and more like Japan.
For the past few months, much commentary on the economy -- some of it posing as reporting -- has had one central theme: policy makers are doing too much. Governments need to stop spending, we're told. Greece is held up as a cautionary tale, and every uptick in the interest rate on U.S. government bonds is treated as an indication that markets are turning on America over its deficits. Meanwhile, there are continual warnings that inflation is just around the corner, and that the Fed needs to pull back from its efforts to support the economy and get started on its "exit strategy," tightening credit by selling off assets and raising interest rates.
And what about near-record unemployment, with long-term unemployment worse than at any time since the 1930s? What about the fact that the employment gains of the past few months, although welcome, have, so far, brought back fewer than 500,000 of the more than 8 million jobs lost in the wake of the financial crisis? Hey, worrying about the unemployed is just so 2009.
But the truth is that policy makers aren't doing too much; they're doing too little. Recent data don't suggest that America is heading for a Greece-style collapse of investor confidence. Instead, they suggest that we may be heading for a Japan-style lost decade, trapped in a prolonged era of high unemployment and slow growth.
Let's talk first about those interest rates. On several occasions over the past year, we've been told, after some modest rise in rates, that the bond vigilantes had arrived, that America had better slash its deficit right away or else. Each time, rates soon slid back down. Most recently, in March, there was much ado about the interest rate on U.S. 10-year bonds, which had risen from 3.6 percent to almost 4 percent. "Debt fears send rates up" was the headline at The Wall Street Journal, although there wasn't actually any evidence that debt fears were responsible.
Since then, however, rates have retraced that rise and then some. As of Thursday, the 10-year rate was below 3.3 percent. I wish I could say that falling interest rates reflect a surge of optimism about U.S. federal finances. What they actually reflect, however, is a surge of pessimism about the prospects for economic recovery, pessimism that has sent investors fleeing out of anything that looks risky -- hence, the plunge in the stock market -- into the perceived safety of U.S. government debt.
What's behind this new pessimism? It partly reflects the troubles in Europe, which have less to do with government debt than you've heard; the real problem is that by creating the euro, Europe's leaders imposed a single currency on economies that weren't ready for such a move. But there are also warning signs at home, most recently Wednesday's report on consumer prices, which showed a key measure of inflation falling below 1 percent, bringing it to a 44-year low.
This isn't really surprising: you expect inflation to fall in the face of mass unemployment and excess capacity. But it is nonetheless really bad news. Low inflation, or worse yet deflation, tends to perpetuate an economic slump, because it encourages people to hoard cash rather than spend, which keeps the economy depressed, which leads to more deflation. That vicious circle isn't hypothetical: just ask the Japanese, who entered a deflationary trap in the 1990s and, despite occasional episodes of growth, still can't get out. And it could happen here.
So what we should really be asking right now isn't whether we're about to turn into Greece. We should, instead, be asking what we're doing to avoid turning Japanese. And the answer is, nothing.
It's not that nobody understands the risk. I strongly suspect that some officials at the Fed see the Japan parallels all too clearly and wish they could do more to support the economy. But in practice it's all they can do to contain the tightening impulses of their colleagues, who (like central bankers in the 1930s) remain desperately afraid of inflation despite the absence of any evidence of rising prices. I also suspect that Obama administration economists would very much like to see another stimulus plan. But they know that such a plan would have no chance of getting through a Congress that has been spooked by the deficit hawks.
In short, fear of imaginary threats has prevented any effective response to the real danger facing our economy.
Will the worst happen? Not necessarily. Maybe the economic measures already taken will end up doing the trick, jump-starting a self-sustaining recovery. Certainly, that's what we're all hoping. But hope is not a plan.

Abstract: In the last few weeks, as the bank has taken a central role in Europe's debt crisis, Mr. Trichet has reversed himself on buying sovereign bonds from weak euro zone countries; agreed to keep accepting Greek bonds, however downgraded, as loan collateral; and opened himself up to charges that he has weakened the bank's commitment to low inflation.

Full text: FRANKFURT -- For the first time in a long life of technocratic excellence, the president of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, finds both his judgment and his credibility in question.
The crisis of the euro and the panic of the markets have pushed Mr. Trichet, 67, who has run the bank since 2003, into bending the rules, compromising his principles and appearing to give way to political pressure from panicked national leaders. In doing so, he may have saved the euro but lost part of his reputation for probity.
"The E.C.B. lost its virginity," said Marko Skreb, a former governor of the central bank in Croatia. "The last couple of days have clearly indicated that we live in a new world."
In the last few weeks, as the bank has taken a central role in Europe's debt crisis, Mr. Trichet has reversed himself on buying sovereign bonds from weak euro zone countries; agreed to keep accepting Greek bonds, however downgraded, as loan collateral; and opened himself up to charges that he has weakened the bank's commitment to low inflation. He is being second-guessed from Athens to London and accused of badly misreading the markets.
During an interview in his office on the 35th floor of the bank headquarters here, Mr. Trichet, unfailingly courteous and urbane, showed no sign of being rattled by the criticism, though he was aware of it, and aware that his every word was parsed and second-guessed by a small army of analysts, economists and journalists.
"When you have the great honor to have enormous responsibility," he said, "you have to accept that all of your decisions can be criticized."
The euro's continuing problems -- and the bank's -- were evident again on Thursday, as markets in the United States, Europe and Asia continued to fall because of worries about whether the European debt crisis was really under control.
In the early hours of May 10, European leaders cobbled together a nearly $1 trillion deal meant to stun bond investors who, after Greece was driven to the brink of default, were hungrily eyeing attacks on Portugal and even Spain.
A few days before, on May 6, Mr. Trichet had told reporters that the bank was not even considering buying bonds from the weakest governments of the shaken euro zone. On May 7, markets tumbled.
But a few hours after the leaders adjourned -- at 3:15 a.m. on May 10, and by all accounts under severe pressure from President Nicolas Sarkozy of France and other European leaders -- Mr. Trichet and the bank board members reversed themselves.
Mr. Trichet's market-shaking change was controversial enough. But many analysts thought that he had badly misread the markets -- and Europe's politics -- in the first place, and that he and the bank, which controls the euro, were too far behind the curve.
In Germany, with its historic dread of inflation, the intervention in bond markets was met with something approaching outrage. One member of Parliament called on Mr. Trichet to resign.
Axel A. Weber, president of Germany's Bundesbank and a member of the European Central Bank's Governing Council, distanced himself from the bond purchases in a rare display of internal discord. It was particularly impolite, given Mr. Weber's ambition, supported by Chancellor Angela Merkel, to succeed Mr. Trichet after his term expires in 2011.
Jurgen von Hagen, an economist at the University of Bonn and seasoned central bank watcher, sounded almost betrayed by Mr. Trichet, who had made controlling inflation his watchword; as governor of the Bank of France in the 1990s, he made his name standing up to free-spending French politicians.
"I think he's been a good president, particularly throughout the financial crisis," Mr. von Hagen said before adding, "What we have seen in the last six weeks is terribly disappointing."
Mr. Trichet has plenty of supporters, even among the inflation-wary Germans. Joschka Fischer, a former foreign minister, came to Mr. Trichet's defense, praising him for acting intelligently in a crisis.
"We Germans, we love principles," he said. "Principles are fine, but in the moment of crisis even George W. Bush transformed himself into an American Lenin and nearly nationalized banking.
"When the house is on fire, you don't think of principles, but containing the fire. That's the situation we're in now."
Whatever the merits of the argument, one thing is clear to outsiders: Mr. Trichet's willingness to bend or break the rules and buy government bonds -- aimed at halting a potentially catastrophic sell-off -- served as final confirmation that the central bank had stepped once and for all beyond its narrow founding mission solely as a bulwark against inflation.
The European Central Bank now seems to have been pushed into the much larger role of guardian of financial stability in the 16 countries that belong to the euro area, with implications for all the 27 nations of the European Union.
The bank has crossed a Rubicon with the bond purchases, which some economists argue could spur inflation by increasing the money supply.
Mr. Trichet and the central bank's board members, who voted by telephone and not unanimously, denied any connection between the bond purchases and the nearly $1 trillion rescue package. But the decisions were less than two hours apart, and they had a reinforcing effect.
Mr. Trichet has often had combative relations with political leaders. In 2004, for example, he resisted pressure from Gerhard Schroder, then chancellor of Germany, to cut interest rates and loosen the European Union's limits on government debt.
Events have vindicated the bank's position then, Mr. Trichet said. The implication is that he expects events to vindicate the most recent decisions as well.
Still, the bank's abrupt shift over bonds struck even Mr. Trichet's admirers as disturbingly out of character. To some it seemed that the man who stood up to the former French president, Jacques Chirac, had bowed to pressure from European Union leaders, who had mismanaged their budgets for years and caused the crisis in the first place.
"Buying debt on the secondary market was a bad thing to do, and suddenly they do it," said Paul De Grauwe, an economist at the University of Leuven in Belgium. "It's very bad communication."
Mr. Trichet has said that the Governing Council was always aware that markets might turn their attention from Greece's dire public finances to other euro countries. But he couches the bank's recent actions in the language of the bank's anti-inflation mandate, rather than any attempt to serve as custodian of the European economy.
The nonconventional moves, he said, were necessary to "preserve the bank's ability to have an effective transmission mechanism of its monetary policy and to carry out its prime mandate of holding inflation below 2 percent."
"We have not changed our monetary policy stance," he said. He argued that the bank would take deposits to "sterilize," or offset, its purchase of sovereign bonds and thereby eliminate the inflationary effect.
While conceding that buying government bonds was new for the central bank, Mr. Trichet portrayed the move as consistent with other extraordinary steps the bank had taken since the global financial crisis began building in 2007.
In general, he and the bank have been praised for their actions in the first part of the financial crisis to keep banks lending, providing unlimited short-term loans at 1 percent interest to strapped banks and buying covered bonds -- low-risk paper issued by banks and tied to mortgages.
But with Greece nearing default and the whole euro project at risk, Mr. Trichet's defenders say that it would have been a much bigger mistake for him to stubbornly stick to his previous statements.
"Only dumb people never change their minds," said Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa, a former member of the bank's Governing Council. "It was a change of circumstances which required a different posture. It seems to me it's a dogmatic, if not pedantic, view of things to say that this entails a loss of credibility."
Mr. Trichet, an engineer and mathematician by training, graduated near the top of his class at the Ecole Nationale d'Administration, the elite and demanding school that shapes France's top civil servants.
Jean-Paul Huchon, a classmate, said of Mr. Trichet: "He is a man who lives in abstraction, who lives in numbers."
"He thinks that what is rational is automatically understood," added Mr. Huchon, who is now president of the regional council of the Ile-de-France, composed mostly of the Paris metropolitan area. That trait has left Mr. Trichet baffled by those who disagree with him on policy matters.
Yet Mr. Trichet, who is careful about revealing details of his personal life, is also a lover of poetry. Mr. Huchon said he had seen Mr. Trichet recite long passages of French poetry by heart -- an observation that Mr. Trichet confirmed by reciting several verses from "Cyrano de Bergerac."
Mr. Trichet shows another side of his personality, however, when discussing the misbehavior of Greece, which has long lied to its European colleagues about the real state of its economy.
"We share a destiny in common," Mr. Trichet said. "Now it's clear in the eyes of all public opinion and governments that this is very serious, and the fact that one particular country behaved very improperly has an impact on the full body, the full college. That is why proper surveillance by peers is so essential."
He called for stricter financial discipline, backed up by significant sanctions.
But as powerful as he is, Mr. Trichet needs the active support and initiative of national leaders to push the countries of the euro zone to impose the self-discipline needed to get through the crisis.
"The facts have proved him right," said Colette Neuville, a shareholder advocate who is a member of the European Commission's Corporate Governance Forum. But, she added, "You can't be right all alone. One has the impression that he's arrived at the limit of what he can do with the power he's been given."

Abstract: According to pension data collected by The New York Times from the city and state, about 3,700 retired public workers in New York are now getting pen-sions of more than $100,000 a year, exempt from state and local taxes.

Full text: In Yonkers, more than 100 retired police officers and firefighters are collecting pensions greater than their pay when they were working. One of the youngest, Hugo Tassone, retired at 44 with a base pay of about $74,000 a year. His pension is now $101,333 a year.
It's what the system promised, said Mr. Tassone, now 47, adding that he did nothing wrong by adding lots of overtime to his base pay shortly before retiring. "I don't understand how the working guy that held up their end of the bargain became the problem," he said.
Despite a pension investigation by the New York attorney general, an audit concluding that some police officers in the city broke overtime rules to increase their payouts and the mayor's statements that future pensions should be based on regular pay, not overtime, these practices persist in Yonkers.
The city has even arranged for its police to put in overtime as flagmen on Consolidated Edison construction sites. Though a company is paying the bill, the city is actually reporting the work as city overtime to the New York State pension fund, padding future payouts -- an arrangement at odds with the spirit of public employment, if not the law.
The Yonkers experience shows how errors, misunderstandings and wishful thinking are piling hidden new costs onto New York's public pension system every year, worsening the state's current fiscal crisis. And the problem is not just in New York. Public pension costs are ballooning everywhere, throwing budgets out of whack and raising the question of whether venerable state pension systems are viable.
In fact, the cost of public pensions has been systemically underestimated nationwide for more than two decades, say some analysts. By these estimates, state and local officials have promised $5 trillion worth of benefits while thinking they were committing taxpayers to roughly half that amount.
The use of public money for outsize retirement pay really stings when budgets don't balance, teachers are being laid off, furloughs are being planned and everything from poison-control centers to Alzheimer's day care is being cut, as is happening in New York.
According to pension data collected by The New York Times from the city and state, about 3,700 retired public workers in New York are now getting pen-sions of more than $100,000 a year, exempt from state and local taxes. The data belie official reports that the average state pension is a modest $18,000, or $38,000 for retired police officers and firefighters. (The average is low, in part, because it includes people who worked in government only part time, or just a few years, as well as surviving spouses getting partial benefits.)
Roughly one of every 250 retired public workers in New York is collecting a six-figure pension, and that group is expected to grow rapidly in coming years, based on the number of highly paid people in the pipeline.
Payouts for Decades
Some will receive the big pensions for decades. Thirteen New York City police officers recently retired at age 40 with pensions above $100,000 a year; nine did so in their 30s. The plan's public information officer said that the very young retirees had qualified for special disability pensions, which are 50 percent larger than ordinary police pensions. He said several dozen of the highest-paid New York City police retirees had disabilities related to 9/11 and the rest of the disabilities resulted from injuries in the line of duty.
In virtually every case, the officials who granted the rich pensions thought they were offering something affordable, because the cost estimates were too low.
Before Yonkers adopted a richer pension formula for police in 2000, for instance, it was told the maximum cost would be $1.3 million a year. But instead, the yearly cost is now $3.75 million and rising.
David Simpson, a spokesman for the mayor of Yonkers, said pension cost projections were "often lowballs," so the city could get stuck. "Once you give something, you can't take it away," he said.
Police pensions and overtime have been a sore point in Yonkers for many years and were the subject of an expose in The Journal News in Westchester in 2009. A special audit of police overtime in Yonkers in 2007 found that the police department had failed to enforce its own rules, creating pervasive opportunities for abuse.
Despite all the attention, police are now being paid as flagmen by Con Edison on their days off, Mr. Simpson confirmed, adding that the city was tacking the extra hours onto their pay, which is then reported to the state pension fund.
"The system encourages police to take as much overtime as they can in the last year before retirement. That's the way the system is structured," he said. "There's nothing illegal or unethical about this."
In fact, a Con Edison spokesman, Robert McGee, said a number of other towns also require the company to use their police officers as flagmen, raising its labor costs.
A spokesman for the New York State comptroller's office said that the city was in error and pointed to a 1986 decision by the Supreme Court of New York that found that hours worked by police for outside businesses could not be included in their state-paid pensions.
"It has long been established that such overtime from private special duty cannot be included," said the spokesman, Mark Johnson.
The question of how to pay for generous benefits is proving a challenge to New York and many other states whose revenue has fallen and whose debts have become harder to manage, while public officials try to limit the kind of deep service cuts that often mean political death. Some hard-pressed governments are belatedly coming to the grim conclusion that they have promised workers more than their sagging economies can deliver.
Outside the United States, Greece and Spain have recently reduced government pensions to deal with burdensome debt that has impeded their ability to finance themselves. The new British coalition government has said it will review public pension costs there as well.
Municipalities in this country cannot easily follow suit even as financial problems mount, though, because reducing benefits for their existing employees is considered impossible under the current laws of most states.
The New York State constitution bars public employers from slowing the rate at which workers build up their pensions over the course of their careers. That degree of protection contrasts sharply with the private sector, where companies can generally change the rate at which workers build their benefits at any time. Furthermore, as companies have reduced pensions substantially over the last two decades, states and cities have embellished theirs with sweeteners like inflation adjustments and lower retirement ages that appealed to unions and their members, who vote.
Police and other safety workers are in many cases allowed to retire with full pensions after 20 years. Other workers can often do so after 30 years, even as young as 55, although future hires in New York will have to work to age 62 to get their full benefits, under a law passed in January.
Census data from 2008 shows that the typical state or municipal pension is substantially richer than the typical company pension -- $15,941 versus $7,904 -- for retirees aged 65 and older. By tradition, public employees have said they accepted lower salaries in exchange for better benefits, but the Census data show this has not been true for a number of years. In 2008 the median pay for a worker in the private sector was $39,877, compared with $45,124 for a state or local employee. The data show broad national aggregates that do not try to compare similar occupations.
And, while companies must adhere to uniform federal guidelines about setting aside money to pay pensions, states do not. Some, like New Jersey, have failed to fund their pensions for years and have fallen so far behind they may never catch up again. New York City and New York State have been more diligent about contributing the required amounts each year -- but the required amounts now turn out to have been too low, in part because they counted on solid investment returns that have not materialized.
In Yonkers, contributions to the state pension fund keep rising. This year, to save money, the city is proposing to eliminate about 90 police jobs, out of 640. The savings, though, will not even cover the extra cost of the overtime-enriched pensions. Meanwhile, the police say the layoffs will make the situation worse, because shrinking the police force means those who remain must work even more overtime, driving up pension costs even more.
An online, searchable database compiled by The Times contains the names and pensions of about 3,700 public retirees in New York who receive more than $100,000 a year. Information was provided by New York State's two big pension plans, one for teachers and the other for other state and local workers outside New York City.
Four of New York City's five big pension funds also provided data. But the city police pension fund listed the six-figure amounts being collected by 536 retired police officers without giving their names. The pension plan for the city's firefighters has yet to provide the information, as required by public information law.
Even without names, the pension list from the New York City police plan shows a trend toward very youthful retirement, at a time when the city's contributions to the police pension fund have risen sharply.
New York City has budgeted a contribution of about $2 billion for this year -- about 64 percent of the police payroll, one of the highest pension contribution rates in the United States. That amount does not yet include money to make up for the investment losses of 2008, so the rate is almost sure to rise.
A Variety of Occupations
Not all the people getting six-figure pensions are former police and firefighters from cities with liberal overtime and disability policies. Hundreds more worked at hospitals, power utilities, port authorities and other "public benefit corporations" -- hybrid entities that compete with the private sector and pay their officials accordingly, but allow them, at the same time, to participate in the state pension fund.
Edward A. Stolzenberg makes a good example. He started out more than three decades ago in the Westchester County government; today, in retirement, he collects $222,143 a year, one of the biggest pensions paid by the New York State pension fund.
In between, he became county health commissioner, running the Westchester Medical Center when it was a big, struggling county hospital. The county made it a public benefit corporation in 1997, with a mandate to grow and compete with the big hospitals in New York City.
In the process Mr. Stolzenberg's salary shot up. By the time he retired, he was the highest-paid official in Westchester County, he said, with a salary of more than $400,000 a year. That was still less than the rate at a for-profit hospital, he said.
"In a time when the state budget is pretty bad and money is pouring out, people look at pensions and say, 'This is terrible! Why are people getting this kind of money?' " he acknowledged. "It may not be viable. But that's the way the state structured it."
He added that his successor at the medical center was making more than $900,000 and accruing a pension.
Companies that find they have overpromised have a way out. They can declare bankruptcy, and if a judge approves, they can send their pension plans to the federal agency that insures corporate pensions. That agency limits its coverage to what is considered a basic pension, currently $54,000 for a 65-year-old retiree, much less for younger people. If Yonkers could send its police plan to the federal guarantor, for instance, Mr. Tassone, at 47, would have his benefit cut from $101,333 to just $15,660.
But state plans don't have such an insurance program, much less any definition of a basic, guaranteed benefit.
Federal tax law does put a cap on pension payouts, currently $195,000 a year. Congress set this cap, which has risen with inflation, more than 30 years ago to keep employers from turning their pension funds into abusive tax shelters.
But New York State found a way around it. In 1997, lawmakers created a safe-harbor mechanism allowing retirees to collect bigger pensions legally -- a second pool of money called the Excess Benefit Fund. Towns all over the state pay the associated costs, even though only a few of them have retirees who qualify. At least 28 recipients in New York get pensions above $195,000 a year. One of the highest is George M. Philip, who gets $261,037 after retiring as chief executive and chief investment officer of the New York State teachers' pension fund. Since retiring, he has gone back to work as president of the State University of New York at Albany, drawing an additional $280,000 last year.
New York's attorney general, Andrew M. Cuomo, has said public pensions are getting out of hand, and has begun an investigation of places, like Yonkers, where there are unusual concentrations of six-figure retirees.
But he may well find that most recipients have done nothing illegal. The benefits have been enacted by legislators, signed into law by governors, hailed by comptrollers and adopted by local officials -- all of whom were told by actuaries and other financial advisers that the pensions would cost just a fraction of what they are now turning out to cost.
"In very few cases do they know what they're agreeing to," said Edmund J. McMahon, director of the Empire Center for New York State Policy, which tracks pension costs. "They almost always obscure the costs, from themselves and from the public."
Offended by Comments
Mr. Cuomo did not name Mr. Tassone but spoke of a Yonkers officer who had retired at 44 on $101,033 a year. Mr. Tassone said all his neighbors knew it was him, and he bristles at the implication that he got more than he was supposed to. He said he could correctly document all the overtime he worked, and that the practice was approved by the mayor and city council.
The special audit in Yonkers named Mr. Tassone in its sample of retirees with unusual overtime records, but did not accuse him of doing anything wrong. Disciplinary proceedings were brought against only one officer, who is now retired.
Mr. Tassone said the only reason he joined the police force was the promise of a full pension after just 20 years, and it would have been wrong for the state or city to go back on the promise after using it to recruit him.
He said he put up with hardships for 20 years as a police officer, "and now I'm at the end of it and I've become a target," he said. "I broke my hand three times. I broke my left ankle. I blew out my knee. In my last two years alone, I made between 350 and 400 arrests, and a lot of those people weren't volunteering."
Because he could retire young, he added, it was important to start out with the largest pension possible. In the coming years, inflation will eat away at his benefit. Public pensions in New York City and State have had a cost-of-living adjustment feature since 2000, but it applies only to the first $18,000.
"I concede, I have a very good pension, but what's that pension going to be worth when I'm 70 years old?" Mr. Tassone said.
Although limited to the first $18,000, the cost-of-living adjustment was the most expensive pension enhancement enacted in recent memory in New York, according to the Independent Budget Office. The cost has, once again, proved higher than expected.
Yonkers still offers full pensions to police after 20 years, but just in theory. For the moment, the city is too broke to send any new cadets to the police academy, and retirees are not being replaced.

Full text: Stocks on Wall Street declined on Wednesday as a German measure meant to thwart speculators in the European debt markets revived concerns about the debt crisis in Europe.
The Dow Jones industrial average finished about 67 points lower after earlier falling as much as 186 points, taking much of its direction from the value of the euro.
Europe's financial troubles have been buffeting equities worldwide for weeks, and on Wednesday overshadowed economic data that showed inflation well under control in the United States and strong earnings reports from discount retailers.
The euro fell to a new four-year low in early trading, but rebounded after speculation surfaced of intervention in the currency markets by the Swiss National Bank to shore up the value of the currency.
Nicolas Haymoz, a spokesman for the Swiss central bank, declined to comment on currency market developments. The bank has said in the past that it would act to prevent any excessive appreciation of the Swiss franc.
"There is a lot of speculation that there is a concerted effort to put a floor into the value of the euro," said Tom di Galoma, the United States head of fixed-income rates trading at Guggenheim Partners. But the decline in stocks reflected "a lack of confidence in the overall plan."
He added, "I think the longer-term view is that the euro goes lower."
The euro rose to $1.2387 from $1.2176 late Tuesday in New York.
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 66.58 points, or 0.63 percent, to 10,444.37. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was down 5.75 points, or 0.51 percent, at 1,115.05, and the Nasdaq was down 18.89 points, or 0.82 percent at 2,298.37.
The euro and stocks worldwide were driven lower by the ban imposed by the German financial regulations agency, BaFin, on naked short-selling in shares of 10 of the country's most important financial institutions.
The ban also applies to naked short-selling of euro zone government bonds and the use of uncovered credit-default swaps. The measure, which took effect Wednesday, will last through March 2011.
In a short sale, an investor sells borrowed shares, hoping to buy them back later at a lower price and profit from the difference. In a naked short sale, they sell without borrowing the shares first. Such bans were enacted at the height of the crisis in autumn 2008, but analysts said Germany's move suggested that the situation might be getting worse.
Nariman Behravesh, chief economist of IHS Global Insight, said the German ban and the prospect of other hasty financial regulations fed on the market mood.
"And the backdrop is the euro story, which today looks a little better," Mr. Behravesh said.
He added: "It is a mixed bag, and the markets are getting a little carried away with pessimism. Day to day it is a little hard to say what piece of news is going to influence market opinion. Today the mood is a little less downbeat. Less piling into gold, and less piling into dollars. It could change tomorrow."
In American economic news, the Labor Department said consumer prices fell in April for the first time since early last year, and inflation rose at its slowest rate since the 1960s.
The report suggested that the Federal Reserve has leeway to keep its benchmark interest rate low to help stimulate economic growth.
Two retailers, Target and BJ's Wholesale Club, posted increases in profit and sales in the first quarter.
The chief executive of Target, Gregg W. Steinhafel, said the results came in a "stronger-than-expected economic environment."
Stock in Target fell 19 cents, to $54.03 a share. Stock in BJ's rose $1.51, to $38.95 a share. Financial stocks were up, while industrial and energy stocks traded lower.
Caterpillar shares were down $1.75, to $61.44. Boeing was $1.51 lower, at $66.21. Citigroup was up 8 cents, at $3.81, and Bank of America was up 36 cents, at $16.31.
Major European stock indexes were all down about 3 percent.
Crude oil rose 46 cents, to $69.87 a barrel, and gold fell $31.40, to $1,193.75 an ounce.
The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 6/32, to 101 3/32. The yield rose to 3.37 percent from 3.35 percent late Tuesday.

Abstract: The unfolding of the debt crisis in Greece along with concerns about the economic recovery in Europe contributed to a stronger dollar, and that also exerted deflationary pressure in the United States, according to Gregory Daco, the United States economist for IHS Global Insight.

Full text: Consumer prices fell in April for the first time since early last year, and inflation rose at its slowest rate since the 1960s, a new government report said.
Consumer prices over all fell in April by 0.1 percent, the Labor Department said in its monthly report on Wednesday. The decline was the first since March 2009. Prices rose by 0.1 percent in March 2010.
The downturn was led by a decline in energy prices, especially for gasoline and natural gas, the report said. Energy prices fell by 1.4 percent in April, the department said.
Food prices rose 0.2 percent, mostly because of higher costs for meat, poultry, fish and eggs.
But without the volatile prices for food and energy, the core index for consumer prices remained flat, as they did in March. Over the 12-month period that ended in April, the core index rose 0.9 percent, which economists said was the lowest it has been since the 1960s.
Other costs that fell in that period included housing, down 0.7 percent, and apparel, down 0.9 percent, the largest decline of all the nonenergy components.
"I think what you are seeing is a continuation of a very soft trend," said Michael Feroli, chief United States economist at JPMorgan Economics. "And there is no evidence that it is about to turn around any time soon."
Altogether, the figures suggested that the government would be under no pressure to raise benchmark interest rates to curb inflation.
Joshua Shapiro, the chief United States economist for MFR, said that core inflation pressures remained "benign" and would remain so throughout the middle of next year, giving the Federal Reserve leeway to keep rates where they are.
The Consumer Price Index has increased 2.2 percent in the last year, and some costs have risen. The costs for fuel oil rose 2.3 percent in April. The price of medical care and used vehicles also rose.
The report suggested that government stimulus efforts had not spurred the undesired effect of inflation.
Subdued prices suggest that a more pressing concern could be deflation, which occurs when weak demand causes prices to fall. But whether deflation arises depends on the strength of the economic recovery and whether demand can remain strong even as government stimulus efforts expire.
"I don't think it's a major risk," Mr. Shapiro said. "I think that if the economy were weaker, then it would be a concern. But I think we have enough demand to keep things on an even keel."
Mr. Feroli said that if the economy continued to get closer to deflation, there was the risk that debt service burdens could go up. He said he thought that from the Federal Reserve's perspective, "the best inflation is between 1.5 and 2 percent, and you are below that and moving further down."
"I think if the economy continues to click along here we should escape any problems from this," Mr. Feroli said. "I think that is the baseline view. Hopefully demand continues to grow and that will keep prices supported."
The unfolding of the debt crisis in Greece along with concerns about the economic recovery in Europe contributed to a stronger dollar, and that also exerted deflationary pressure in the United States, according to Gregory Daco, the United States economist for IHS Global Insight.
"This month's low reading of the core inflation index is a clear indication that the Fed should continue to promote a very accommodative monetary policy stance," Mr. Daco said in a research note. "With no signs of inflation on the horizon, the Fed should continue to support the economic recovery by keeping rates exceptionally low for an extended period of time."

Full text: Ask a first grader to identify Bugs Bunny and the response more likely than not will be a blank stare. Dora, sure. Mickey, alive and kicking. But Porky who?
Worried that the low profile of the Looney Tunes cast of characters among children is the start of th-th-th-that's all folks for the historic cartoon franchise, Warner Brothers is embarking on a five-alarm rescue effort.
A new 26-episode half-hour series, "The Looney Tunes Show," is headed toward Cartoon Network in the fall and will star Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck as odd-couple roommates in a contemporary cul-de-sac. Yosemite Sam, Tweety Bird, Sylvester, Marvin the Martian and Porky Pig are their neighbors.
Meanwhile, Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote are going back to work in movie theaters in a series of 3-D shorts. The first of these shorts -- Warner has approved three, and three more are in development -- will play ahead of the movie "Cats & Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore," which arrives in theaters July 30.
The studio's consumer products and home entertainment divisions are trying to do their share, releasing a new Nintendo game featuring the Tasmanian Devil in September and several new DVD compilations.
An expansion is also under way at LooneyTunes.com.
"We talked at great length about whether we were audacious enough to take on such iconic treasures," said Peter Roth, president of Warner Brothers Television, who was recently given oversight of the franchise after a restructuring. "It's both costly and risky, but I think an extraordinary opportunity."
Warner declined to say how much it is spending on the initiative, but the television series alone carries a cost of about $750,000 an episode, according to industry estimates. "We want to reinvigorate the brand with the best possible execution -- high-quality, high-end state of the art," Mr. Roth said.
Improving the quality will not be difficult. "The bar had gone so low that we could only go up," said Sam Register, who took over as executive vice president of creative affairs at Warner Brothers Animation two years ago, referring to previous efforts to reimagine Looney Tunes for a new generation.
Warner has a reputation, both with fans and inside the industry, for ham-fisted campaigns to breathe new life into the franchise. Steven Spielberg sparked things up in the early 1990s with "Tiny Toons Adventures," a series in which new characters interacted with the originals. But a 2002 effort, "Baby Looney Tunes," was a dud for the former WB network and later for the Cartoon Network.
Big-screen resuscitation efforts have not fared much better. "Space Jam," a mix of animation and live action starring Michael Jordan, turned a profit back in 1996. But the most recent picture, the 2003 animation-live-action hybrid "Looney Tunes: Back in Action," left North American audiences holding their noses. The movie, with Brendan Fraser, cost an estimated $95 million and sold $25 million in tickets in North America, according to Box Office Mojo and adjusting for inflation.
More recently, big plans for an online Looney Tunes world fizzled amid the economic downturn. "The Loonatics Unleashed," another television series, was yet another sprucing-up effort from 2005 that introduced futuristic-looking, anime-influenced versions of Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck, was a wipeout. Many parents hated the Loonatics, which had mohawks and menacing eyes, and the series was canceled in 2007.
This revival, Mr. Register and Mr. Roth promise, will be different. One major shift involves the DNA of the wisecracking characters -- it's the same as what first made them stars in the 1940s. Bugs, Daffy, Porky and crew for the first time in years will look and behave in a manner that is familiar to adults who grew up on the cartoons. No babies. No punked-out space adventurers.
"We really like the voice and the tone of the show, and the look is just magnificent," said Stuart Snyder, who oversees Cartoon Network as chief operating officer of Turner Broadcasting's kids media division.
With the Road Runner, who never utters a sound other than the occasional "beep, beep," and Wile E. Coyote, Warner went directly back to the classic looks -- although they will be rendered with computers, an appearance that is now most familiar to children. The speaking characters were more difficult to update, but even they will hew closely to the hallmarks of the past.
"The minute you start drawing Bugs Bunny exactly as he was drawn in 1949, you expect the same animation and the voice to be exactly the same," Mr. Register said. "That's obviously not possible, so you pull the best stuff from the characters and do something slightly new with it."
He added that art from "The Loonatics Unleashed" is framed and hanging in Warner's animation offices as a reminder of what not to do.
The new series, still awaiting a premiere date, will be broken into bite-size components. There will be three six-minute stories that relate to one another, along with a two-minute "Merrie Melodies" component -- in which characters perform in music videos (one features Elmer Fudd singing a love ballad to a grilled cheese sandwich) -- and a two-minute Road Runner chase.
Despite misfires, the Looney Tunes brand is a still formidable part of Warner Brothers' consumer products business, especially overseas, where syndicated reruns of various incarnations still enjoy heavy play. Warner has tried to keep the brand alive in the United States in part by a healthy-eating partnership with Safeway and concerts nationwide called Bugs Bunny at the Symphony where orchestras play the music from classics like "The Rabbit of Seville."
Sales of Looney Tunes merchandise have been sliding for about eight years, but still ring up over $1 billion annually on a global basis via 1,000 licensees. (To compare, Winnie the Pooh generates about $5 billion annually for Disney.) The hope is that "The Looney Tunes Show," supported by the theatrical shorts, will fuel new product lines.
"We have to invest quite a bit of money in the content first," said Brad Globe, president of Warner Brothers Consumer Products. "Once there is new content out there, then retailers will become more interested in it."
Jerry Beck, an animation historian and the author of the coming "100 Greatest Looney Tunes Cartoons," said that fans would welcome another attempt to bring back the brand and that Warner, having hired top animation talent to work on the project, seems to be on the right track this time.
"Bugs is down but not out," Mr. Beck said. "It's very, very difficult to reweave older characters back into the culture, but I'm glad that Warner is at least not giving up on these guys."

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve indicated that it would wait until after it started raising interest rates before selling the huge store of assets that it acquired in response to the financial crisis. The goal would be to gradually complete the sales about five years after they begin.
While that strategy is not yet definitive, it is preferred by a majority within the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's policy-making arm, according to minutes released Wednesday from the committee's most recent meeting, on April 27 and 28.
But the minutes also revealed disagreements over when the sales should begin and how quickly the assets should be sold.
According to the minutes, a minority on the committee preferred announcing a schedule for asset sales, without necessarily waiting for the Fed to raise interest rates. A few wanted to start sales "relatively soon."
Most committee members seemed to think that the sales should start slowly, but increase gradually to let the markets adjust. But a few thought that the sales could be completed over three years, and that "a relatively brisk pace of sales" would reduce the risk of inflation expectations being set off.
For now, the committee did not make any decisions, agreeing that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which conducts the Fed's open market operations, should continue its current practice of rolling over Treasury securities as they mature and of allowing the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac debt to mature and the mortgage bonds to be prepaid over time.
If that practice were to continue without any change in policy, it could take decades for the Fed's balance sheet to return to normal.
The Fed more than doubled its balance sheet, to about $2.3 trillion, since the start of the crisis. It acquired mortgage-backed securities, debts owed to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and longer-term Treasury securities in an effort to hold down long-term interest rates. To buy those assets, it used its power to print money to create a large pool of bank reserves.
A foremost monetary policy concern at the Fed has been how to deal with the bloated balance sheet -- and the related question of how to drain reserves so that they are not available for banks to lend too quickly, which would expand the money supply.
The Fed has held the benchmark short-term interest rate near zero since December 2008, and has repeatedly said that the federal funds rate is expected to stay at that level for "an extended period." Inflation and inflation expectations have been low by historic standards as the United States continues to emerge from recession, with the unemployment rate near 10 percent.
The committee revised its quarterly, three-year forecast to reflect a greater degree of optimism about the economy than it had in January.
The committee expects real gross domestic product to grow 3.2 percent to 3.7 percent this year, up from 2.8 percent to 3.5 percent in January.
The group also lowered its projection for its most important measure of inflation -- the price index for personal consumption expenditures, excluding food and energy -- to 0.9 percent to 1.2 percent for this year, down from 1.1 percent to 1.7 percent in January.
The lowering of inflation expectations led some economists to predict that the Fed might wait even longer to start raising the benchmark fed funds rate, the rate at which banks lend to each other overnight.
"It is clear that U.S. rates will be on hold at near-zero for some considerable time, perhaps even until 2012," said Paul Dales, United States economist for Capital Economics.
The minutes did not suggest that the European debt crisis was a source of alarm for the committee members, though their views might have evolved in the three weeks since they met.
The minutes found that strengthening economic conditions in Asia had contributed to gains for American exports, but that "the escalation of fiscal strains in Greece and spreading concerns about other peripheral European countries" were weighing on financial conditions and confidence in the euro area.
"Some participants expressed concern that a crisis in Greece or in some other peripheral European countries could have an adverse effect on U.S. financial markets, which could also slow the recovery in this country," the minutes stated.

Abstract: Mr. Newport said that the multifamily housing construction market, which is part of the commercial real estate market, was being hit hard by high vacancy rates, low rental rates and difficulties getting financing.

Full text: Home building rose in April, government figures showed on Tuesday, as activity was possibly spurred by an $8,000 government tax credit for new buyers. But the data suggested that builders might also be slowing their future construction plans.
The Commerce Department said work started on 672,000 homes in April, up 5.8 percent from March. It was the highest number of housing starts since October 2008 and slightly ahead of analysts' expectations. It also showed a 40.9 percent gain compared with April 2009, when housing starts were 477,000.
Building of single-family homes also went up, rising 10.2 percent in April from March, the department said.
The end of the tax credit for first-time homebuyers, which had been extended from November through April for sales of houses that close by the end of June, might have had an effect on the numbers, economists said.
"There is little doubt the housing numbers have been boosted by the second expiration of the first-time home buyers credit," said Dan Greenhaus, the chief economic strategist for Miller Tabak & Company, in a research note.
The increase in building starts appears to show that builders were setting up for a busy spring, but a decline in the number of building permits issued indicates that some did not follow through, said Steven Ricchiuto, chief economist, Mizuho Securities USA.
Construction plans fell to their lowest levels so far this year, possibly from overbuilding. Permits for multifamily homes declined 11.5 percent in April, to 606,000 units, from a revised rate of 685,000 units in March, the figures showed.
Permits for single-family homes fell by 10.7 percent, to 484,000, from 542,000 in March. This is a significant number because it is not affected by seasonality and it gives an indication of future plans. Most of the permits were issued for construction in the South. Single-family permits were down in all four regions of the country.
"The builders overestimated," said Patrick Newport, an economist at IHS Global Insight. "They thought they would sell more because of the tax credit."
Mr. Newport said that the multifamily housing construction market, which is part of the commercial real estate market, was being hit hard by high vacancy rates, low rental rates and difficulties getting financing.
"Over all, I think it was a disappointing report," said Mr. Newport. "I was expecting stronger numbers. I thought that they were also being driven by other forces such as job growth."
The numbers are an important indicator of economic growth, because of the associated purchases of materials and hiring of labor.
Although the report suggests a recovery compared with last year, "home builders are not seeing a dramatic recovery in demand, but rather have seen only very modest progress from record low levels," said Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist for MFR Inc.
A separate report from the Labor Department showed that producer prices fell by 0.1 percent in April as food and energy costs declined.
Food prices fell by 0.2 percent, the first decline in nine months, and energy prices were down 0.8 percent.
The core producer price, which excludes food and energy, increased by 0.2 percent in April compared with March.
"It is still pretty tame," said Stuart Hoffman, chief economist at the PNC Financial Services Group in Pittsburgh.
Compared with a year earlier, prices were up 5.5 percent, and excluding food and energy, the rate was 1 percent higher.
"The message we are getting is inflation is a little further back in the pipeline," said Mr. Hoffman. "There is pretty much an absence of any inflationary pressures."
He said he expected the index to drop further this month as oil prices come down.
The data was not expected to have an impact on the government outlook for relatively low levels of inflation for the near future. The Federal Reserve has kept interest rates low to stimulate growth as the economy struggles to recover in the face of unemployment of nearly 10 percent.
Mr. Greenhaus said inflationary pressures were "quite benign."
"That is not to say nothing is going up in price," he wrote in a research note. "Just that inflation, as measured by the government, is nowhere to be seen."

Concerns Over Europe Flare Again, Pushing U.S. Shares Lower

Abstract: Art Hogan, the chief market analyst at Jefferies & Company, said new economic data and corporate results were mostly positive but could not counteract the euro's impact on equity markets.

Full text: Stocks on Wall Street fell on Tuesday and the euro retreated to a new low, in part after Germany moved to impose tighter regulation of financial markets.
Germany's Finance Ministry said it would ban naked short-selling in shares of 10 of its most important financial institutions. The ban, which would take effect early Wednesday, would also apply to credit-default swaps and euro government bonds.
Though a government ban on short-selling is not unprecedented, analysts said Germany's move raised questions that the crisis was getting worse, not better, and that European governments were being forced to take other measures on top of the sweeping rescue package.
"You are pointing a finger at speculators but not addressing the real problems," said Win Thin, a senior currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman & Company. "It is giving a sense to the market that policy makers are flailing. Greece is insolvent; that is what they should be concentrating on."
Short-selling allows traders to borrow shares and sell them, hoping to buy them back later at a cheaper price and profit from the difference. In a naked short sale, they sell without borrowing the shares first.
News of the ban emerged late in the day in Europe. Earlier, the euro had stabilized and helped to lift stocks, despite indications that the German economy might not be as strong as economists had thought. The euro later fell to 1.2176, its lowest level since April 2006.
"The short-selling news is causing another dislocation," said Tom di Galoma, the United States head of fixed-income rates trading for Guggenheim Partners. He added, "I think that is what has put the selling pressure back into the euro. The euro was having a pretty positive day until then."
The Dow Jones industrial average ended the day down 114.88 points, or 1.08 percent, to 10,510.95. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was off 16.14 points or 1.42 percent, at 1,120.80 and the Nasdaq composite index fell 36.97 points, or 1.57 percent, to 2,317.26.
All of the components in the Dow were down except Wal-Mart, which rose 98 cents, to $53.71, after it reported quarterly profits were up 10 percent.
Financial, materials, technology and consumer-goods sectors were among those that lost ground. Among the most actively traded stocks, Citigroup shares fell 13 cents, to $3.73, and Bank of America dropped 40 cents, to $15.95. Home Depot shares fell 86 cents, to $34.73.
Commodity prices also fell. Crude oil prices slipped 67 cents, to $69.41 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Gold was down $2.70 at $1,225.15 an ounce.
The Treasury's 10-year note rose 1 6/32, to 101 9/32. The yield fell to 3.35 percent, from 3.49 percent late Monday.
The FTSE 100 index in London was 0.9 percent higher at 5,307.34, and the DAX in Germany was up by 89.01 points, or 1.47 percent, at 6,155.93. The CAC 40 in France was up 73.77 points, or 2.08 percent, at 3,617.32.
Uncertainty in the United States market over Europe has been tempered in the last few weeks by economic data that points to an economic recovery, but the new housing and producer price figures released on Tuesday did not send a clear enough message to provide any momentum.
Art Hogan, the chief market analyst at Jefferies & Company, said new economic data and corporate results were mostly positive but could not counteract the euro's impact on equity markets. "The real negative catalyst is what is going on with the euro," Mr. Hogan said.
Housing numbers from the Commerce Department suggested that construction plans had slowed, and the producer price index suggested a benign picture for inflation.
"Inflation is not really moving one way or another at this point," said James O'Sullivan, chief economist for MF Global.

Full text: SHANGHAI -- After a spectacular rise last year, China's stock market has plummeted on what analysts say are growing concerns about Europe's debt crisis and expectations that Beijing is about to take strong action to slow the nation's booming economy and prevent it from overheating.
Investors are worried that Chinese exports to Europe will slow in the coming months and that government efforts to tame this country's economy by tightening credit will hamper a wide array of industries, including the nation's fast-growing real estate market.
Although share prices in Shanghai rose modestly Tuesday after falling 5 percent Monday, the Shanghai composite index remains near its lowest level in a year, down about 21 percent this year.
Stock prices have also fallen sharply over the last few months in Hong Kong and Shenzhen, largely because Beijing is expected to raise interest rates and tighten bank lending to help rein in inflation and soaring property prices.
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index is down about 9 percent this year.
China's economy has been red hot since late 2009, when Beijing's huge economic stimulus package began to kick in along with record lending by state-owned banks. In the first quarter of this year, China said its economy grew 11.9 percent.
The aggressive lending helped revive China's building boom and sent Chinese stock prices soaring. Last year, the Shanghai composite rose about 80 percent, making it the world's best-performing major stock market.
But now, with mixed signals about the prospects of a solid global recovery by the end of this year, analysts say Chinese investors have grown cautious.
"This doesn't really reflect what's happening in the economy now, but it reflects what investors think will happen in the future," said Zhao Xinge, an associate professor of finance at the China Europe International Business School in Shanghai. "The new policies could cool the real estate market. And the real estate market plays a major role in the economy -- not just steel and construction companies, even home appliances."
Although China's economy is still roaring, many economists expect growth to slow modestly in the latter part of this year, partly because of tighter monetary policies. And some warn of potentially bigger trouble ahead, particularly if exports to the United States and Europe -- China's two biggest markets -- are weak, and government stimulus money dries up.
Perhaps in anticipation, some investors are already pulling back from the stock market.
"This was a cash-driven rally, and now liquidity's being driven down a bit," said Stephen Green, a Shanghai-based economist at the Standard Chartered Bank.
Henry Cao, a professor of finance at the Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business, says some Chinese investors are already looking to invest overseas.
"They're hoping returns there might be better," Professor Cao said.
But other analysts caution that the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets are known for attracting speculators and, unlike the more stable Hang Seng index, are prone to volatile price swings.
In late 2007, the Shanghai composite soared as high as 6,036 before collapsing in 2008 and falling to about 1,717. Only late in 2009 did it start sprinting forward again. The Shenzhen index is down about 17 percent this year.
And yet, there is often a sense of optimism among investors in China, particularly in Shanghai, that any slowdown is just a breather before the next great stock rally.
That was evident Saturday, when this city unveiled a huge bronze sculpture of a charging bull and placed it in the Bund financial square. The sculpture is a replica of the one located in New York, on Wall Street. Both were produced by the Italian-American artist Arturo di Modica.
