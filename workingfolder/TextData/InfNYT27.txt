Full text:   Can a woman effectively run the Federal Reserve? That shouldn't even be a question. And Janet Yellen, the vice chairwoman of the Fed's Board of Governors, isn't just up to the job; by any objective standard, she's the best-qualified person in America to take over when Ben Bernanke steps down as chairman.
Yet there are not one but two sexist campaigns under way against Ms. Yellen. One is a whisper campaign whose sexism is implicit, while the other involves raw misogyny. And both campaigns manage to combine sexism with very bad economic analysis.
Let's start with the more extreme, open campaign. Last week, The New York Sun published an editorial attacking Ms. Yellen titled "The Female Dollar." The editorial took it for granted that the Fed has been following disastrously inflationary monetary policies for years, even though actual inflation is at a 50-year low. And it warned that things would get even worse if the dollar were to become merely "gender-backed." I am not making this up.
True, The Sun is a marginal publication, with strong gold-bug tendencies, and nobody would pay much attention if the rest of the right had ignored or distanced itself from that editorial. In fact, however, The Wall Street Journal immediately followed up with its own editorial along the same lines, in the course of which it approvingly quoted The Sun piece, female dollar and all.
The other campaign against Ms. Yellen has been subtler, involving repeated suggestions -- almost always off the record -- that she lacks the "gravitas" to lead the Fed. What does that mean? Well, suppose we were talking about a man with Ms. Yellen's credentials: distinguished academic work, leader of the Council of Economic Advisers, six years as president of the San Francisco Fed, a record of working effectively with colleagues at the Board of Governors. Would anyone suggest that a man with those credentials was somehow unqualified for office?
Sorry, but it's hard to escape the conclusion that gravitas, in this context, mainly means possessing a Y chromosome.
Both anti-Yellen campaigns, then, involve unmistakable sexism, and should be condemned for that reason. As it happens, however, both campaigns have another problem, too: They're based on bad economic analysis.
In the case of the "female dollar" types, the wrongheadedness of the economics is as raw and obvious as the sexism. The people shouting that the Fed is "debasing the dollar" have been warning of runaway inflation any day now for almost five years, and they have been wrong every step of the way. Worse, they have shown no willingness to admit having been wrong, let alone to revise their views in the face of experience. They are, in short, the last people in the world you should listen to when it comes to monetary policy.
The wrongheadedness of the gravitas crowd, like its sexism, is subtler. But to the extent that having gravitas means something other than being male, it means being what I like to call a Very Serious Person -- the kind of person who talks a lot about the need to make tough decisions, which somehow always involves demanding sacrifices on the part of ordinary families while treating the wealthy with kid gloves. And here's the thing: The Very Serious People have been almost as consistently wrong, although not as spectacularly, as the inflation hysterics.
This has been obviously true in the case of budget policy, where the Serious People hijacked the national conversation, shifting it away from job creation to deficits, on the grounds that we were facing an imminent fiscal crisis -- which somehow keeps not coming.
But it has also been true for monetary policy. The Wall Street Journal (news department, not editorial) recently surveyed the forecasting records of top policy makers at the Fed, whom it divided into "hawks" (officials who keep warning that the Fed is doing too much to fight unemployment) and "doves" (who warn that it's doing too little). It found that the doves made consistently better forecasts, with the best forecaster of all being the most prominent of the doves -- Janet Yellen.
The point is that while the gravitas types like to think of themselves as serious men (and I do mean men) who are willing to do what needs to be done, recent history suggests that they're actually men who are eager to prove their seriousness by doing what doesn't need to be done, at the public's expense.
Also, there was a time not along ago when almost everyone in the gravitas crowd, if asked who possessed that mystical quality in its purest form, would surely have answered "Alan Greenspan." How well did that turn out?
So is Janet Yellen the only possible candidate to be the next leader of the Fed? Of course not. But the case for someone else should be made on the merits -- and, so far, that hasn't been what's happening.

Abstract: Passage of the student loan bill came the same day that House Republican leaders were forced to abruptly pull from the floor a $44.1 billion spending bill on transportation and housing because of a lack of votes.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Something pretty rare happened in Congress on Wednesday: it approved and sent to President Obama a major piece of public policy by an overwhelming bipartisan margin.
The feat was even more notable because the legislation, which created a new set of rates for federal student loans, is entwined with many of the issues that often divide Republicans and Democrats: the economy, the financial markets and the government's role in lending. It passed by a vote of 392 to 31 in the House.
Representative Luke Messer, Republican of Indiana, praised the student loan deal as a triumph of both policy and politics.
"It's a great victory for taxpayers, because taxpayers won't be forced to subsidize student loan rates that are arbitrarily set by politicians," Mr. Messer said. "This, I hope, opens the door to potential compromises on some of the other big issues that we have before us that we have to deal with in the next several months. This proves Washington can work."
Despite such optimism, lawmakers had little choice but to find a path to a deal. Student loan rates doubled on July 1 because Congress could not come up with a plan to replace student lending laws that had expired.
Failing to act on a compromise before the end of this week would have left legislators heading home for a monthlong recess to face constituents already disillusioned over dysfunction and inaction in the Capitol. None wanted to face criticism that they were so inept that they could not protect middle-class families from paying double what they used to pay to borrow money for college.
Yet the vote, as encouraging as it was on the surface, raised the question of why Congress cannot find consensus on big issues more often. An overhaul of the nation's immigration laws, which passed the Senate in June, is stymied as House Republicans struggle to come up with a plan that unites the disparate views in their caucus. Though some believe that revamping the immigration system is crucial to the future of their party, others denounce any pathway to citizenship for the 11 million unauthorized immigrants in the country as amnesty.
Efforts to overhaul the tax code seem similarly stuck as Democrats demand more revenue, an idea that Republicans portray as unacceptable. And the parties have found even less common ground on the budget, as many conservatives insist that any new spending resolution not include financing for Mr. Obama's health care law.
"They don't trust each other," said Steve LaTourette, a former Republican congressman from Ohio and a close ally of Speaker John A. Boehner who decided to retire last year in large part because of his frustration with the dynamics on Capitol Hill. "Boehner doesn't trust the president. The president doesn't trust Boehner. And until they do trust each other, you're not going to see anything big getting done."
Passage of the student loan bill came the same day that House Republican leaders were forced to abruptly pull from the floor a $44.1 billion spending bill on transportation and housing because of a lack of votes. The bill had steep cuts that Republican moderates opposed. Community development block grants would have been cut in the coming fiscal year to $1.6 billion from $3.3 billion, a level lower than when the program began under President Gerald R. Ford.
Representative Hal Rogers, the Kentucky Republican who leads the Appropriations Committee, issued an unusual broadside after the bill was pulled, saying it was now clear that the House could not pass spending bills that complied with overall financing levels set in its own austere budget plan. That suggested tough times ahead for passing required spending bills, and some pointed out that even the student loan deal almost fell victim to the same fate that has doomed other big-ticket items in Congress.
"A few months ago, at least, it seemed like everybody expected a bill that connected student loan rates to Treasury rates would move ahead without any kind of trouble," said Neal P. McCluskey, an education analyst at the Cato Institute. "And it was surprising when there was."
The House passed a student loan plan in May. But Senate Democrats balked, saying that the borrowing rates it set were too high and would leave students and their families with too little protection from inflation and fluctuations in the financial markets. Then a coalition of liberal Democrats resisted any plan that linked rates to the financial markets, keeping a deal at bay for weeks.
Under the old federal student loan program, borrowers were offered a fixed rate. Under the new rate structure, which still drew opposition from nearly one-third of Senate Democrats when it passed last week, loans to undergraduates and graduate students, along with parents in the PLUS program, would be subject to a fixed rate plus the yield on the 10-year Treasury note.
Rates for loans taken out after July 1 of this year would be 3.9 percent for undergraduates, 5.4 percent for graduate students and 6.4 percent for those receiving PLUS loans. The rates are fixed over the life of the loan but would change for new borrowers each year.
In a compromise that pleased many Democrats who had initially been wary of using a rate that was subject to inflation and fluctuated with the markets, Congress set a cap on all loans: 8.25 percent for undergraduates, 9.5 for graduate students and 10.5 for PLUS recipients.
Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington, the chairwoman of the House Republican Conference, said that while she was "disappointed it took as long as it did for us to get to this place on student loans," she hoped that the legislation was a harbinger.
"I hope this is setting the stage for more bipartisanship and success on other issues," she said.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve issued a 700-word statement on Wednesday, but four words would have sufficed: see you in September.
As expected, the Fed's policy-making committee voted to press ahead for now with its campaign to increase job creation. And its statement said nothing about how much longer it would continue to add $85 billion a month to its holdings of mortgage-backed securities and Treasury securities. But the Fed left its economic outlook basically unchanged, suggesting that the central bank still intended to reduce the volume of its purchases later this year.
The statement, issued after a regular two-day meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, acknowledged the weak pace of growth during the first half of the year, which it described as "modest" rather than "moderate" -- the words are synonymous in English but distinct in the Fed's carefully calibrated lexicon, suggesting an even more lackluster economic performance. But it maintained the Fed's forecast that "economic growth will pick up from its recent pace" in the coming months, driving job creation.
The statement also repeated language first introduced after the Fed's previous meeting, in June, that "the committee sees the downside risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market as having diminished since the fall," when the Fed began this latest push aimed at increasing the pace of growth.
Analysts said they expected the committee to cut back at its next meeting in mid-September. Dean Maki, chief United States economist at Barclays Capital, said the statement was "on the dovish side" because of its references to slower growth, rising mortgage rates and low inflation. Nonetheless, he added, "We continue to expect the F.O.M.C. to taper the asset purchase program in September, provided that the next two employment reports are reasonably strong."
The committee had little time to grapple with the implications of the latest economic data. The government announced earlier Wednesday that the economy expanded at an annual rate of 1.7 percent in the second quarter, better than economists had expected but below the pace that Fed officials regard as necessary to create enough jobs to bring down the unemployment rate.
The Fed repeated its stark assessment that "fiscal policy is restraining economic growth." It also noted that "mortgage rates have risen somewhat," a new check on the economy that is at least partly of the Fed's own creation.
The average interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rose to 4.37 percent in July from 3.54 percent in May, according to a survey conducted by Freddie Mac. But that increase is only partly the result of investor uneasiness about the Fed's plans; it also reflects an improved economic outlook. And that improved outlook, in turn, is mitigating the impact of the rate increases.
David Hall, president of Shore Mortgage in Troy, Mich., said that the higher rates had cut into demand for refinancing, but that demand for mortgages to buy a home remained strong. "People understand the historical context, that these are still really low rates, and coupled with all the news about home values rising, there's still a lot of excitement about buying," he said. "That excitement has overshadowed the rate increases a little bit."
The Fed has also become more concerned about the sluggish pace of inflation. Prices rose at an annual pace of just 0.8 percent in the second quarter, according to the Fed's preferred measuring stick, a measure of inflation compiled by the Bureau of Economic Analysis -- well below the 2 percent annual pace that the Fed considers healthy. Low inflation can cause problems, although Mr. Bernanke recently noted that the reasons were "hard to explain to your uncle." The primary cause for concern is the risk that prices will begin to fall, which can plunge the economy into a debilitating cycle of deflation as prospective buyers wait for prices to fall even further.
James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, chided his fellow officials for underplaying this risk at the committee's June meeting. This time the Fed noted the risk in the statement but maintained its official view that the pace of price increases was likely to rise.
The statement was supported by 11 of the 12 members of the Federal Open Market Committee. The sole dissenter was Esther L. George, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, who has dissented at each meeting this year, citing the risks of financial destabilization and higher inflation.
The Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, surprised investors after the committee's June meeting by announcing that the Fed expected to reduce the volume of its monthly asset purchases later this year, and to end the purchases by the middle of next year, so long as economic growth met the Fed's expectations.
Interest rates rose in response, undermining the purpose of the bond-buying program, but Fed officials have not backed away from the timeline. They have been at pains to emphasize that they are not changing their goals. A reduction in purchases, they say, would reflect a judgment that the Fed has begun to achieve those goals. But at the same time, officials have said that if the economy requires more help, they would prefer to use other instruments.
Mr. Bernanke described this as "a change in the mix of tools" in testimony before the House Financial Services Committee earlier this month, suggesting that the Fed would prefer to extend its policy of holding short-term interest rates near zero rather than once again expanding its bond portfolio.
The shift appears to reflect a reassessment of the potential costs of asset purchases. A number of Fed officials have expressed concern that the bond buying could destabilize markets by, for example, reducing the supply of low-risk assets, distorting prices or encouraging speculation. Other economists, including Lawrence H. Summers, a leading candidate to succeed Mr. Bernanke, have expressed similar concerns about the purchases, which go under the label "quantitative easing."
At the same time, the Fed has faced persistent questions about the benefits of the purchases. Mr. Bernanke and his allies say the bond-buying, by reducing borrowing costs, has contributed to a recent rise in home and auto purchases. Other economists, however, regard its contribution as minor, at best.
Fed officials and supportive economists also have suggested that the central bank's asset purchases were valuable in convincing investors that the Fed was maintaining its long-term commitment to suppressing borrowing costs: so long as the Fed is buying bonds, it is not about to start raising rates. That belief has contributed to the buoyancy of the stock market. But this rationale, too, has its critics. James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, said that in his view the bond-buying was suppressing growth by treating the economy as if it required life support, which was undermining confidence.
"The Fed is perpetuating a crisis environment by remaining on crisis footing," Mr. Paulsen said. "It's time for them to end Q.E. and let the markets see that they can stand on their own."

Abstract: Optimists point to improved levels of job creation in recent months, a more robust housing sector and a surging stock market that has lifted the value of investment and retirement accounts for millions of consumers.

Full text:   The American economy managed to stay on track last quarter, defying fears of another spring swoon, but doubts remain as to whether it will finally gain the kind of sustained momentum that has proved so elusive since the recovery began four years ago.
The mixed picture facing the country was evident on Wednesday, as the Commerce Department reported that the economy, adjusted for inflation, expanded at a better-than-expected annual rate of 1.7 percent in the April-June quarter, even as inflation-adjusted growth in the first part of the year now appears slower than first thought. In a separate statement after a two-day meeting of policy makers at the Federal Reserve, the central bank said the economy was on a "modest" trajectory but gave no clue as to when it might start tapering back its huge stimulus efforts.
Like economists and traders, as well as the 12 million unemployed Americans looking for work, the Fed is struggling to gauge whether better growth does indeed lie ahead.
Optimists point to improved levels of job creation in recent months, a more robust housing sector and a surging stock market that has lifted the value of investment and retirement accounts for millions of consumers. Pessimists focus on the fact that the estimated economic growth rate of about 1.4 percent so far in 2013 is well below last year's levels of 2.8 percent, even as automatic cuts in federal spending and higher taxes continue to bite.
There were pockets of strength in Wednesday's data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, all of which will be subject to further revision as the Commerce Department gathers more information about the economy. For example, residential fixed investment increased by 13.4 percent, a sign that housing continues to rebound. Personal consumption rose 1.8 percent, as consumers showed some resiliency, especially given the increase in payroll taxes at the beginning of 2013.
Additionally, government experts have introduced the first comprehensive change in four years in how the economy is measured. They revised figures all the way back to 1929, while also restating more recent data to show that the 2007-9 recession was slightly milder than originally estimated and growth in 2012 was a bit better.
Still, economists emphasized that although the economy's performance in the second quarter was significantly stronger than had been feared -- Wall Street experts forecast growth would come in at just under 1 percent -- big challenges remain.
"The basic story of a deep recession followed by a lackluster recovery is essentially unchanged," said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS. Growth in the current quarter, which wraps up at the end of next month, remains a wild card, he added. IHS and other companies do expect a pickup in the second half of 2013, but more fallout from the fiscal tightening in Washington could still be felt, he cautioned.
"So far the effects have been fairly muted," Mr. Behravesh said. "We're puzzling over that."
Were it not for the federal cuts, growth would have been close to 2 percent in both the first and second quarters, said Steve Blitz, chief economist at ITG Investment Research. But that's about the best Americans can hope for, he said, at least in 2013.
"I don't see the economy breaking away from that 2 percent rate for now," Mr. Blitz said. He is more optimistic about 2014, when he said he thought the annual rate of growth could rise to about 3.5 percent. "The economy will have adjusted to the downshift in federal spending by then, and Europe won't be decelerating as rapidly, nor will China and Japan," he said.
The pace at which spending by the federal government is dropping stabilized last quarter. It fell by 1.5 percent, compared with an 8.4 percent decrease in the first quarter of 2013 and a 13.9 percent plunge in the final quarter of 2012.
More clues about the economy's performance will come on Friday, when the Labor Department reports on monthly job creation and the unemployment rate. Economists estimate the economy created 185,000 jobs in July, according to a Bloomberg survey, a bit below the 195,000 level in June, with the unemployment rate falling to 7.5 percent, from 7.6 percent.
In a separate report on Wednesday, Automatic Data Processing reported that private sector employers added 200,000 jobs in July, a bit above what analysts had expected. While the A.D.P. report does not always align with the broader figures released by the Labor Department, the figure was interpreted as another positive sign. A.D.P. also increased its original estimate of the number of private sector jobs added in June to 198,000, from 188,000.
One of the biggest economic puzzles this year is why job creation has been relatively healthy -- the economy added an average of 202,000 jobs a month in the first half of 2013, consistent with an economic expansion of 2.5 percent to 3 percent -- when the actual rate reported by the government was only half that.
One explanation is that the government has underestimated the true strength of the economy, and will revise it upward at some point in the future, much as the Bureau of Economic Analysis raised its estimate for growth in gross domestic product in 2012 to 2.8 percent, from 2.2 percent, on Wednesday.
The revisions also suggest that the recession, which lasted from the fourth quarter of 2007 to the second quarter of 2009, was slightly less damaging to overall output, even as the subsequent recovery was somewhat stronger. Based on the latest measures, inflation-adjusted output growth decreased at an annual rate of 2.9 percent during that time, instead of the previously reported 3.2 percent. The government frequently recalibrates its tools for measuring the economy. Wednesday signaled the first time the Bureau of Economic Analysis broke out a separate category for what it calls "intellectual property products," which covers research and development; entertainment, literary and artistic originals; and software.
Another possibility is that the uncertainty that held back job creation in the last few years has begun to fade, said Dean Maki, chief United States economist at Barclays. Shocks like the economic crisis in Europe as well as the federal debt standoff and credit downgrade in the United States have started to fade in the rearview mirror, he said, encouraging some employers to catch up in terms of hiring.
"Our models tell us that when uncertainty spikes, job growth slows relative to growth in G.D.P.," Mr. Maki said. "But uncertainty only delays activity, it doesn't destroy it. Employers gradually add jobs back over time, and we think that's what's going on."
DEBATE ON GROWTH: Two blog contributors -- Casey B. Mulligan, a professor at the University of Chicago, and Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities -- are in a vigorous debate that highlights some fundamental differences over the economy. Professor Mulligan, arguing that "high levels of consumer spending are a consequence of economic growth, not a cause of it," disputes Mr. Bernstein's assertion that inequality that weakens middle-class consumer spending can harm growth. In reply, Mr. Bernstein says that "when the economy is operating with excess slack," it is widely accepted that "Keynesian stimulus can lead to faster growth," much of it through consumer spending. nytimes.com/economix

Full text:   ABERDEEN, Scotland -- Peter Blake has an American employer, the oil giant Chevron, and his work is global. It is his job to pull together and dispatch billions of dollars' worth of sophisticated undersea equipment needed for oil and natural gas fields in the Gulf of Mexico and offshore from Angola, the Republic of Congo, Indonesia and Australia.
So why is Mr. Blake, head of Chevron's undersea unit, based here in northeast Scotland?
Because since the early 1970s, when oil was discovered in the British North Sea, Aberdeen has evolved from a fishing town, to an oil boom town, to the world's center of innovation and execution for the technology that makes the modern offshore energy industry possible.
"Scotland has been the home of subsea engineering," Mr. Blake, a Scot, said in a conference room in Chevron's European headquarters on a hilltop overlooking this city and its many dark granite buildings. "The expertise generated by the North Sea continually influences undersea work across the globe."
That expertise, with a resurgence of investment in natural gas and oil fields in and near the North Sea, means that Aberdeen, with 468,000 people in the city and surrounding area, has been able to nearly escape the economic doldrums that have plagued most of Britain and Europe. Aside from central London, Aberdeen is the wealthiest place in Britain, with an annual income of about £32,000, or about $49,000, per person. And thanks to the more than 100,000 jobs the oil industry generates in the area, unemployment in the city and neighboring shires is less than half the 7.8 percent national average.
The average pay for each of those oil jobs, at £64,000, is more than double the British average.
"We've got plenty of well-paid people," said Bob Keiller, chief of executive of Wood Group, a company that traces its roots to an early 20th-century fishing and boat repair business that has developed into a global oil services company with more than £7 billion a year in revenue.
Aberdeen does not look rich, though it does seem to have a disproportionate number of Range Rovers, Mercedes and BMWs. Its battered waterfront bars, with names like Neptune and Character, appear to have been little changed by four decades of an oil economy.
But the fishing boats have been replaced by big, brightly painted oil field vessels that pull in and out of the narrow harbor entrance day and night. Such is the demand for pier space that the harbor authorities are contemplating construction of an additional pier in the next bay.
Aberdeen remains a boomtown even though North Sea oil reserves are gradually being tapped out. And yet that is why the city has become such an innovation hub.
New development projects are having to venture ever deeper into more treacherous waters, whether west of the Shetland Islands in Britain or in the Barents Sea off Russia.
For two planned projects, Rosebank off the Shetlands and Alder in the North Sea, Chevron and its partners recently awarded contracts worth £550 million, or more than $840 million. In the case of Rosebank, equipment must work at depths of 3,600 feet, and its surface production vessel must withstand waves 98 feet high or more.
The companies winning those contracts included a joint venture of the oil services giant Schlumberger and Cameron International, an undersea hardware specialist; and Aker Solutions, a Norwegian maker of oil and gas equipment. Each has a big presence in Aberdeen.
As the rest of the global oil industry moves offshore and into deeper water off Brazil, Africa and the United States, the techniques and technology honed in the North Sea are increasingly in demand worldwide.
Oil installations in water thousands of feet deep often resemble jellyfish, with a single platform or vessel floating at the top and far below a mass of wellheads, underwater controls, pump stations, piping and processing units snaking along the seabed.
Humans cannot work under a mile of water, so installing such equipment calls for specialized ships that can lay pipes and direct robotic submarines that install and maintain the gear. The arsenal includes powerful pumps and "well trees" -- complex arrays of pipes and valves that sit atop undersea wells and regulate the flow of fluids.
"Acid stimulation systems" inject chemicals into seafloor wells to increase production. Gas compressors, huge pieces of equipment that keep gas fields pumping, are being built to go deep under water rather than on land or on platforms. All must be built to resist the corrosion of salt water and withstand tremendous water pressure.
The costs of undersea oil projects can run into billions of dollars because usually the only practical solution is to put most of the gear for a deepwater field on the seafloor, rather than on a platform or on land. Still, "the real estate on the bottom is cheap, compared to the surface," Mr. Blake said.
This urge to submerge is proving to be a boon for British purveyors of underwater equipment and services and for their Norwegian counterparts. Subsea UK, an Aberdeen-based trade group, figures that British companies have about £8.9 billion in revenue, or 45 percent of the global subsea business, which has been growing at an annual rate of 17 percent.
"We often try new technology in the North Sea. It is a test bed," said Matt Corbin, chief executive of the subsea unit of Aker Solutions, which employs 2,800 people here.
On a warm July afternoon in an industrial park near Aberdeen International Airport, Aker's engineers were at work on sophisticated electronic control systems for what may be a first: an enormous gas compression unit, 75 meters long. What looks like a railroad bridge will be installed on the sea bottom off western Norway at an oil field called Asgard that is operated by Statoil, the Norwegian national oil company.
At Schlumberger, the oil services company, drilling specialists in the Aberdeen technology center can monitor, by video, the progress of undersea drilling at its clients' projects anywhere in the world. "Because we run so much technology in the North Sea, we have the ability to look at data and give a sensible answer in other parts of the world, " said Graham Raeper, a Schlumberger engineer, as he pored over a readout with details of a well being drilled in Angola.
Aberdeen's ability to grow as an energy hub may have limits. Already, some industry executives worry that wage inflation could eventually prompt them to find less expensive locales. And as the region's offshore energy reserves eventually dwindle, many companies will have less reason to have Aberdeen addresses.
But some locals expect the city's intellectual capital to endure -- just as there is a Silicon Valley, though little of its business actually involves silicon. "We can be confident the exports will continue," said Alexander Kemp, an oil economist at the University of Aberdeen.
For now, at least, the job seekers continue to flock here, whether to the office parks or the oil field equipment factories springing up on what were cow pastures west of the city.
"We are in a bubble here," said John Morrison, a recent architecture graduate who is designing suburban tract housing to accommodate the inflow. "I'd struggle to have a job anywhere else."

Abstract: In a recent paper released by the National Bureau of Economic Research, Claude B. Erb and Campbell R. Harvey estimated that the value of gold makes up about 9 percent of the world's market capitalization of stocks, bonds and gold. Mr. Barro and Mr. Misra report that since 1975, the volatility of gold's return, as measured by standard deviation, has been about 50 percent greater than the volatility of stocks. Because gold is a small asset class with meager returns and high volatility, an investor may be tempted to avoid it altogether.

Full text:   "SHOULD gold be a part of my portfolio?"
A friend posed that question to me a few weeks ago, after watching gold's wild ride over the last few years. The price of gold was less than $500 an ounce in 2005, but soared to more than $1,800 in 2011, before falling back to about $1,300 recently. He wasn't sure what to make of it all.
My instinct was to say no. Like most economists I know, I am a pretty boring investor. I hold 60 percent stocks, 40 percent bonds, mostly in low-cost index funds. Whenever I see those TV commercials with some actor hawking gold coins, I roll my eyes. Hoarding gold seems akin to stocking up on canned beans and ammo as you wait for the apocalypse in your fallout shelter.
But I was also wary of imposing my gut instinct on my friend, who was looking for a more reasoned judgment. I knew that some investors saw gold as a key part of a portfolio. The author Harry Browne, the onetime Libertarian presidential candidate, recommended a permanent 25 percent allocation to gold. In 2012, the Federal Reserve reported that Richard Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, had more than $1 million of gold in his personal portfolio.
So, before answering my friend's question, I dived into the small academic literature on gold as a portfolio investment. Here is what I learned:
THERE ISN'T A LOT OF IT The World Gold Council estimates that all the gold ever mined amounts to 174,100 metric tons. If this supply were divided equally among the world's population, it would work out to less than one ounce a person.
Warren E. Buffett has a good way to illustrate how little gold there is. He has calculated that if all the gold in the world were made into a cube, its edge would be only 69 feet long. So the cube would fit comfortably within a baseball infield.
Despite its small size, that cube would have substantial value. In a recent paper released by the National Bureau of Economic Research, Claude B. Erb and Campbell R. Harvey estimated that the value of gold makes up about 9 percent of the world's market capitalization of stocks, bonds and gold. Much of the world's gold, however, is out of the hands of private investors. About half of it is in the form of jewelry, and an additional 20 percent is held by central banks. This means that if you were to hold the available market portfolio, your asset allocation to gold would be about 2 percent.
ITS REAL RETURN IS SMALL Over the long run, gold's price has outpaced overall prices as measured by the Consumer Price Index -- but not by much. In another recent N.B.E.R. paper, the economists Robert J. Barro and Sanjay P. Misra reported that from 1836 to 2011, gold earned an average annual inflation-adjusted return of 1.1 percent. By contrast, they estimated long-term returns to be 1.0 percent for Treasury bills, 2.9 percent for long-term bonds and 7.4 percent for stocks.
Mr. Erb and Mr. Harvey presented a novel way of gauging gold's return in the very long run: they compared what the Roman emperor Augustus paid his soldiers, measured in units of gold, to what we pay the military today.
They report remarkably little change over 2,000 years. The annual cost of one Roman legionary plus one Roman centurion was 40.9 ounces of gold. The annual cost of one United States Army private plus one Army captain has recently been 38.9 ounces of gold.
To be sure, military pay is a narrow measure, but this comparison offers some support for the view that, on average, gold should keep pace with wage inflation, which, thanks to productivity growth, runs slightly ahead of price inflation.
ITS PRICE IS HIGHLY VOLATILE Gold may offer an average return near that of Treasury bills, but its volatility is closer to that of the stock market.
That has been especially true since President Richard M. Nixon removed the last vestiges of the gold standard. Mr. Barro and Mr. Misra report that since 1975, the volatility of gold's return, as measured by standard deviation, has been about 50 percent greater than the volatility of stocks.
Because gold is a small asset class with meager returns and high volatility, an investor may be tempted to avoid it altogether. But not so fast. One last fact may turn the tables.
IT MARCHES TO A DIFFERENT BEAT An important element of an investment portfolio is diversification, and here is where gold really shines -- pun intended -- because its price is largely uncorrelated with stocks and bonds. Despite gold's volatility, adding a little to a standard portfolio can reduce its overall risk.
How far should an investor go? It's hard to say, because optimal portfolios are so sensitive to expected returns on alternative assets, and expected returns are hard to measure precisely, even with a century or two of data. It is therefore not surprising that financial analysts reach widely varying conclusions.
In the end, I abandoned my initial aversion to holding gold. A small sliver, such as the 2 percent weight in the world market portfolio, now makes sense to me as part of a long-term investment strategy. And with several gold bullion exchange-traded funds now available, investing in gold is easy and can be done at low cost.
I will continue, however, to pass on the canned beans and ammo.

Abstract: In a week when he tried to focus attention on the struggles of the middle class, President Obama said in an interview that he was worried that years of widening income inequality and the lingering effects of the financial crisis had frayed the country's social fabric and undermined Americans' belief in opportunity. Without a shift in Washington to encourage growth over "damaging" austerity, he added, not only would the middle class shrink, but in turn, contentious issues like trade, climate change and immigration could become harder to address.

Full text:   GALESBURG, Ill. -- In a week when he tried to focus attention on the struggles of the middle class, President Obama said in an interview that he was worried that years of widening income inequality and the lingering effects of the financial crisis had frayed the country's social fabric and undermined Americans' belief in opportunity.
Upward mobility, Mr. Obama said in a 40-minute interview with The New York Times, "was part and parcel of who we were as Americans."
"And that's what's been eroding over the last 20, 30 years, well before the financial crisis," he added.
"If we don't do anything, then growth will be slower than it should be. Unemployment will not go down as fast as it should. Income inequality will continue to rise," he said. "That's not a future that we should accept."
A few days after the acquittal in the Trayvon Martin case prompted him to speak about being a black man in America, Mr. Obama said the country's struggle over race would not be eased until the political process in Washington began addressing the fear of many people that financial stability is unattainable.
"Racial tensions won't get better; they may get worse, because people will feel as if they've got to compete with some other group to get scraps from a shrinking pot," Mr. Obama said. "If the economy is growing, everybody feels invested. Everybody feels as if we're rolling in the same direction."
Mr. Obama, who this fall will choose a new chairman of the Federal Reserve to share economic stewardship, expressed confidence that the trends could be reversed with the right policies.
The economy is "far stronger" than four years ago, he said, yet many people who write to him still do not feel secure about their future, even as their current situation recovers.
"That's what people sense," he said. "That's why people are anxious. That's why people are frustrated."
During much of the interview, Mr. Obama was philosophical about historical and economic forces that he said were tearing at communities across the country. He noted at one point that he has in the Oval Office a framed copy of the original program from the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom 50 years ago, when the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. gave his "I Have a Dream" speech.
He uses it, he said, to remind people "that was a march for jobs and justice; that there was a massive economic component to that. When you think about the coalition that brought about civil rights, it wasn't just folks who believed in racial equality. It was people who believed in working folks having a fair shot."
For decades after, Mr. Obama said, in places like Galesburg people "who wanted to find a job -- they could go get a job."
"They could go get it at the Maytag plant," he said. "They could go get it with the railroad. It might be hard work, it might be tough work, but they could buy a house with it."
Without a shift in Washington to encourage growth over "damaging" austerity, he added, not only would the middle class shrink, but in turn, contentious issues like trade, climate change and immigration could become harder to address.
Striking a feisty note at times, he vowed not to be cowed by his Republican adversaries in Congress and said he was willing to stretch the limits of his powers to change the direction of the debate in Washington.
"I will seize any opportunity I can find to work with Congress to strengthen the middle class, improve their prospects, improve their security," Mr. Obama said. But he added, "I'm not just going to sit back if the only message from some of these folks is no on everything, and sit around and twiddle my thumbs for the next 1,200 days."
Addressing for the first time one of his most anticipated decisions, Mr. Obama said he had narrowed his choice to succeed Ben S. Bernanke as chairman of the Federal Reserve to "some extraordinary candidates." With current fiscal policy measurably slowing the recovery, many in business and finance have looked to the Fed to continue its expansionary monetary policies to offset the drag.
Mr. Obama said he wanted someone who would not just work abstractly to keep inflation in check and ensure stability in the markets. "The idea is to promote those things in service of the lives of ordinary Americans getting better," he said. "I want a Fed chairman that can step back and look at that objectively and say, Let's make sure that we're growing the economy."
The leading Fed candidates are believed to be Lawrence H. Summers, Mr. Obama's former White House economic adviser and President Bill Clinton's Treasury secretary, and Janet Yellen, the current Fed vice chairwoman and another former Clinton official. The president said he would announce his choice "over the next several months."
More clearly than he did in three speeches on the economy last week -- the next is scheduled for Tuesday in Chattanooga, Tenn. -- Mr. Obama in the interview called for an end to the emphasis on budget austerity that Republicans ushered in when they captured control of the House in November 2010.
The priority, he said, should be spending for infrastructure, education, clean energy, science, research and other domestic initiatives of the sort he twice campaigned on.
"I want to make sure that all of us in Washington are investing as much time, as much energy, as much debate on how we grow the economy and grow the middle class as we've spent over the last two to three years arguing about how we reduce the deficits," Mr. Obama said. He called for a shift "away from what I think has been a damaging framework in Washington."
The president did not say what his legislative strategy would be. Even as he spoke, House Republicans were pushing measures in the opposite direction: to continue into the fiscal year that starts Oct. 1 the indiscriminate across-the-board spending reductions -- known as sequestration -- that Mr. Obama opposes, and to cut his priorities deeper still.
Republicans are also threatening to block an increase in the government's borrowing limit -- an action that must be taken by perhaps November to avoid financial crisis -- unless Congress withholds money for his health care law.
Mr. Obama all but dared Republicans to challenge his executive actions, including his decision three weeks ago to delay until 2015 the health care law's mandate that large employers provide insurance or pay fines. Republicans and some legal scholars questioned whether he had the legal authority to unilaterally change the law.
The delay in the employer mandate, which mostly affects large businesses that already insure workers but are worried about federal reporting requirements, was "the kind of routine modifications or tweaks to a large program that's starting off that in normal times in a normal political atmosphere would draw a yawn from everybody," Mr. Obama said.
"If Congress thinks that what I've done is inappropriate or wrong in some fashion, they're free to make that case," he said. "But there's not an action that I take that you don't have some folks in Congress who say that I'm usurping my authority. Some of those folks think I usurp my authority by having the gall to win the presidency."
The president's latest campaign for his agenda began as national polls last week showed a dip in his public support. The declines were even greater for Congress and Republicans in particular, in their already record-low ratings.
Mr. Obama said he would push ahead with a series of speeches that lay out his agenda ahead of the fights this fall with Congress. "If once a week I'm not talking about jobs, the economy, and the middle class," he said, "then all matter of distraction fills the void."

Abstract: Many low-paid workers feel their employers have put an invisible ceiling on their wages, with little prospect of ever making more than $10 or $11 an hour, as corporations have focused on keeping wages competitive and maximizing profits to benefit shareholders.

Full text:   OFTEN relegated to the background, America's low-wage workers have been making considerable noise lately by deploying an unusual weapon -- one-day strikes -- to make their message heard: they're sick and tired of earning just $8, $9, $10 an hour.
Their anger has been stoked by what they see as a glaring disconnect: their wages have flatlined, while median pay for chief executives at the nation's top corporations jumped 16 percent last year, averaging a princely $15.1 million, according to Equilar, an executive compensation analysis firm.
In recent weeks, workers from McDonald's, Taco Bell and other fast-food restaurants -- many of them part-time employees -- have staged one-day walkouts in New York, Chicago, Detroit and Seattle to protest their earnings, typically just $150 to $350 a week, often too little to support themselves and their families. More walkouts are expected at fast-food restaurants in seven cities on Monday. Earlier this month hundreds of low-wage employees working for federal contractors in Washington walked out and picketed along Pennsylvania Avenue to urge President Obama to press their employers to raise wages.
Ana Salvador, who earns $10 an hour after 10 years working at the McDonald's inside the National Air and Space Museum, wrote Mr. Obama to say that she did not earn enough to support her four children, adding that her family relied on food stamps and Medicaid. Another striker, Karla Quezada, who has worked at the Subway inside the Ronald Reagan Building for 11 years, said that while her employer made "lots of money off of my work, I still only make $9.50 an hour." This is higher than the $7.25-an-hour federal minimum wage as well as the District of Columbia's $8.25 minimum -- many states have minimums above the federal level -- but it isn't much after more than a decade on the job. In a speech in Galesburg, Ill., last Wednesday aimed at bolstering the middle class, Mr. Obama called for raising the minimum wage.
Many low-paid workers feel their employers have put an invisible ceiling on their wages, with little prospect of ever making more than $10 or $11 an hour, as corporations have focused on keeping wages competitive and maximizing profits to benefit shareholders. The richest Americans have benefited mightily from corporate America's record profits and the stock market's repeated highs.
"Long-term trends have not been kind to low-wage workers," said Lawrence F. Katz, an economics professor at Harvard University. "They've been hurt by technological change" -- scanners, for instance, have reduced the demand for supermarket cashiers -- "and by the decline in institutions like labor unions and the minimum wage," which has not kept up with inflation in recent decades. "Then on top of that is an extremely weak labor market."
The bottom 20 percent of American workers by income -- 28 million workers -- earn less than $9.89 an hour, according to the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal research group. That translates to $20,570 a year for a full-time employee. Their income fell 5 percent between 2006 and 2012. Wages for workers at the 50th percentile -- their median pay is $16.30 an hour -- have also dipped, falling 3.4 percent, while pay for the top 10 percent rose 3 percent.
Lorraine Riley James makes $9.35 an hour at the Macy's on North Michigan Avenue in Chicago and has received just $1.35 in raises since starting there six years ago. "I have so much experience that I don't feel what they're paying me is fair," she said. "I generated a quarter of a million in sales for them last year."
Jim Sluzewski, Macy's senior vice president for corporate communications, said, "We seek to pay competitive wages and benefits based on performance and experience," adding that the company has increased wages every year. "Remaining a stable employer requires that we remain a financially strong company," he said.
Corporate America has embraced many strategies to slice labor costs. Many Walmart stores -- as part of a new strategy to save on wages and benefits -- are hiring only temps to fill job openings. Scores of companies are relying increasingly on part-timers, who typically get paid several dollars less per hour than full-timers.
Caterpillar has pioneered two-tier wage systems, in which workers hired after a certain date are consigned to a significantly lower wage scale than others, and it recently pressed its longer-term employees into accepting a six-year wage freeze. Many Caterpillar workers ask why the company insisted on a pay freeze when it reported repeated record profits -- $5.7 billion last year, amounting to $45,000 per Caterpillar employee.
Caterpillar's chief executive, Douglas Oberhelman (whose compensation has increased more than 80 percent over the last two years), says the freeze was vital to keep wages competitive with rival companies. "I always try to communicate to our people that we can never make enough money," he recently told Bloomberg Businessweek. "We can never make enough profit."
Nick Hanauer, a Seattle-based entrepreneur whose company produces comforters and pillows, said: "Employers pay their work force as much as they are forced to and no more. There's no compelling reason to give raises" with the unemployment rate as high as it is. He said he supported a higher minimum wage so workers earn enough to live on. Mr. Katz sees only limited ways to end wage stagnation for low-paid workers. More education and training can lift pay for individual workers, but considering that 20 of America's 25 fastest-growing jobs -- like nursing home aide and retail clerk -- do not require a college education, low-wage jobs won't disappear anytime soon.
Mr. Katz said a good way to push up wages would be to reduce the jobless rate to 5 percent or less. That happened in the late 1990s -- the only time since the 1970s when wages for the bottom half of workers rose strongly. Employers had to bid up wages to attract workers or keep employees from jumping ship.
It remains unclear what the wave of one-day strikes is seeking to achieve. One objective is to push the issue of low-wage work onto the nation's political agenda. Some one-day strikers are calling for a $15-an-hour minimum wage, but Scott DeFife, executive vice president of the National Restaurant Association, scoffed at the idea, saying a $15 minimum would cause restaurants to hire fewer people. He said restaurants provide valuable experience for many entry-level workers, noting that "80 percent of restaurant owners and operators say they started out as hourly workers in the industry."
Some strategists behind the one-day strikes hope to create a political environment in which some cities might embrace measures similar to ones in Washington and Long Beach, Calif. Washington's City Council has approved a $12.50 minimum wage at big-box stores -- a move that has Walmart threatening to cancel plans to open three more stores in the city. And in Long Beach, labor unions persuaded residents to approve a $13-an-hour minimum wage for the city's hotel workers in a referendum last November.
Heidi Shierholz, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute, argues that wage increases would give a boost to the economy.
"The real reason businesses aren't hiring is they're not seeing consumer demand for their goods and services increase," she said. "We need greater demand for goods and services. It is clearly true that if people receive higher incomes, that will help the economy."

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- George W. Bush hopes historians will judge his presidency more kindly than his contemporaries have, but a transition coming later this year -- the departure of Chairman Ben S. Bernanke of the Federal Reserve after an eight-year tenure -- already casts a different light on the 43rd president's economic record.
Although President Obama has been Mr. Bernanke's partner in an effort to steer the economy through a financial crisis, deep recession and recovery, so was the man who put Mr. Bernanke in the job in the first place: Mr. Bush.
"Ben Bernanke, along with George Bush and Barack Obama, saved us from another Great Depression," said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, echoing the views of others in his party. "Twenty years from now, that's what history will say about all three of them."
That's the same Mr. Schumer who in 2008 ripped Mr. Bush's "disastrous course."
It is a reminder that the administrations of all presidents, sometimes unpredictably, have tails that extend long past their terms in office. And it provides some encouragement for Mr. Obama as he seeks to leave a mark on the 21st century economic debate -- even if he cannot fulfill his agenda before leaving office.
The catalog of Mr. Bush's economic sins has long been an article of faith among Democrats: tax cuts for the rich that turned budget surpluses into deficits, widening income inequality, slow wage growth, a hands-off approach to regulation that ended with the crash of the housing market and Wall Street. And not just among Democrats: Mr. Bush limped out of office with only about one-third of Americans approving of his performance.
But the momentary snapshot that political rhetoric encapsulates is only part of any president's story. Because of the Fed's vast influence over the economy -- rivaling or exceeding that of presidents -- selecting a chairman may be the single most consequential economic decision a chief executive can make.
On the day in 2005 that he appointed Mr. Bernanke, an academic expert on the Depression, Mr. Bush noted the Fed chairman's responsibility "for containing the risk that can arise in financial markets."
Today, few question Mr. Bernanke's success in helping contain the risks he confronted.
"On economic issues, Bush was not an ideologue," said Mr. Schumer, who in 2006 led Senate Democrats to recapture the majority and roadblock the Republican president's domestic agenda. "On his most important economic appointment, he showed who he was."
Henry Paulson, Mr. Bush's last Treasury secretary, praised Mr. Bernanke -- reappointed by Mr. Obama in 2009 -- for helping produce the "enormous accomplishment" of slow but steady economic growth for the last few years even as American consumers were "de-levering" themselves of debt. As the country nears the fifth anniversary of the financial crisis, Mr. Paulson said that Mr. Bush's critics ignored the reality that the underlying causes of the crisis were decades in the making. He said that Mr. Bush deserved more credit than he has received for Mr. Bernanke and for resisting the partisan and ideological polarization of Washington when the two stared into the economic abyss.
"It's a big part of his legacy," Mr. Paulson said.
Over conservative resistance, Mr. Bush backed the bailout mechanisms for Wall Street and the auto industry that Mr. Obama later would put into effect. "He put the political considerations aside and approved taking actions that he knew would be very unpopular with his base," Mr. Paulson said.
Still, there is no guarantee that Mr. Bush's appointment of Mr. Bernanke will burnish the former president's historical reputation, as veterans of President Jimmy Carter's administration can ruefully attest. The former domestic policy adviser Stuart E. Eizenstat recalls that Mr. Carter appointed Paul A. Volcker as chairman of the Fed in 1979, knowing full well that the interest rate increases he planned to tame inflation would harm Mr. Carter's re-election bid.
The Volcker Fed eventually succeeded in taming inflation -- during the presidency of Ronald Reagan, who had thrashed Mr. Carter in the 1980 election. "President Carter gets no credit for this," Mr. Eizenstat said.
Grading any administration's economic legacy is "extraordinarily difficult," said Claudia Goldin, an economic historian at Harvard. That's because of the elusive "counterfactual" of what another president might have done.
Similarly confounding is disentangling the economic results of a president's tenure from cyclical swings and long-term trends. The truest test, said Austan Goolsbee, the former chairman of Mr. Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, lies in the underlying economic forces a president manages to retard or accelerate.
Mr. Obama has three more years to shape an economic legacy beyond his management of the financial crisis and recovery. He is expected soon to appoint a new Fed chairman, aiming to match Mr. Bernanke's crisis-management skills and uphold the Fed's "dual mandate" to reduce unemployment as well as restrain inflation.
And in a series of economic speeches beginning this week, the president is trying to tilt the current stalemate between competing Democratic and Republican visions of the path to prosperity.
"Should we invest in middle-class people and their skills and count on that to drive the economy, or should we cut high-income taxes and regulations and count on that to do the driving?" Mr. Goolsbee said. "That's the religious conflict" the president seeks to influence.
Ms. Goldin, the economic historian, is skeptical. "I don't think presidents are very good at teaching the citizens of America EC 10," she said, referring to basic economics.
But Mr. Goolsbee sees hope in the success that Mr. Reagan achieved in imprinting calls for reduced government spending on the American brain -- even if spending rose during Mr. Reagan's term. In the same way, Mr. Obama might shape the thinking of a future president and Congress on the need to spend more on infrastructure, education and job training, even if he cannot convince lawmakers now.
"Realistically, it's obvious none of these things will pass this year," Mr. Schumer said. "He's laying the groundwork for the future. It's important to set the table."

Abstract: The labor and health measure -- for years the most contentious spending bill -- will protect some of the White House's priorities, like Head Start, special education and the National Institutes of Health, but to do so education grants for poor students will be cut by 16 percent and the Labor Department by 13 percent, according to House Republican aides.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Congressional Republicans are moving to gut many of President Obama's top priorities with the sharpest spending cuts in a generation and a new push to hold government financing hostage unless the president's signature health care law is stripped of money this fall.
As Mr. Obama prepares to deliver a major economic address on Wednesday in Illinois, Republicans in Washington are delivering blow after blow to programs he will promote as vital to a more robust economic recovery and a firmer economic future -- from spending on infrastructure and health care to beefing up regulatory agencies. While Mr. Obama would like to keep the economic conversation lofty, his adversaries in Congress are already fighting in the trenches.
On Tuesday, a House Appropriations subcommittee formally drafted legislation that would cut the Environmental Protection Agency's budget by 34 percent and eliminate his newly announced greenhouse gas regulations. The bill cuts financing for the national endowments for the arts and the humanities in half and the Fish and Wildlife Service by 27 percent.
For the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, Mr. Obama requested nearly $3 billion for renewable energy and energy efficiency programs -- a mainstay of his economic agenda since he was first elected. The House approved $826 million. Senate Democrats want to give $380 million to ARPA-E, an advanced research program for energy. The House allocated $70 million.
A House bill to finance labor and health programs, expected to be unveiled Wednesday, makes good on Republican threats to eliminate the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The labor and health measure -- for years the most contentious spending bill -- will protect some of the White House's priorities, like Head Start, special education and the National Institutes of Health, but to do so education grants for poor students will be cut by 16 percent and the Labor Department by 13 percent, according to House Republican aides.
"These are tough bills," acknowledged Representative Harold Rogers, the Kentucky Republican who leads the House Appropriations Committee. "His priorities are going nowhere."
The Democrat-controlled Senate will not go along with the House cuts, but the different approaches will complicate negotiations. With just 24 legislative days remaining before Oct. 1, talks to resolve the disparities have not really begun, lawmakers said, putting Congress and the president on a collision course that could shut down the government after this fiscal year ends Sept. 30.
"This is as serious a challenge on fiscal matters as I've ever seen," said Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the No. 2 House Democrat and a veteran of more than three decades in Congress.
In the Senate, Republicans are circulating a letter to Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, warning they will not approve any spending measure to keep the government operating after Sept. 30 if it devotes a penny to put in place Mr. Obama's health care law. Signers so far include the No. 2 and No. 3 Republican senators, John Cornyn of Texas and John Thune of South Dakota, as well as one of the party's rising stars, Marco Rubio of Florida.
The letter, drafted by Senators Mike Lee of Utah, Ted Cruz of Texas and Rand Paul of Kentucky, states: "If Democrats will not agree with Republicans that Obamacare must be repealed, perhaps they can at least agree with the president that the law cannot be implemented as written. If the administration will not enforce the law as written, then the American people should not be forced to fund it."
Taken together, efforts in both chambers amount to some of the most serious cuts to domestic spending since the Republicans in 1995 tried to shutter the departments of Energy, Education and Commerce -- and ended up shutting the government down for 28 days. "It's about time we cut some spending around here," said Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, chairman of the House Budget Committee.
A senior White House adviser, Dan Pfeiffer, said Republicans were offering no plan "other than indiscriminate cuts as far as the eye can see and repeal Obamacare as often as possible."
"We need them to step away from the brink, stop the gridlock and work with Democrats to make progress," Mr. Pfeiffer said. "If they don't, a train wreck is inevitable and the country will suffer."
If the White House can reach the coming fiscal year without economic disruption, the fight will transition immediately to the next showdown: raising the government's statutory borrowing authority. The Treasury has been shifting money within government accounts for weeks to keep the government solvent, but by October or early November, such "extraordinary measures" will have been exhausted, Treasury officials have told lawmakers.
Mr. Obama has said he will not negotiate terms to raise the debt ceiling, but Congressional Republicans say they will not let the deadline pass without concessions, either on changes to entitlement programs like Medicare or on some statutory timeline to put in place a sweeping overhaul of the tax code next year.
"We're not going to raise the debt ceiling without real cuts in spending," Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio said Tuesday. "It's as simple as that."
To resolve the brewing fiscal crisis, the House and Senate must first agree on a total spending number for the next fiscal year, then adjust their respective spending plans to comply with it. Republicans would have to drop their insistence that spending in fiscal 2014 be set at a level equal to the total fixed by the 2011 Budget Control Act, then cut further by the automatic, across-the-board spending cuts known as sequestration, something Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, said Tuesday that he will not do.
Democrats will almost certainly have to come down from the spending levels set in the spending bills being drafted in the Senate. And Mr. Obama, who has issued veto threats on every House spending bill, will have to give up on some of his priorities, Republicans say.
But beyond a few casual conversations on the Senate floor and between White House aides and Republican senators, no real negotiations have even begun.
Republicans are open about their intentions to target the president's priorities. The House transportation and housing bill for fiscal 2014 cuts from $3.3 billion to $1.7 billion the financing for Community Development Block Grants, which go mainly to large cities and urban counties for housing and social programs, largely for the poor. That level is below the number secured by President Gerald R. Ford when he created the program -- without adjusting for inflation.
The Securities and Exchange Commission, which has been flexing its muscle against hedge fund managers and insider trading schemes, would see financing cut 18 percent from the current level. Though Mr. Obama will finally get a fully operational National Labor Relations Board under a Senate agreement that forced Republicans to drop their filibuster of his three board nominees, House lawmakers are slashing spending on the board's operations.
Under other House legislation, the budget for the Internal Revenue Service would be cut by 24 percent, Amtrak would lose a third of its financing, and clean water grants from the Environmental Protection Agency would be slashed by 83 percent.

Full text:   SÃO PAULO, Brazil -- Shoppers here with a notion of what items cost abroad need to brace themselves when buying a Samsung Galaxy S4 phone: the same model that costs $615 in the United States is nearly double that in Brazil. An even bigger shock awaits parents needing a crib: the cheapest one at Tok & Stok costs over $440, more than six times the price of a similarly made item at Ikea in the United States.
For Brazilians seething with resentment over wasteful spending by the country's political elite, the high prices they must pay for just about everything -- a large cheese pizza can cost almost $30 -- only fuel their ire.
"People get angry because we know there are ways to get things cheaper; we see it elsewhere, so we know there must be something wrong here," said Luana Medeiros, 28, who works in the Education Ministry.
Brazil's street protests grew out of a popular campaign against bus fare increases. Residents of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro spend a much larger share of their salaries to ride the bus than residents of New York or Paris. Yet the price of transportation is just one example of the struggles that many Brazilians face in making ends meet, economists say.
Renting an apartment in coveted areas of Rio has become more expensive than in Oslo, the capital of oil-rich Norway. Before the protests, soaring prices for basic foods like tomatoes prompted parodies of President Dilma Rousseff and her economic advisers.
Inflation stands at about 6.4 percent, with many in the middle class complaining that they are bearing the brunt of price increases. Limiting the authorities' maneuvering room, the popular indignation is festering at a time when huge stimulus projects are failing to lift the economy from a slowdown, raising the specter of stagflation in Latin America's largest economy.
"Brazil is on the verge of recession now that the commodities boom is over," said Luciano Sobral, an economist and a partner in a São Paulo asset management firm who maintains an irreverent economics blog under the name the Drunkeynesian. "This is making it impossible to ignore the high prices which plague Brazilians, especially those who cannot easily afford to travel abroad for buying sprees where things are cheaper."
Brazil's sky-high costs can be attributed to an array of factors, including transportation bottlenecks that make it expensive to get products to consumers, protectionist policies that shield Brazilian manufacturers from competition and a legacy of consumers somewhat inured to relatively high inflation, which remains far below the 2,477 percent reached in 1993, before a drastic restructuring of the economy.
But economists say much of the blame for the stunningly high prices can be placed on a dysfunctional tax system that prioritizes consumption taxes, which are relatively easy to collect, over income taxes.
Alexandre Versignassi, a writer who specializes in deciphering Brazil's tax code, said companies were grappling with 88 federal, state and municipal taxes, a number of which are charged directly to consumers. Keeping accountants on their toes, the Brazilian authorities issue an estimated 46 new tax rules every day, he said.
Making matters worse for many poor and middle-class Brazilians, loopholes enable the rich to avoid taxation on much of their income; wealthy investors, for instance, can avoid taxes on dividend income, and partners in private companies are taxed at a much lower rate than many regular employees.
The result is that many products made in Brazil, like automobiles, cost much more here than in the far-flung countries that import them. One example is the Gol, a subcompact car produced by Volkswagen at a factory in the São Paulo metropolitan area. A four-door Gol with air-conditioning sells for about $16,100 here, including taxes. In Mexico, the equivalent model, made in Brazil but sold to Mexicans as the Nuevo Gol, costs thousands of dollars less.
The ability of many Brazilians to afford such cars reflects positive economic changes over the past decade, like the rise of millions of people from grinding poverty and a decline in unemployment, which is now at historically low levels. Salaries climbed during that time, with per-capita income now about $11,630, as measured by the World Bank, compared with $6,990 in neighboring Colombia. But Brazil finds itself far below developed nations like Canada, where the per-capita income is $50,970.
As a result, a resident of São Paulo, Brazil's financial capital, has to work an average of 106 hours to buy an iPhone, while someone in Brussels labors 54 hours to buy the same product, according to a global study of wages by the investment bank UBS. To buy a Big Mac, a resident here has to work 39 minutes, compared with 11 minutes for a resident of Chicago.
Stroll into any international airport in Brazil, and such imbalances are vividly on display, with thousands of residents packing into flights each day for shopping trips to countries where goods are substantially cheaper.
Even though the Brazilian currency, the real, has weakened against the dollar this year (it currently stands at about 2.20 to the dollar), Brazilians spent $2.2 billion abroad in May, the highest amount on record for the month since the central bank began tracking such data in 1969.
Eyeing this market, some travel agents have begun tailoring trips to Miami for clients eager to buy baby products like digital monitors, strollers, pacifiers, even Pampers wipes, which in Brazil cost almost three times as much as in the United States.
Seeking to prevent such shopping binges from getting out of control, the federal police screen travelers upon arrival, picking out people whose luggage appears to bulge with too many items. If it can be proved that Brazilians spent over a certain limit abroad, they are immediately forced to pay taxes on their purchases.
Such screening catches foreigners, too. In May, the police at São Paulo's international airport arrested two American Airlines flight attendants, both American citizens, on smuggling charges after they were found going through customs carrying a total of 14 smartphones, 4 tablet computers, 3 luxury watches and several video games. The smartphones were hidden in their underwear, the police said, and were intended to be sold on the black market.
Before the protests began, Brazil's government had begun trying to combat price increases. The central bank raised interest rates after an uproar over food prices this year contributed to inflation fears. The authorities removed some taxes on some products, like cars. Even so, inflation remains high while the economy remains sluggish, leaving many Brazilians fuming about the high taxes embedded in the price of products they buy.
A new federal law requiring retailers to detail on receipts how much tax customers are being charged has fed some of this anger. Fernando Bergamini, 38, a graphic designer, was stunned after spending $92 one recent day on groceries like tomatoes, beans and bananas, only to glance at his receipt and discover that $25 of that was in taxes.
"It is shocking given the services we receive for giving the government our money," Mr. Bergamini said. "Seeing it like this on a piece of paper makes me feel indignant."

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- President Obama says prosperity does not trickle down, and a rising tide does not necessarily lift all boats. The conservative policies predicated on those ideas, he maintains, amount to a you're-on-your-own economics, when the country really needs a we're-in-this-together approach: in short, prosperity needs to come from the "middle out" rather than the top down.
That is the catchphrase that the White House has settled on to signal both a diagnosis of the problems that have ailed the economy since long before the recession hit and the liberal policies that might act as an antidote.
Mr. Obama plans to elaborate on the middle-out theory in a series of speeches intended to move the national conversation from Washington's political dysfunction to the economic one on Main Street.
But the middle-out idea is also an intellectual counteroffensive against the supply-side economics that has dominated conservative thinking for decades -- and that were manifested in the tax and budget cuts that Mitt Romney put forward in his failed campaign last year.
The grand idea behind the rhetorical flourish -- which Mr. Obama has used for the past two years or so but which the White House put front and center this week -- is that the hollowing out of the American middle class is not just unfair or unfortunate, it has slowed growth and created a more fragile economy, too.
In that sense, the thinking goes, a thriving middle class is not just a worthy goal in itself, but a path to a stronger economy.
That is because the wealthy tend to spend less of their income on goods like cars, clothes and houses than the middle class, said Jared Bernstein, a former Obama administration economist. But in the past three decades, income has become more and more concentrated among the rich, he said, and that might have depressed the consumer spending that drives the American economy and slowed down the recovery.
"It makes this interesting macroeconomic linkage between the growth story and the inequality story, which has usually been discussed solely in terms of fairness," said Mr. Bernstein, who is now at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a Washington research group.
Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress, a Washington research group with close ties to the White House, said, "What we've learned in this recession is how much of a challenge the demand side has been."
"A big reason why we still have overly high unemployment is that we have a demand challenge," she added. "Wealthy people are doing really well, and we're still not getting high growth rates."
Middle-out economics is rooted in liberals' thinking dating back to the first Clinton campaign in 1992 at least. Mr. Obama himself put forward many of its ideas in a 2005 speech at Knox College in Illinois and in his book "The Audacity of Hope."
"Middle-out economics is not only an affirmative description of a set of ideas of where growth comes from in the economy, but an inherent criticism of conservative views of where growth comes from in the economy," Ms. Tanden said. But White House officials and many on the left said that two factors had recently crystallized the idea: rising inequality and the 2012 presidential campaign.
Since the late 1970s, the top 1 percent of earners has gained an increasingly large share of overall income. The recession interrupted that trend, but the rich have rebounded during the sluggish recovery while other Americans have struggled. The incomes of the 1 percent grew more than 11 percent between 2009 and 2011, but the incomes of the 99 percent actually shrank.
Even before the recession, middle-class families were struggling. Rapidly growing health costs ate away at paychecks, and technological change and economic globalization hit blue- and white-collar workers alike. The median household income, adjusted for inflation, has fallen about 9 percent since its peak in 1999, though the economy has expanded by about 23 percent.
Politicians left, right and center agree that the middle class is being squeezed. But the policies they have proposed to alleviate those pressures are sharply different -- and the conservatives' ideas have galvanized liberals.
Politicians -- including Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, the influential chairman of the House Budget Committee and Mr. Romney's running mate -- have argued that Washington needs to balance the budget, slash taxes, reduce regulations and get out of the way of American businesses and markets to benefit consumers and return the country to prosperity.
But Mr. Obama is again making the case that government need not get out of the way, but do more to help. Already, he has led the fight to raise taxes on the wealthiest Americans and has pushed through a health care bill that will extend insurance coverage to tens of millions of households. Other tax, education and social spending initiatives could do more to help, a White House official said.
The phrase "middle out" itself seems to have gained broad usage among liberals after the publication of the 2011 book "The Gardens of Democracy" by the entrepreneur Nick Hanauer and the writer Eric Liu.
Mr. Obama started using the phrase during his re-election campaign, and this summer the liberal journal Democracy is devoted to the "Middle-Out Moment."

Full text:   McDonald's on Monday dashed investor hopes that its business would strengthen in the second half of the year, blaming tougher competition in the United States and weaker sales in Europe.
The chain, the world's biggest by sales, reported a lower-than-expected profit for the second quarter and said it expected global same-restaurant sales in July to be relatively flat. Its shares closed down 2.7 percent at $97.58.
"Based on recent sales trends, our results for the remainder of the year are expected to remain challenged," Don Thompson, the chief executive, said in a statement.
Wall Street analysts had expected McDonald's business to improve in the middle of the year as food inflation and other pressures eased.
"I would have liked to have seen them be a little more positive on things," said Jack Russo, an analyst at Edward Jones.
Results for the quarter, which ended June 30, put pressure on Mr. Thompson, who was promoted to chief executive a year ago, when the chain was enjoying a multiyear run of rising sales and profits.
Still, Mr. Russo said Wall Street probably would give him more time, adding, "I don't see an operator in the United States or Europe really tearing it up."
In the quarter, global sales at McDonald's restaurants open at least 12 months rose 1 percent, in line with analysts' forecasts.
McDonald's said second-quarter same-restaurant sales in the United States increased 1 percent, missing the analysts' average forecast for a 1.5 percent increase.
The company is fighting to bolster sales as smaller American rivals like Wendy's and Burger King introduce attention-grabbing items, like bacon sundaes, and offer limited-time specialties.
McDonald's, which still dominates fast food, has offered late-night breakfasts, adjusted other menus and advertised value-priced meals to increase traffic.
The chain, based in Oak Brook, Ill., said its new line of Quarter Pounders had sold well. It recently dropped lackluster sellers like premium Angus burgers, while catching up with rivals by introducing an egg-white version of its breakfast sandwich.
Second-quarter profit rose 3.7 percent to $1.4 billion, but earnings per share, $1.38, missed analysts' estimate by 2 cents, according to Thomson Reuters.

Full text:   IF you'd like to know where American political debates are headed, the data suggest a simple answer. The next major struggle -- in economic terms at least -- will be over whether taxes on personal wealth should rise -- and by how much.
The mathematical reality is that wealth is becoming more important, relative to income. In a new paper, "Capital Is Back: Wealth-Income Ratios in Rich Countries 1700-2010," Professors Thomas Piketty and Gabriel Zucman of the Paris School of Economics have performed the heroic task of measuring wealth for eight leading economies: the United States, Canada, Britain, France, Italy, Germany, Japan and Australia.
Their estimates reveal some striking trends. For instance, wealth accumulation in these eight countries has risen relative to yearly production. Wealth-to-income ratios in these nations climbed from a range of 200 to 300 percent in 1970 to a range of 400 to 600 percent in 2010. Behind the changing ratios is some bad news, namely that slow productivity growth and slow population growth have depressed income growth, but also some good news -- that relative peace and capital gains have preserved wealth.
Focusing on the wealth of economies lets us reframe our recent debates about government debt in useful ways. A look at the ratio of debt to gross national product, for example, can be scary, but the ratio of debt to wealth is far less forbidding. If, say, a nation's debt-to-G.D.P. ratio is 100 percent -- often considered a dangerous level -- and national wealth is 10 times yearly national income, the debt-to-wealth ratio is thus 10 percent, which is comparable to owing $100,000 on a $1 million home. Not so scary.
Using the wealth numbers provided by Professors Piketty and Zucman, we can understand how Japan, despite a debt-to-G.D.P. ratio of more than 200 percent, can maintain low interest rates; Japan has a wealth-to-income ratio of about 600 percent. In essence, creditors think the Japanese political system will be able to drum up enough support for the requisite taxes, pulled out of national wealth if necessary, when the time comes.
But don't relax too quickly, because fiscal problems remain very real for many countries. While virtually every government could pay off its debts by taxing wealth, such taxes are often politically unacceptable. In other words, fiscal problems are best regarded as problems of dysfunctional governance. In the recent elections in Italy, the incumbent government lost voter support partly because it addressed the nation's revenue problems by levying a wealth tax on real estate; the policy remains contentious and may yet be repealed or limited.
And here is a related issue: If there is enough national wealth to pay off debts, it may be harder to arrange bailouts from outside.
In the European Union, countries like Germany may regard the union's more troubled nations as shirking their fiscal duties, and that makes cooperation harder to achieve. Italy, for instance, is in a fiscal crisis, but it also has an especially high wealth-to-income ratio, at 650 percent, indicating that it could pay off its debt if more of that wealth were taxed. Germany, by contrast, has a much lower wealth-to-income ratio: 400 percent. And though the professors caution that the German data, in particular, may be incomplete, the figures do lend support or at least plausibility to the recent argument that Germany shouldn't be viewed as the rich uncle of Europe.
Some forms of wealth taxation take hidden forms, such as financial repression. This occurs when a nation's citizens are required to hold deposits in banks under unfavorable terms -- meaning at low interest rates. The banks, in turn, may be required to buy government debt to help finance a budget deficit. For better or worse, this is likely part of a longer-run resolution of fiscal problems in the periphery of the euro zone.
In the United States, wealth taxes are currently limited to a few levies, such as property taxes and inheritance taxes. Capital gains taxes that aren't indexed to inflation also serve as an implicit wealth tax, because they dig into the body of a person's capital. Most likely those rates will rise. Like the bank robber Willie Sutton, revenue-hungry governments go "where the money is."
The coming battles over wealth taxation may prove especially bitter and polarizing. Most wealth has already been subjected to income and other taxes, perhaps multiple times. It doesn't seem fair to the holders of that wealth to suddenly pay additional taxes on assets that they thought were in the clear, and such taxes would signal that previous policy has failed.
Higher wealth in a nation means that there is more to take, and growing inequality means there are more problems that its government might seek to remedy. At the same time, however, this new economic configuration will mean greater political influence for the holders of that wealth, and that will make higher wealth taxes harder to achieve.
Historically, economists -- including me -- have generally favored taxes on consumption, on the grounds that they would do the least damage to long-term savings, investment and economic growth. Yet in some eyes, rising wealth will become a tempting target for short-term political gain. And note that while most Republicans currently oppose consumption taxes, they may dislike the relevant alternative, namely wealth taxes, even more.
Get ready to choose a side.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Chairman Ben S. Bernanke of the Federal Reserve said on Thursday that it was "way too early to make any judgment" about a potential decision to start cutting back on the central bank's asset purchases in September.
Mr. Bernanke, appearing before the Senate one day after he testified before the House, largely repeated the themes and often the words of Wednesday's testimony.
He said that the Fed had not slackened in its commitment to stimulate the economy -- it will cut back only if the economy is making progress. He chastised Congress, saying it was impeding economic growth. And he demurred from talking about his own future, choosing instead to listen quietly as senator after senator treated the hearing like a goodbye party.
This may have been Mr. Bernanke's final appearance before Congress as Fed chairman. It is widely expected that he will step down in January.
His last decision is when the Fed should begin to reduce its stimulus efforts. The Fed is buying $85 billion a month in Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities.
Mr. Bernanke said on Thursday that the Fed had concluded that such purchases, aimed at reducing long-term interest rates, do less to bolster the economy than the Fed's traditional focus on reducing short-term rates. He also suggested that in announcing a timeline for tapering last month, the Fed had succeeded in tempering risk-taking in financial markets.
But he once again resisted the idea that the Fed was lowering its sights.
"Isn't it still way too soon to consider any kind of policy tightening?" Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey asked Mr. Bernanke, citing the persistently high level of unemployment and the absence of inflationary pressures.
Mr. Bernanke responded that the Fed was changing its approach, not its goals. In testimony, he underscored that the central bank had other tools at its disposal, besides asset purchases.
"I think that we will be able to maintain that high level of accommodation ultimately through rate policy and, you know -- and by holding a very large balance sheet," he said.
Some economists, including Adam S. Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, argue that the Fed is making the wrong choice. Mr. Posen describes the Fed's statements about its plans to hold down interest rates as "cheap talk," and says it should continue with bond-buying instead.
A further complication for the Fed is that Mr. Bernanke's likely departure is beginning to erode his credibility as a spokesman about the Fed's future plans.
Mr. Bernanke has said that the Fed expects to reduce its bond-buying later this year, and to end purchases by the middle of next year, as long as economic growth remains "broadly" in line with the Fed's expectations.
"We have given some fairly specific qualitative guidance about what we're looking for," he said Thursday. Specifically, the Fed wants the unemployment rate to decline from the current rate of 7.6 percent to a rate "in the general vicinity of 7 percent with inflation moving back toward this 2 percent objective."
The Fed, however, has not included that guidance in its policy statements. And an account of the most recent meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee noted that "about half" of the 19 officials who participated said before the meeting that they expected to end asset purchases by the end of this year.
Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, asked Mr. Bernanke about the apparent disagreement over the question of how much longer the Fed should continue its current bond-buying campaign.
"There seems to be some disparity between the other members and you, and if you're not there come next year, there's a worry there," Mr. Schumer said. "Do they think unemployment will be 7 percent this year, or do they have different assessments about the relative cost and benefit of" quantitative easing?
Mr. Bernanke responded that officials had various reasons for their views. Some regard asset purchases as ineffective, while others may be more optimistic about the economy. But he added that the committee had "a very careful discussion" that led to his public statement about the probable timetable for tapering.
"The general scenario which I described in my press conference is broadly supported by people on the committee and including both voters and nonvoters," he said.

Full text:   It is amazing that a lot of criticism of the Federal Reserve today focuses on what it clearly got right -- the response to the debt crisis in 2008 and thereafter, a response that may well have prevented Great Depression II -- and not on what it got wrong: policies that allowed the dangerous imbalances to grow and bring on the crisis.
You could see that this week when Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, made his semiannual pilgrimage to Capitol Hill to discuss the state of the economy. Lawmakers voiced concern about possibly excessive regulation of banks, but not about the clearly inadequate capital the big banks -- and many small ones -- had before the crisis.
Some of them seemed to be upset that the Fed's policies had caused stock prices to rise. Jeb Hensarling, the Texas Republican who is chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, seemed to think that all current economic problems could be traced to President Obama's excessive spending.
He was upset that the "Federal Reserve has regrettably, in many ways, enabled this failed economic policy through a program of risky and unprecedented asset purchases."
Mr. Bernanke, who is probably nearing the end of his tenure running the Fed, seemed to have had such criticisms in mind last week when he assessed "the first 100 years of the Federal Reserve" at a conference in Cambridge, Mass.
In analyzing the Fed's failures during the Depression, he seemed to be taking clear aim at some of his current critics -- and perhaps at other central banks that were far less aggressive after the credit crisis.
First, he appeared to address the idea, popular in some circles, that we need a new gold standard.
"The degree to which the gold standard actually constrained U.S. monetary policy during the early 1930s is debated," he said, "but the gold standard philosophy clearly did not encourage the sort of highly expansionary policies that were needed." He said policy makers, following flawed economic theories, concluded "on the basis of low nominal interest rates and low borrowings from the Fed that monetary policy was appropriately supportive and that further actions would be fruitless."
Was that a criticism of the European Central Bank under Jean-Claude Trichet, which lowered interest rates but did little else as the euro zone crisis grew? It certainly helped to explain why Mr. Bernanke felt the need to embark on quantitative easing and to focus on longer-term interest rates as well as short-term ones.
Then Mr. Bernanke pointed to "another counterproductive doctrine: the so-called liquidationist view, that depressions perform a necessary cleansing function." That was the view pushed in the early 1930s by Andrew Mellon, the Treasury secretary, to such an extent that it angered even President Herbert Hoover, who did not, however, seem to think he could overrule the secretary. Now the comments could be read as a reproach to those, in the United States and Europe, who push for austerity above all else.
"It may be that the Federal Reserve suffered less from lack of leadership in the 1930s than from the lack of an intellectual framework for understanding what was happening and what needed to be done," Mr. Bernanke concluded.
It seems to me that something similar could be said for the Fed before the debt crisis erupted. The intellectual framework it used simply could not cope with the idea that financial stability can itself become a destabilizing factor, as investors and bankers conclude that it is safe to take on more and more risk.
For a time, the period before the collapse was known as the "Great Moderation," a term that Mr. Bernanke helped to publicize in a 2004 speech. Low levels of inflation, long periods of economic growth and low levels of employment volatility were viewed as unquestioned proof of success.
And what brought on that success? In 2004, Mr. Bernanke, then a Fed governor, conceded good luck might have helped, but his view was that "improvements in monetary policy, though certainly not the only factor, have probably been an important source of the Great Moderation."
In 2005, three Fed economists, Karen E. Dynan, Douglas W. Elmendorf and Daniel E. Sichel, proposed an additional explanation for the Great Moderation: the success of financial innovation.
"Improved assessment and pricing of risk, expanded lending to households without strong collateral, more widespread securitization of loans, and the development of markets for riskier corporate debt have enhanced the ability of households and businesses to borrow funds," they wrote. "Greater use of credit could foster a reduction in economic volatility by lessening the sensitivity of household and business spending to downturns in income and cash flow."
At least Mr. Bernanke's hubris was not as great as that of Robert E. Lucas Jr., the Nobel Prize-winning University of Chicago economist. In 2003, he began his presidential address to the American Economic Association by proclaiming that macroeconomics "has succeeded: Its central problem of depression prevention has been solved."
In his speech last week, Mr. Bernanke cited several assessments of the Great Moderation, including the one by the Fed economists. None questioned that it was wonderful.
The Fed chairman conceded that "one cannot look back at the Great Moderation today without asking whether the sustained economic stability of the period somehow promoted the excessive risk-taking that followed. The idea that this long period of calm lulled investors, financial firms and financial regulators into paying insufficient attention to building risks must have some truth in it."
One economist who would have expected that development was Hyman Minsky. In 1995, the year before Minsky died, Steve Keen, an Australian economist, used his ideas to set forth a possibility that now seems prescient. It was published in The Journal of Post Keynesian Economics.
He suggested that lending standards would be gradually reduced, and asset prices would rise, as confidence grew that "the future is assured, and therefore that most investments will succeed." Eventually, the income-earning ability of an asset would seem less important than the expected capital gains. Buyers would pay high prices and finance their purchases with ever-rising amounts of debt.
When something went wrong, an immediate need for liquidity would cause financiers to try to sell assets immediately. "The asset market becomes flooded," Mr. Keen wrote, "and the euphoria becomes a panic, the boom becomes a slump." Minsky argued that could end without disaster, if inflation bailed everyone out. But if it happened in a period of low inflation, it could feed upon itself and lead to depression.
"The chaotic dynamics explored in this paper," Mr. Keen concluded, "should warn us against accepting a period of relative tranquillity in a capitalist economy as anything other than a lull before the storm."
When I talked to Mr. Keen this week, he called my attention to the fact that Mr. Bernanke, in his 2000 book "Essays on the Great Depression," briefly mentioned, and dismissed, both Minsky and Charles Kindleberger, author of the classic "Manias, Panics and Crashes."
They had, Mr. Bernanke wrote, "argued for the inherent instability of the financial system but in doing so have had to depart from the assumption of rational economic behavior." In a footnote, he added, "I do not deny the possible importance of irrationality in economic life; however it seems that the best research strategy is to push the rationality postulate as far as it will go."
It seems to me that he had both Minsky and Kindleberger wrong. Their insight was that behavior that seems perfectly rational at the time can turn out to be destructive. As Robert J. Barbera, now the co-director of the Center for Financial Economics at Johns Hopkins University, wrote in his 2009 book, "The Cost of Capitalism," "One of Minsky's great insights was his anticipation of the 'Paradox of Goldilocks.' Because rising conviction about a benign future, in turn, evokes rising commitment to risk, the system becomes increasingly vulnerable to retrenchment, notwithstanding the fact that consensus expectations remain reasonable relative to recent history."
I asked Mr. Barbera for his evaluation of Mr. Bernanke's tenure. "He missed on the way in, big time," Mr. Barbera said, referring to the debt crisis, "but he appreciated what was happening, and very aggressively responded. It was not in the standard tool kit. But he did it. He did it aggressively, and he did it to good effect."
If Mr. Bernanke's successor, whoever he or she is, will take to heart the lesson that Mr. Bernanke missed during the good times -- that stability itself eventually becomes destabilizing -- the chances of a Great Recession II will be greatly reduced.

Abstract: "The risks remain that tight federal fiscal policy will restrain economic growth over the next few quarters by more than we currently expect, or that the debate concerning other fiscal policy issues, such as the status of the debt ceiling, will evolve in a way that could hamper the recovery," he told the committee. Mr. Bernanke revived a talking point from earlier this year, insisting the Fed was willing to buy more than $85 billion a month. "Because our asset purchases depend on economic and financial developments, they are by no means on a preset course," Mr. Bernanke told the committee.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, emphasized on Wednesday that the central bank remains committed to bolstering the economy, insisting that any deceleration in the Fed's stimulus campaign will happen because it is achieving its goals, not because it has lowered its sights.
Mr. Bernanke said he still expected to reach that point in the coming months but, in what may have been his final appearance before the House Financial Services Committee, he cautioned that Congress itself posed the greatest risk to growth.
"The risks remain that tight federal fiscal policy will restrain economic growth over the next few quarters by more than we currently expect, or that the debate concerning other fiscal policy issues, such as the status of the debt ceiling, will evolve in a way that could hamper the recovery," he told the committee.
The sluggish economy has been a constant background for Mr. Bernanke's biannual testimony. Unemployment, at 7.6 percent, remains stubbornly above the Fed's goals. Inflation has sagged to the lowest pace on record. Growth continues at a "modest to moderate pace," the Fed said Wednesday in its monthly beige book survey of economic conditions across the country, released separately from Mr. Bernanke's testimony.
Mr. Bernanke's message on Wednesday was that the Fed would cut back on its monthly asset purchases -- $85 billion of mortgage-backed securities and Treasury securities -- only if conditions were improving. If unemployment instead stays high and growth rates do not improve, the Fed will keep buying bonds. If inflation stays low, the Fed will keep buying bonds. If longer- term interest rates go up, the Fed will keep buying bonds.
Mr. Bernanke revived a talking point from earlier this year, insisting the Fed was willing to buy more than $85 billion a month. "Because our asset purchases depend on economic and financial developments, they are by no means on a preset course," Mr. Bernanke told the committee.
Even as Mr. Bernanke said that the Fed would keep its options open, he continued to suggest that the Fed would like to start reducing its asset purchases this year and then end them as soon as possible. If the economy needs more stimulus, the Fed would prefer to extend its policy of holding short-term interest rates near zero. Mr. Bernanke, who refers to this shift as "a change in the mix of tools," has not explained the rationale and was not asked to do so.
The Fed's course will not be determined by Mr. Bernanke much longer. He is widely expected to step down as Fed chairman at the end of his second term in January. Members of both parties took the opportunity to praise him, although Republicans generally added that they opposed the Fed's recent efforts. No one paid much attention to the finger Mr. Bernanke had pointed at them.
"You acted boldly and decisively and creatively -- very creatively, I might add," said the committee's chairman, Jeb Hensarling, Republican from Texas.
"You've had a lot of compliments today. In my business it's called a eulogy," said Emanuel Cleaver, a Missouri Democrat, who is an ordained minister.
"You have never been boring," said Carolyn Maloney, a New York Democrat.
Mr. Bernanke then did his best to be boring, sending the message to markets roiled by his comments last month that it was much ado about nothing.
Markets purred. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond sank slightly, falling below 2.5 percent, while stock markets posted modest gains.
The announcement last month that the Fed expected to reduce its asset purchases later this year drove up interest rates on mortgages and other loans. Some investors concluded that the Fed was curtailing its ambitions for the recovery, while others saw evidence that the Fed was overly optimistic in its forecasts.
Mr. Bernanke described that response as "unwelcome," but he said it had probably reduced some "excessively risky or leveraged positions" -- easing concerns among some Fed officials that its efforts are pumping up new bubbles.
He added that initial confusion about the Fed's plans appeared to have been replaced by a new equilibrium of slightly higher interest rates. "I think the markets are beginning to understand our message," Mr. Bernanke said.
And he downplayed concerns that the recent rate increases had undermined economic activity. "Housing activity and prices seem likely to continue to recover, notwithstanding the recent increases in mortgage rates," he said.
Analysts said that the strongest new signal Mr. Bernanke delivered in recent weeks concerned the sluggish pace of inflation. Prices rose just 1 percent during the 12 months ending in May, well below the 2 percent pace that the Fed considers healthy. Fed officials insisted for much of the year that inflation would rebound from the lowest pace on record. In recent weeks, the Fed has emphasized that it will take action if inflation does not. On Wednesday, Mr. Bernanke put inflation alongside unemployment as the justification for the Fed's continuing efforts.
"Our intention is to keep monetary policy highly accommodative for the foreseeable future, and the reason that's necessary is because inflation is below our target and unemployment is still quite high," Mr. Bernanke told the committee.
Michael Feroli, chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase, noted that Mr. Bernanke also cited the risk of deflation, something he had not done for several years. "The mention of deflation risks, rather than just low inflation, is a fairly strong statement coming from a sitting central bank chief," Mr. Feroli wrote.
Mr. Bernanke also emphasized that the Fed would not be satisfied with a decline in the unemployment rate if it was driven by people giving up the search for work rather than people finding new jobs. Importantly, he described this as a reason the Fed might extend its policy of low interest rates but not asset purchases.
The Fed has said that it plans to hold short-term rates near zero at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6.5 percent, but Mr. Bernanke has made clear in recent weeks that the Fed is likely to maintain the policy well beyond that threshold so long as inflation remains under control. He said on Wednesday that he believed that the unemployment rate could be cut to around 5.6 percent without causing prices to rise outside the Fed's preferred range.
His likely departure, however, means that his credibility increasingly depends on convincing investors that the rest of the Fed's policy-making committee shares his views and is committed to maintaining the same policies. That task has been complicated by the fragmentation of the committee's views about asset purchases. About half of the 19 officials who participate in meetings of the Fed's policy-making committee indicated before the committee's most recent meeting last month that they expected asset purchases to end later this year, while the rest -- including Mr. Bernanke -- saw a need for purchases into 2014.
Mr. Bernanke said Wednesday that his preferred timetable enjoyed "good support" from the committee, but it has not been codified in a policy statement.

Senate Reaches Deal to End Fight Over Student Loan Interest Rates

Abstract: Loans to parents of students would be given a rate of 4.6 percent plus the 10-year Treasury rate, with a cap of 10.5 percent. Because the Senate proposal hews closely to the one the House approved in May, the chances for a deal that can become law have greatly improved.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Senators negotiating a bipartisan deal to keep student loan rates low reached a deal on Wednesday night that could end the partisan feud on Capitol Hill that has threatened to permanently double interest rates.
Two Senate aides said that the new proposal, which had been the subject of tense negotiations since the rates doubled on July 1, would include both a cap on federal Stafford and PLUS loans and a relatively low interest rate pegged to Treasury notes. Undergraduates would pay the 10-year Treasury note rate, 2.49 percent on Wednesday, plus 2.05 percent, with a cap of 8.25 percent, to protect them from inflation. Graduate students would pay the 10-year Treasury rate plus 3.6 percent, with a cap of 9.5 percent.
Loans to parents of students would be given a rate of 4.6 percent plus the 10-year Treasury rate, with a cap of 10.5 percent.
Because the Senate proposal hews closely to the one the House approved in May, the chances for a deal that can become law have greatly improved. That may not happen until after Congress returns from its summer recess after Labor Day, and House and Senate negotiators have an opportunity to reconcile their plans.
The issue has been a problem for Democrats and Republicans in both houses of Congress. Without a deal, rates would double permanently. Congress now sets student loan rates, which were fixed at 3.4 percent in 2011. When Republicans took over the House, they vowed to get the government out of the business of playing banker to students and their families.
But in June 2012, just two days before the expiration date, Republicans buckled under pressure and extended the fixed rate for one year. This year, President Obama and both parties put forward their own plans.
House Republicans passed their plan in May and then went on the offensive against Democrats, who control the Senate. Senators of both parties have tried to reach a deal for weeks but fought over the cost.

Full text:   Coca-Cola reported disappointing second-quarter sales on Tuesday as global economic weakness and cool, wet weather crimped demand for soft drinks.
The company, the world's largest soda maker, said its revenue fell 3 percent, which was below its expectations, while its earnings fell 4 percent.
The company cited economic slowdowns in Europe and Asia, a consumer credit squeeze in Brazil and inflation in Mexico as reasons for the decrease. It also said a wet and cold spring in the United States, very early monsoons in India, and flooding in Central Europe curbed sales and overall consumer spending.
Coca-Cola's chief executive, Muhtar Kent, described the disappointing performance as an anomaly and a "confluence of events" that should not continue to occur. He said performance would improve in the second half of 2013, even though foreign exchange rates are expected to hurt company earnings by 4 percent, or double its previous estimate.
The summer weather is now more comparable with the previous year and performance should improve in Latin America, where social unrest in Brazil had interrupted sales.
Coca-Cola also expects sales in China, where volume was flat, to improve because of factors including a new management team, new packages and expanded distribution.
In the second quarter, ending June 28, Coca-Cola's net income dipped to $2.68 billion, or 59 cents a share, compared with $2.79 billion, or 61 cents a share, a year earlier.
Excluding items like restructuring charges and tax matters, the company earned 63 cents a share, in line with the average analyst estimates, according to Thomson Reuters.
Coca-Cola's revenue dropped 3 percent to $12.75 billion, from $13.09 billion a year earlier, missing analysts' expectations for $12.96 billion. Foreign exchange rates hurt revenue by 2 percent.
By region, sales volume fell 1 percent in North America and 4 percent in Europe, but rose in other international regions.

Abstract: Along with the leaders of Bolivia and Nicaragua, Mr. Maduro signaled recently that he was willing to offer asylum to Edward J. Snowden, the fugitive American former defense contractor who has been holed up in a Moscow airport seeking to avoid being sent back to the United States to face charges of leaking classified information about espionage programs.

Full text:   CARACAS, Venezuela -- President Nicolás Maduro refuses to refer to his longtime companion, Cilia Flores, as Venezuela's first lady, preferring to call her by the more ideologically resonant title "first combatant." Now he can also call her something else: his lawfully wedded wife.
Mr. Maduro and Ms. Flores were married on Monday after having resisted formally tying the knot for about two decades.
Mr. Maduro, who was elected by a narrow margin in April as the handpicked successor of former President Hugo Chávez, announced the surprise nuptials on Tuesday during a televised meeting with state governors. He said they had been married in a private ceremony attended by family members and presided over by Jorge Rodríguez, the mayor of a section of Caracas, who had served as his campaign manager.
"We want to send a very clear message about the strengthening of the Venezuelan family," Mr. Maduro said.
In photographs of the ceremony, the couple are dressed casually: he wears a white guayabera-style shirt, and she wears a white blouse and an off-white jacket.
In the months since the election, the president has struggled to confront a variety of stubborn problems, including high inflation, chronic shortages of basic goods, rampant violent crime and stagnating production in the all-important government-run oil industry.
Along with the leaders of Bolivia and Nicaragua, Mr. Maduro signaled recently that he was willing to offer asylum to Edward J. Snowden, the fugitive American former defense contractor who has been holed up in a Moscow airport seeking to avoid being sent back to the United States to face charges of leaking classified information about espionage programs.
Ms. Flores is a former attorney general and president of the National Assembly, and she is seen as playing an influential role in Mr. Maduro's administration. She is frequently at his side, traveling with him on trips abroad and around the country, and attending televised government events, including the governors' meeting on Tuesday.
The couple met after the failed 1992 coup led by Mr. Chávez, and both spent much of the past two decades as acolytes of the leftist leader. Ms. Flores has three children and Mr. Maduro one, all from previous marriages.

Full text:   6:24 p.m. | Updated The country's improving economy gave a nice lift to second-quarter earnings at Goldman Sachs.
The bank posted profit on Tuesday that was twice what it reported in the period a year earlier, fueled by strong trading and investment banking results as companies looked to Goldman to arrange mergers and acquisitions.
Net income was $1.93 billion, or $3.70 a share, compared with $962 million, or $1.78 a share, in the period a year earlier. The performance beat analysts' expectations for $2.82 a share, according to Thomson Reuters. Still, the results were not enough to propel Goldman shares higher. They closed at $160.24, down $2.76, or 1.7 percent. Investors, wondering if Goldman would be able to repeat the performance in coming quarters, opted to take some profit off the table rather than stick around and find out.
Goldman itself, while expressing optimism about the United States economy, was cautious about growth globally. Harvey Schwartz, Goldman's chief financial officer, said client activity improved during the quarter but was then damped a bit by "macro concerns" about countries like China.
"Ultimately our clients are assessing the broader global economy, specifically whether a recovering U.S. will offset potential slower growth in other economic regions," he told analysts during a conference call.
Goldman's results followed similar strong performances by JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup. Over all, Goldman's revenue in the quarter rose to $8.6 billion, from $6.6 billion in the period a year earlier.
On Wall Street, the last couple of months were dominated by a sudden and sharp rise in interest rates after the Federal Reserve indicated it might wind down its big bond purchase program, which has helped the economy recover from the financial crisis.
A rise in interest rates can both help and hurt banks, depending on the businesses they are in. As rates rise, fewer borrowers are likely to refinance or buy a house, and that reluctance can cut into banks' profit. Goldman, unlike its rival JPMorgan Chase, is not a big player in originating residential mortgages, but it does trade mortgages, and as rates increased, its revenue in this area fell. At the same time, the move by various central banks to raise rates ignited a flurry of currency trading, which helped Goldman and other banks.
On the analyst call, Mr. Schwartz, in response to a question, said investors needed to look into why rates were rising. If they are being driven by inflation, he said, that is more problematic than "returning to a normal world of more steady economic growth," as many investors believe. "That is what we are rooting for," he added.
The surge in interest rates was felt most acutely in Goldman's fixed-income, or bond, department. Net revenue in the unit was $2.46 billion, up 12 percent, reflecting what the company said was significant higher net revenue in currencies, credit products and commodities. Still, these increases were offset in part by significantly lower revenue in mortgages and interest-rate products.
The bank reduced the risk it was taking in products related to interest rates. The firm's so-called value-at-risk in rates declined to an average of $59 million in the second quarter from $83 million in the period a year earlier and $62 million in the first quarter. Value-at-risk is a yardstick of the amount of losses that could be experienced in one trading day.
The firm's annualized return on equity was 10.5 percent for the quarter, up from 5.4 percent in the period a year earlier. It was far below its performance in boom years like 2006, when its return on equity was 41.5 percent.
Revenue from investing and lending activities came in at $1.42 billion, up from just $203 million in the period a year earlier. The firm had a rather rocky second quarter in 2012, and its results in that quarter included a big loss on a significant investment in this unit.
Investment banking revenue rose 29 percent, to $1.6 billion, helped by significantly higher net revenue in debt and equity underwriting. Equity underwriting was a particular standout, jumping 55 percent, to $371 million. Debt underwriting rose 40 percent, to $695 million.
Goldman also disclosed that it had set aside $3.7 billion in the quarter for compensation, up 27 percent from the period a year earlier. The current accrual represents 43 percent of revenue, which is in line with other years. Banks like Goldman set aside compensation during the year but do not pay it out until they determine earnings for the full year.
Over the last year, Goldman has reduced its payroll to 31,700 employees, down 2 percent from the period a year earlier, as the firm continues to focus on cutting costs.
On the call, analysts also pressed Mr. Schwartz to disclose how close Goldman was to meeting leverage ratio requirements proposed recently by regulators -- 5 percent for the big bank holding companies and 6 percent for insured deposit-taking subsidiaries. The leverage ratio calculates capital as a percentage of assets held as a buffer against losses when investments go bad.
"Our first assessment is we're very comfortable with where we are," Mr. Schwartz said. Not satisfied, a Morgan Stanley analyst, Betsy Graseck, took another run at the question. "What is your definition of comfortable?" she asked.
"Comfortable," Mr. Schwartz responded. "I'm not trying to be cute with you. Look, it's just come out. Our team has looked at it. Our early read is all of the things we've done on the balance sheet over the past several years have left us reasonably well positioned."

Full text:   TEHRAN -- Iran's president-elect, Hassan Rowhani, painted a bleak picture of the country's economy on Monday, blaming the departing administration of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad for high inflation and unemployment, and saying it "has left much work to be done."
Mr. Rowhani said Mr. Ahmadinejad's government had presented a far-too-optimistic picture of the economy, which even according to official statistics is stumbling. "We asked current officials about the situation of the country," Mr. Rowhani said, "but their reports and those of our teams were very far from each other."
Speaking in Parliament, Mr. Rowhani said the inflation rate, officially listed as 32 percent, was 42 percent, the local news media reported. Iran's economy actually contracted during the past two years, he said, for the first time since the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s.
He said he was especially concerned about unemployment among educated young people. "According to our statistics," Mr. Rowhani said, "we will have 4.5 million unemployed university graduates four years from now."
But Mr. Ahmadinejad picked up some unexpected support from the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and other conservatives, who for months have criticized Mr. Ahmadinejad as incompetent and as someone who surrounded himself with corrupt elements.
"The respected president and his colleagues faced enormous tasks and operated rapidly in comparison with all the other governments," Ayatollah Khamenei said during a speech broadcast on Iran's state radio. "We must consider their huge workload, tireless efforts. This cabinet avoided comfort and grants, whereas most officials in the world and in the country benefit from them."
Mr. Rowhani's close aide Akbar Torkan, who acts as a liaison with Mr. Ahmadinejad's government, told the local news media that the economic state of the country was "much worse than expected."
Several lawmakers also criticized some last-minute decisions by the departing government. In one instance, Mr. Ahmadinejad transferred the largest plot of buildable land in the capital to the Voice and Vision organization, Iran's state broadcaster. That decision was accompanied by a ceremony lauding the president organized by the state broadcaster.
In another move, the central bank quietly cut the official value of the local currency, the rial, in half, so that a dollar now buys 24,500 rials, up from 12,260. While economists say the new figure still does not reflect the rial's true value, more than 30,000 to the dollar, it will help the government pay off outstanding debts to banks, but at the price of further stoking inflation and raising the prices of basic goods.
"They hypothetically made a huge amount of money," which they used reduce their debts with banks and other state organizations, Ahmad Tavakkoli, a lawmaker, told the semiofficial Mehr News Agency on Monday. "This is illegal and dangerous."
Mr. Ahmadinejad, who was barred by the Constitution from seeking a third four-year term, had seemingly fallen from grace in the months leading up to the June vote. He clashed with Parliament, the judiciary and the hard-line clerics who accused him and his entourage of secretly plotting to oust them from power.
The judiciary opened several corruption cases against Mr. Ahmadinejad's close associates, and the state newspaper, Kayhan, accused him of mismanaging the economy and undermining Ayatollah Khamenei.
On Sunday, however, the newspaper's editor in chief, Hossein Shariatmadari, accused reformists and enemies of the state of hatching a "big plot" against the departing government. "His government has been unprecedented," Mr. Shariatmadari wrote of Mr. Ahmadinejad. "His services are everlasting."
The change in attitude might signal a behind-the-scenes compromise, analysts say, or illustrate the tendency of Iran's governing establishment of hard-line clerics and commanders to close ranks in the end.
Mr. Rowhani has signaled his intention to pursue improved relations with the United States, though it remains unclear if he has the desire or the authority to soften Iran's position over its disputed nuclear program, an underlying cause of the estrangement. Iran insists that its program is peaceful, while the United States and other Western nations suspect that Iran is seeking the ability to build nuclear weapons. Negotiations stalled before Mr. Rowhani's successful election campaign.
On Monday, a group of 29 former, prominent American government officials, diplomats, military officers and national security experts sent a letter to President Obama, urging him to take advantage of Mr. Rowhani's signals. The letter called Mr. Rowhani's ascendance "a major potential opportunity to reinvigorate diplomatic efforts to resolve the standoff over Iran's nuclear program."
The letter was submitted a day after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, who has said many times that he regards a nuclear-armed Iran as an "existential threat," sought to increase the pressure on the Obama administration to take a tougher line with Iran and its newly elected president on the nuclear issue. Mr. Netanyahu said that the United States should intensify its sanctions and that the Iranians "have to know you'll be prepared to take military action; that's the only thing that will get their attention."

Abstract: "Pacific Rim," a robots-versus-monsters fantasy directed by Guillermo del Toro and intended to spawn a franchise, probably suffered from a crowded movie marketplace and a flawed advertising campaign, among other things.

Full text:   For the third weekend in a row, a big-budget nonsequel sputtered in North America: "Pacific Rim," which cost Legendary Entertainment and Warner Brothers at least $180 million to make, took in $38.3 million between Friday and Sunday, according to studio estimates. That result is a humiliation for Legendary, a young company that has been eager to prove that it can produce blockbusters on its own; Warner was a minority partner.
"Pacific Rim," a robots-versus-monsters fantasy directed by Guillermo del Toro and intended to spawn a franchise, probably suffered from a crowded movie marketplace and a flawed advertising campaign, among other things. Hollywood has smelled a flop for weeks, and both Legendary and Warner have scrambled to avoid having "Pacific Rim" branded as such. A Legendary spokesman noted on Sunday that audiences gave the movie an A-minus score in exit polls -- most critics also liked it -- and pointed to sturdier international ticket sales of about $53 million.
For the weekend in the United States and Canada, the animated "Despicable Me 2" (Universal) repeated as No. 1, taking in an estimated $44.8 million, for a stellar two-week domestic total of $229.2 million. The Adam Sandler ensemble comedy "Grown Ups 2" (Sony) was second, selling about $42.5 million in tickets, a little less than "Grown Ups" in 2010 when accounting for inflation, but a solid result nonetheless. "Pacific Rim" was third.

Syria Weighs Its Tactics, as the Pillars of Its Economy Continue to Crumble

Abstract: A faction that includes Kadri Jamil, a Russian-educated, socialist former professor who was appointed deputy prime minister in charge of the economy in a shake-up last year, hopes Syria can weather the storm by raising wages, tightening price controls on subsidized goods like bread, cracking down on black-market currency traders and even ceasing government trade in dollars and euros.

Full text:   BEIRUT, Lebanon -- Even as the Syrian government makes some gains against the rebels on the battlefield, it is taking a rout on an equally important front: the economy.
Two years of war have quintupled unemployment, reduced the Syrian currency to one-sixth of its prewar value, cost the public sector $15 billion in losses and damage to public buildings, slashed personal savings, and shrunk the economy 35 percent, according to government and United Nations officials.
The pillars of Syria's economy have crumbled as the war has destroyed factories, disrupted agriculture, vaporized tourism and slashed oil revenues, with America and Europe imposing sanctions and rebels taking over oil fields.
Increasingly isolated in the face of a growing economic crisis that has reduced foreign currency reserves to about $2 billion to $5 billion from $18 billion, a government that long prided itself on its low national debt and relative self-sufficiency has now been forced to rely on new credit lines from its main remaining allies -- Iran, Russia and China -- to buy food and fuel.
The government has a $1 billion credit line with Iran, and borrows $500 million a month to import oil products delivered on Russian ships, a government consultant, Mudar Barakat, said in a recent interview in Beirut. Some analysts believe the government will need even more aid from those countries to keep paying government workers and a growing roster of security forces.
Now, some officials hope to push through measures to tighten state control of the economy, rolling back some of the modest economic liberalization and support for private business that President Bashar al-Assad introduced early on, in a departure from his party's socialist roots.
"We're thinking of going back to the way it was in the 1980s, when the government was buying the main necessities of daily life," Mr. Barakat said. "We, as a government, must cover the daily needs of the people, no matter how much the cost is, and keep the prices low."
Syria's economic problems, in Mr. Barakat's view, are rooted in the loosening of state control by reformers favored early in Mr. Assad's tenure, who he said "vandalized" the economy "into this liberalized sort of chaos."
A faction that includes Kadri Jamil, a Russian-educated, socialist former professor who was appointed deputy prime minister in charge of the economy in a shake-up last year, hopes Syria can weather the storm by raising wages, tightening price controls on subsidized goods like bread, cracking down on black-market currency traders and even ceasing government trade in dollars and euros.
The government, Mr. Barakat said, now signs new foreign trade deals only in the currencies of friendly countries to insulate itself from what it sees as an economic conspiracy orchestrated by its international enemies.
But such measures -- met with ridicule and even defiance by some Syrian businesspeople -- will provide at best short-term relief, economists say.
Even the free-flowing aid from Iran and other allies inspires little confidence among Syrians, said an economist in Damascus who asked not to be identified publicly as criticizing government policies, because it shows the government "has no means and depends on others to save it."
A Damascus businessman derided the new policy of doing business in Iranian, Russian and Chinese currencies.
"These countries themselves do business in dollars and euros," he said, adding: "Syria today is not Syria in the 1980s. It is easy to keep the door closed, but it is hard to close it after it has been open 13 years and people are used to breathing the fresh air."
This month, the government banned food exports and announced a crackdown on black-market money traders. The value of the Syrian pound plunged to 330 to the dollar, down from 47 before the war.
On Wednesday, amid a flurry of panicked dealing, the Central Bank tried and failed to strong-arm traders into selling the Syrian pound at a higher, preset price. Dealers said Central Bank officials had offered to guarantee a tiny profit if they would sell the pound at a rate of 250.
The traders refused, several said. The government, they said, lacks the power to impose its will, in part because a few wealthy businessmen influence the dollar rate and corrupt officials profit from the trade.
The next day, currency exchange shops in the Damascus districts of Hariqa and Marjah were bustling. Customers clamored to change their savings into foreign currency -- Saudi riyals, Emirati dirhams, anything -- and traders shouted into phones, asking of the dollar, "How much is the green?"
Ammar, 35, a trader who gave only his first name for safety purposes, said the week's events showed the government had no clearer plan for the economic crisis than it did for the political or military ones. "The government doesn't understand the main problem or doesn't want to understand," he said. "Syrians no longer trust the Syrian pound."
Last week's currency crash deepened a steady decline that has helped send prices soaring even for basic foodstuffs and reduced most Syrians' buying power to a fraction of prewar levels, making it hard even for once-well-off families to afford meat and fish.
The economic crisis threatens one of the government's most crucial selling points. Syrians have long been envied in neighboring countries -- even by the Lebanese, with far more political freedom -- for the nation's social safety net and affordable goods.
On paper, Syria still provides free education and medical care and heavily subsidized fuel and food staples. But scores of hospitals have been destroyed or damaged, medical supplies are scarce, and bread and diesel sell for many times the official price.
Yet in a polarized country, it is unclear if economic troubles will turn more citizens against the government, which blames foreign-backed terrorists and profiteering merchants and bakers, who, Mr. Barakat said, "are playing a very dirty role."
"You could decide that you don't want to support the regime," said Jihad Yazigi, the editor of Syria Report, a Beirut-based economic journal. "But you can also blame the situation on other factors, like the sanctions and the opposition."
And economists said the inflation was likely to harm the population more than it hampers the war effort. The fall of the pound means it costs the government less to pay salaries.
The government recently raised government salaries by 40 percent. But in real terms that does not cover the loss in buying power. And at the same time, the Damascus economist noted, the government raised the official price of diesel, adding to the inflationary cycle.
The government still manages to pay salaries across the country -- even communicating by fax and messenger with rebel groups to arrange for them to rendezvous with trucks delivering cash, Mr. Barakat said. "The government employees come with the terrorists to pick them up," he said.
The government has a harder time with subsidies, spending far more to make bread than it charges, Mr. Barakat said, while shops and bakeries take advantage of subsidized diesel and then sell bread at market prices. "Basically," he said, "they are stealing the diesel."
Residents and bakers in opposition areas say that the government favors loyalist areas with supplies and that they have to buy diesel on the black market.

Full text:   TESTED 2014 Nissan GT-R Premium
WHAT IS IT? One of the quickest cars on the road at any price.
HOW MUCH? Base price, $100,590; as tested, $104,875 with $4,000 premium interior package and $285 floor mats.
WHAT MAKES IT RUN? A twin-turbocharged 3.8-liter V-6 (545 horsepower, 463 pound-feet of torque); 6-speed dual-clutch transmission; all-wheel drive.
IS IT THIRSTY? Compared with the Corvette and Porsche 911, yes. The E.P.A. rating is 16 m.p.g. in town, 23 on the highway.
I'd like to thank Mr. Tsunemi Ooyama for building the 3.8-liter V-6 that resides under the hood of a certain pearl-white Nissan GT-R. Nice work, Ooyama-san. Your efforts brought me much joy and helped to terrify numerous passengers unprepared for the violent acceleration unleashed by your twin-turbo handiwork. While the GT-R's motor has always been built by hand, the plaque identifying its constructor is new for 2014. It's time to give credit where credit is due.
Since its introduction as a 2009 model, the GT-R had only one year -- 2011 -- when it didn't undergo some type of improvement. More power, revised styling, improvements to the transmission and a host of other tweaks incrementally increased the performance year to year. And the GT-R wasn't exactly slow in the first place.
For 2014, the long list of tiny changes includes a new front suspension link location that helps to lower the front roll center. I'll admit I didn't perceive a problem with the old roll center, whatever it was.
I also had no qualm with the previous fuel injectors, which apparently didn't deliver satisfactory torque response from 4,500 to 6,000 r.p.m. The new premium interior, which pads the cabin with soft red leather, is very nice. But if you didn't order it, you probably wouldn't miss it.
With the GT-R, Nissan is like a party planner who obsesses over every spot on the silverware, fretting that the whole thing is a bust when all the guests are actually having a great time. But it's Nissan's party, and for 2014 they'll add an oil pan baffle if they want to.
In 2009, the base price was $70,850. The car I drove costs about $30,000 more than that. President Obama, Speaker Boehner: I plead for a bipartisan agreement to curb this disastrous GT-R inflation, which each year puts the Nissan farther and farther from the reach of hard-working, GT-R-wanting Americans.
Perhaps in part because of its six-figure price, a GT-R sighting remains an occasion. Through June, Nissan had sold only 624 of the cars in the United States. But those 624 people are in for a good time.
The often-repeated critiques of the GT-R -- that it's too heavy, too tech-laden, or that it sounds like a Flowbee for woolly mammoths -- seem to boil down to wishes that the GT-R were something other than what it is. This is not a thundering, minimalist Corvette Z06, nor a highly evolved anachronism like a Porsche 911. You could say that, like those cars, this Nissan has a technological tradition to uphold, but the GT-R's mission has always been to go as fast as possible using whatever technology furthers that goal. Turbos, high horsepower and all-wheel drive were a part of the GT-R mythology long before Americans ever got a taste of the car.
So, yes, the GT-R's front tires are going to dig in and help rocket you out of a hairpin without fear of spinning into the ditch. The V-6's intake noises will sound like someone's using the Large Hadron Collider to make margaritas. The middling fuel economy reflects the substantial mass hidden beneath that sinister bodywork.
But ultimately, the GT-R will do whatever you want it to do, at a performance level typically reserved for cars costing well above $100,000. Toggle the settings for the suspension and traction control and the GT-R will run from 0 to 60 m.p.h. in 3 seconds, spin a doughnut like a rear-drive Mustang or notch 1.2 gs on a corner. The fact that these abilities are enabled by computer-controlled clutches, yaw sensors and active differentials makes no difference to me. That's the GT-R identity, and that's what makes upper-echelon sports cars so interesting -- all the wildly different means to the same ends.
Besides, if the GT-R represents tech overload, what do we make of a moon module like the plug-in-hybrid Porsche 918 Spyder, which will also have a V-8? If you want to get nostalgic, let's start pining for the simple days when Tsunemi Ooyama could build a V-6 for a fast Nissan, and that was the only motor it had. EZRA DYER

Full text:   It was another high day on Wall Street -- barely.
After spending most of Friday flat or down, stocks rallied at the last minute and closed slightly higher, just enough to post new nominal highs for the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.
The gains were tiny. And the new high, which does not account for inflation, means little to investors, who hardly have more money now than they did a day earlier. But it is a sign that investors believe that the market's rally this year may not be over yet.
The S.& P. 500 has closed higher seven days in a row. The last time it did that was in March.
Investors had to look past a pessimistic forecast from United Parcel Service, which said it was expecting a slowdown in United States industry. And in the afternoon, Boeing shares slipped after one of the company's 787 jets had a fire in London, reviving fears of the troubles that the plane had with batteries this year.
Other economic news was mixed. Profits at Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase were better than expected, and that helped financial stocks. But a University of Michigan measure of consumer sentiment came in lower than expected for this month.
Investors will get a lot more information next week, when major reports on inflation and retail sales are due. That is also when the pace of company earnings reports will pick up sharply. Results are due from the remaining big banks, as well as General Electric, Intel, Microsoft and other industry bellwethers.
The Dow closed up 3.38 points, just 0.02 percent, at 15,464.30. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 5.17 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,680.19. Both indexes also closed at nominal highs on Thursday.
The Nasdaq composite edged up 21.78 points, or 0.6 percent, to 3,600.08. It is still well short of its record high of 5,048, set in March 2000.
All the big indexes ended the week ahead 2 percent or more.
In government bonds, the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 5/32 to 92 24/32, sending the yield up to 2.59 percent, from 2.57 percent late Thursday.
Shares in U.P.S. sank $5.33, or 5.8 percent, to $86.12 after the company said its second-quarter and full-year earnings would be less than analysts had projected because the company's customers were using cheaper shipping options. U.P.S. also said it was seeing a slowdown in American industry.
FedEx shares fell, too, down $2.11, or 2 percent, to $102.29.
Cost-cutting lifted profits at Wells Fargo, and its stock rose 74 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $42.63. JPMorgan Chase reported a 32 percent jump in profits, but its stock fell 17 cents to $54.97.
Anthony Conroy, managing director and head trader for the ConvergEx Group, said JPMorgan's credit numbers were strong. "That means the consumer's out there spending and borrowing and propping up the whole economy, and that's a good thing," he said.
Mr. Conroy said he expected stocks to rise as long as second-quarter earnings reports at least matched the low expectations that investors have. "The three most important things in the next couple of weeks are earnings, earnings and earnings," he said.

Full text:   TOKYO -- Three months into Japan's bid to reinflate its economy after years of falling prices, the country's central bank said on Thursday that economic conditions were starting to recover, signaling its confidence that the world's third-largest economy was on the cusp of a long-awaited turnaround.
It was the first time since January 2011, before Japan's natural and nuclear disasters in March that year, that the Bank of Japan had ventured to use the word "recover." The bank's message was underpinned by a rebound in Japan's mainstay exports, helped by a weaker yen, and some signs of a broader recovery in consumer spending.
Reflecting its optimism, the central bank's policy-setting board left its monetary policy unchanged and stuck to its goal of hitting 2 percent inflation in two years. To get money flowing again in the Japanese economy, the bank, led by its governor, Haruhiko Kuroda, has pledged to pump 60 trillion to 70 trillion yen, or about $600 billion to $700 billion, into the economy annually.
"Japan's economy is starting to recover moderately," the bank said in a statement released at the end of its two-day meeting. For proof, the bank pointed to a pickup in corporate investment and profits, industrial production, and both business and consumer sentiment.
Japan's economy is now growing faster than any of the Group of 7's leading economies, recording an annualized rate of 4.1 percent in gross domestic product in the first three months of the year. This week, the International Monetary Fund raised its outlook for Japan to 2 percent growth for 2013, putting it well ahead of its G-7 peers. The Tokyo stock market has gained 40 percent this year.
Economists, along with the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, have taken to calling his economic program "Abenomics." The term has been featured prominently in campaigning for the July 21 elections for Japan's upper house of Parliament, which Mr. Abe's ruling Liberal Democratic Party is expected to win by a landslide.
Still, the central bank acknowledged that it could take time for an all-around recovery in prices to take hold after 15 years of deflation. The year-over-year rate of change in consumer prices, excluding fresh food, is still zero, it said, though some indicators suggested a rise in inflation expectations.
At the same time, anxiety over volatility in government bond markets have also receded in recent weeks, after the bank adjusted the way it conducts its purchases in that market, minimizing any disruption. Despite Japan's sky-high public debt, long-term interest rates remain far lower than those in the United States or in Europe.
Even as the United States Federal Reserve Bank debates when to phase out its stimulus, the focus in Japan has turned to when the central bank might push ahead with more easing. But the bank's willingness to stand pat on monetary policy, and on its 2 percent inflation target, suggests that the bank is comfortable with letting its program play out in the wider economy for now, economists said.
In a note to clients, Kyohei Morita, a Japan economist at Barclays Capital, said that he was pushing back his projection for further easing from the central bank to next April, from an earlier forecast of October this year. A slowdown in government spending as the postdisaster reconstruction demand winds down could hurt growth projections for 2014 and force the bank's hand, he said.
He said he was optimistic that growth, for now, would receive wide support from strong consumer spending, buttressed not only by improving consumer sentiment but also by the impending retirement of the country's postwar baby boomers, who are expected to turn en masse from net savers to net spenders.
"Japan's economy is increasingly characterized by strong personal consumption, supported by Abenomics and the baby boomer generation," Mr. Morita said.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve Chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said on Wednesday that the Fed was likely to extend the centerpiece of its campaign to bolster the economy -- keeping short-term interest rates close to zero -- even as it prepares to wind down another key stimulus program that faces mounting internal opposition.
Mr. Bernanke has begun to prepare the way for the Fed to scale back on its effort to cut borrowing costs for businesses and consumers through the monthly purchase of vast quantities of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities. Although a growing number of Fed officials want the bond buying to end more quickly, Mr. Bernanke sought on Wednesday to emphasize that an end to bond buying would not signal a broader change in the Fed's commitment to support economic expansion and reduce unemployment.
"The overall message is accommodation," Mr. Bernanke told a gathering of economists in Cambridge, Mass. "There is some prospective, gradual and possible change in the mix of instruments, but that shouldn't be confused with the overall thrust of policy."
The Fed has said that it plans to hold short-term interest rates near zero at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6.5 percent. Mr. Bernanke echoed recent remarks by other Fed officials in suggesting that the Fed was likely to maintain its suppression of short-term interest rates for some time after unemployment dropped below that threshold, and that officials were considering lowering the threshold.
Mr. Bernanke and other Fed officials have not fully explained this emerging shift in their strategy, in part because they do not seem to agree. Some officials say that asset purchases have been effective but are no longer necessary. Other officials say the purchases have failed to meet expectations. Still others say they are worried that the purchases could destabilize financial markets.
The Fed began last September to expand its holdings of Treasuries and mortgage bonds by $85 billion a month, the third major expansion of its investment holdings since the financial crisis. It now owns more than $3 trillion in bonds.
Mr. Bernanke said last month, after the most recent meeting of the Fed's policy-making committee, that the central bank planned to gradually taper its monthly bond purchases starting later this year and ending in the middle of next year, so long as economic growth continues.
But "about half" of the 19 officials who participated in the policy meeting said in an internal survey beforehand "that it likely would be appropriate to end asset purchases late this year," according to an account of the meeting that the Fed released Wednesday after a standard delay.
The account does not imply an earlier endpoint to the bond-buying program. Only 12 of the 19 officials vote each year, and proponents of a later end date still command a majority of the votes. Moreover, officials have said repeatedly that the timing will depend on economic conditions, in particular on evidence that the labor market outlook has improved substantially.
That is a standard the economy has yet to meet, at least to the satisfaction of the majority that backs the bond-buying program, known as quantitative easing. The account underscored that a decision to decelerate later this year still hangs in the balance.
"Many members indicated that further improvement in the outlook for the labor market would be required before it would be appropriate to slow the pace of asset purchases," the account said. "Some added that they would, as well, need to see more evidence that the projected acceleration in economic activity would occur, before reducing the pace of asset purchases."
Mr. Bernanke's earlier announcement that the Fed intended to dial back the pace of its purchases later this year unsettled investors who have staked vast sums on the Fed's plans. Longer-term borrowing costs rose, in part because of the assertion that the economy was doing better and in part because of the suggestion that the central bank intended to provide less help than investors had expected.
The average rate on a 30-year home mortgage has increased from 3.35 percent in early May to 4.29 percent last week, according to Freddie Mac, causing refinancing to diminish and raising questions about whether higher rates might soon start affecting home buying.
A flurry of follow-up speeches by Fed officials helped to stabilize markets, but did not reverse the initial rise in interest rates.
The impact of the latest information remains to be seen. The stock market fell in the hour after the Fed released the meeting account; the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index ended the trading day almost exactly where it started. As Mr. Bernanke took questions after the markets closed, stocks rose and interest rates fell in limited after-hours trading.
The minutes of last month's meeting make clear that opposition to the bond-buying program has steadily increased as officials who initially supported the purchases have concluded that the program should come to an end. But the diversity of views about the proper timetable makes it harder to predict when tapering of quantitative easing is likely to begin or end.
"Ambiguities abound," wrote Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. Eric Green, global head of rates and commodities research at TD Securities, called it "the Rorschach minutes," because it confirmed preconceptions of all kinds.
"The minutes do not provide a clearer understanding of when the Fed will taper," Mr. Green wrote. "However, it does demonstrate the appetite for QE is demonstrably lower though each meeting and on this front makes the minutes feel less dovish than we expected."
Officials are concerned that bond buying could destabilize financial markets, although the account said that so far, "The system's purchases of longer-term assets do not appear to have had an adverse effect on the functioning of markets."
Still officials argue that asset purchases have uncertain benefits and uncertain consequences, and it is best to move cautiously in dark rooms.
"The claim that the Fed is responding insufficiently to the shocks hitting the economy rests on the assumption that policy is made with complete certainty about the effects of policy on the economy," John Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, wrote in a research paper published on Tuesday. "Nothing could be further from the truth. Once one recognizes uncertainty, some moderation in monetary policy may well be optimal."
Extending the suppression of short-term interest rates may help the Fed convince investors that it is not staging a broader retreat.
Narayana Kocherlakota, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, said in a recent speech that the Fed should declare an intention to suppress interest rates so long as unemployment tops 5.5 percent.
"This additional clarity about future policy actions will tend to push downward on a variety of market interest rates and provide needed current stimulus," he said.
Many Fed officials, according to the meeting account, also are worried about the sluggish pace of inflation, trundling along at 1 percent a year, well below the 2 percent pace the Fed considers healthy. Extending low interest rates could help lift inflation.
"We are all very much committed to defending our inflation target from below as well as from above," Mr. Bernanke said.

Full text:   Friday's employment report wasn't bad. But given how depressed our economy remains, we really should be adding more than 300,000 jobs a month, not fewer than 200,000. As the Economic Policy Institute points out, we would need more than five years of job growth at this rate to get back to the level of unemployment that prevailed before the Great Recession. Full recovery still looks a very long way off. And I'm beginning to worry that it may never happen.
Ask yourself the hard question: What, exactly, will bring us back to full employment?
We certainly can't count on fiscal policy. The austerity gang may have experienced a stunning defeat in the intellectual debate, but stimulus is still a dirty word, and no deliberate job-creation program is likely soon, or ever.
Aggressive monetary action by the Federal Reserve, something like what the Bank of Japan is now trying, might do the trick. But far from becoming more aggressive, the Fed is talking about "tapering" its efforts. This talk has already done real damage; more on that in a minute.
Still, even if we don't and won't have a job-creation policy, can't we count on the natural recuperative powers of the private sector? Maybe not.
It's true that after a protracted slump, the private sector usually does find reasons to start spending again. Investment in equipment and software is already well above pre-recession levels, basically because technology marches on, and businesses must spend to keep up. After six years during which hardly any new homes were built in America, housing is trying to stage a comeback. So yes, the economy is showing some signs of healing itself.
But that healing process won't go very far if policy makers stomp on it, in particular by raising interest rates. That's not an idle worry. A Fed chairman famously declared that his job was to take away the punch bowl just as the party was really warming up; unfortunately, history offers many examples of central bankers pulling away the punch bowl before the party even starts.
And financial markets are, in effect, betting that the Fed is going to offer another such example. Long-term interest rates, which mainly reflect expectations about future short-term rates, shot up after Friday's job report -- a report that, to repeat, was at best just O.K. Housing may be trying to bounce back, but that bounce now has to contend with sharply rising financing costs: 30-year mortgage rates have risen by a third since the Fed started talking about relaxing its efforts about two months ago.
Why is this happening? Part of the reason is that the Fed is constantly under pressure from monetary hawks, who always want to see tighter money and higher interest rates. These hawks spent years warning that soaring inflation was just around the corner. They were wrong, of course, but rather than change their position they have simply invented new reasons -- financial stability, whatever -- to advocate higher rates. At this point it's clear that monetary hawkery is mainly a form of Puritanism in H. L. Mencken's sense -- "the haunting fear that someone, somewhere may be happy." But it remains dangerously influential.
Unfortunately, there's also a technical issue that plays into the prejudices of the monetary hawks. The statistical techniques policy makers often use to estimate the economy's "potential" -- the maximum level of output and employment it can achieve without inflationary overheating -- turn out to be badly flawed: they interpret any sustained economic slump as a decline in potential, so that the hawks can point to charts and spreadsheets supposedly showing that there's not much room for growth.
In short, there's a real risk that bad policy will choke off our already inadequate recovery.
But won't voters eventually demand more? Well, that's where I get especially pessimistic.
You might think that a persistently poor economy -- an economy in which millions of people who could and should be productively employed are jobless, and in many cases have been without work for a very long time -- would eventually spark public outrage. But the political science evidence on economics and elections is unambiguous: what matters is the rate of change, not the level.
Put it this way: If unemployment rises from 6 to 7 percent during an election year, the incumbent will probably lose. But if it stays flat at 8 percent through the incumbent's whole term, he or she will probably be returned to power. And this means that there's remarkably little political pressure to end our continuing, if low-grade, depression.
Someday, I suppose, something will turn up that finally gets us back to full employment. But I can't help recalling that the last time we were in this kind of situation, the thing that eventually turned up was World War II.

Full text:   FRANKFURT -- Answering critics who said they were running out of ways to promote growth and lending, the European Central Bank and the Bank of England on Thursday did something neither had done before, committing themselves to keeping interest rates low indefinitely.
The bid to reassure investors brought the two central banks into closer alignment with the Federal Reserve, which, under Chairman Ben S. Bernanke, has become more open about its intentions.
At the same time, they appeared eager to signal that they would not follow the Fed in preparing for a gradual withdrawal of economic stimulus.
Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, based in Frankurt, said at a news conference that crucial interest rates would "remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time." Until Thursday, the bank had steadfastly refused to pin itself down on future policy.
"It's not six months," Mr. Draghi said. "It's not 12 months. It's an extended period of time."
Mr. Draghi also said that the central bank was signaling a "downward bias" in interest rate policy, meaning further cuts were possible or even likely.
Only hours earlier, Mark J. Carney, who became governor of the Bank of England on Monday, made a similar break with tradition. The British central bank said in a statement that any expectations that interest rates would rise soon from their current record low level were misguided.
With their promises of easy money stretching toward the horizon, the central bankers offered more certainty to investors at a time when tensions in Europe are rising again. So-called forward guidance is considered one of the tools available to central banks, but it was one the European Central Bank and the Bank of England had not used before.
European markets reacted positively to the announcements, with the FTSE 100 in London closing 3.1 percent higher and the Euro Stoxx 50, a benchmark of euro zone blue chips, climbing 3 percent. (Markets in the United States were closed for the Fourth of July holiday.) The euro fell sharply, a development that was probably not unwelcome at the European Central Bank, since a cheaper euro makes European products less expensive in foreign markets, feeding exports. The British pound also fell.
Mr. Draghi said it was a coincidence that his central bank and Bank of England introduced forward guidance on the same day. Both left their main interest rates at 0.5 percent and did not announce any other policy moves. It was a day for talk rather than action.
"Mr. Draghi did what he does best today: intervene verbally to great effect," Nicholas Spiro, managing director of Spiro Sovereign Strategy in London, said in a note.
Mr. Draghi's statement on Thursday came almost a year after he defused the euro zone debt crisis with a promise to do "whatever it takes" to preserve the currency union.
But after months of relative calm, Europe has been rattled in recent days by a political crisis in Portugal, which has raised questions about whether the region's governments will be able to withstand popular discontent with their policies of cutting budgets to bring public debt under control. Investors have responded by pushing up the risk premium they demand on bonds issued by Italy, Spain and other troubled euro zone countries. Market rates on Italian and Spanish bonds retreated on Thursday after Mr. Draghi's comments.
The commitment to keep rates low helps amplify the effect of rates that are already nearly rock bottom, by reassuring investors that they can count on easy money for the foreseeable future.
But some analysts saw Mr. Draghi's statement as a bluff -- a tacit admission that the central bank has run out of other ways to stimulate the euro zone economy.
"A change of a few words in the way he phrases the E.C.B.'s policy stance is an insufficient policy response to alter the -- very troubled -- course of the euroland economy," Carl B. Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y., said in an e-mail.
Though the central bank remains unwilling to stimulate the economy as aggressively as the Fed, it promised last year to buy government bonds in unlimited amounts to bring down the issuing governments' rates and counteract fears of a euro zone breakup. By the central bank's standards, that was a bold promise, even if the bank has not been forced to deliver on it yet. The shift to forward guidance on Thursday could be seen as another expansion of the central bank's arsenal.
In a further, more tentative break with precedent, Mr. Draghi said that monetary policy would be guided by changes in the rate of inflation, the state of the euro zone economy and indicators of the money supply. Previously, the central bank emphasized inflation above all else. But Mr. Draghi would not elaborate on what economic benchmarks the bank might use to guide policy.
Mr. Draghi suggested that, with inflation well below the central bank's official target of about 2 percent, the bank has room to focus on other factors.
"We do believe that we have an outlook for inflation in the medium term that would justify this new way of communicating," he said. The bank's governing council, which met on Thursday, unanimously endorsed the shift in verbal strategy, he said.
The Bank of England has been less restrained than the European Central Bank since the financial crisis began in 2008, buying bonds on a vast scale as a way to push down market interest rates, a strategy very similar to that used by the Fed. The Fed has amassed more than $3 trillion in Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities, and since December it has been expanding those holdings at the rate of $85 billion a month. It has also said it intends to hold short-term interest rates near zero for as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6.5 percent.
At the same time, recent comments by Mr. Bernanke looking ahead to a time when the Fed will begin tightening its monetary policy have caused turmoil in global financial markets and probably put pressure on the European Central Bank and the Bank of England to clarify their own intentions.
"Our exit is very distant," Mr. Draghi said, though he refused to say how many months or years that might be.
That the Bank of England even issued a statement after its monetary policy meeting was a departure from previous practice and showed that Mr. Carney, the former governor of the Canadian central bank, is making his mark just days after taking office.
"The drop in the pound is a byproduct of the comments, and the market reaction indicates just how eager it is for comments from the new regime," said Peter Dixon, an economist at Commerzbank.
The British central bank also held its bond-buying program at £375 billion, or $570 billion. Recent data from the services and manufacturing industries surprised some economists by showing faster rates of growth.
The bank said it decided not to change its stimulus program and benchmark interest rate, which it calls the bank rate, because "there have been further signs that a recovery is in train, although it remains weak by historical standards and a degree of slack is expected to persist for some time."
As for the euro zone, Mr. Draghi affirmed his view that the economy was gradually improving but remained fragile.
"Euro area economic activity should stabilize and recover in the course of the year, albeit at a subdued pace," he said.

To mainstream economists, Mr. Mosler and his adherents represent something of a counterpoint to the handful of academics on the right who believe the United States should return to the gold standard because the government is supposedly going bankrupt and the Federal Reserve under Ben S.

Full text:   CHRISTIANSTED, V.I. -- Warren Mosler is a card-carrying member of the 1 percent. A deeply tanned, tennis-lean hedge fund executive, Mr. Mosler lives on this run-down but jewel-toned Caribbean island for tax reasons. Transitioning into an active retirement, he recently designed and had built an $850,000 catamaran called Knot My Problem. He whizzes around St. Croix in a white, low-slung sports car he created himself, too.
But his prescriptions for economic policy make him sound like a warrior for the 99 percent. When the recession hit, Mr. Mosler said, the government should have spent and spent until unemployment came down to a comfortable level. Forget saving the banks through the Troubled Asset Relief Program. Washington should have eliminated the payroll tax, given every state $500 per resident and offered a basic job to anyone who wanted one.
"There would have been no recession," Mr. Mosler, 63, said over a salad at a hole-in-the-wall seaside cafe called Rum Runners.
Washington's debts would have soared, of course. But Mr. Mosler sees no problem with that. A failed Senate candidate in Connecticut with unorthodox but attention-grabbing economic theories, he says he believes the United States should be running much bigger deficits and that the last thing the government needs to worry about is balancing its budget.
Mr. Mosler's ideas, which go under the label of "modern monetary theory," or M.M.T., are clearly on the fringe, drawing skeptical reactions even from many liberal Keynesian economists who agree with some of his arguments. But they have attracted a growing following, flourishing on the Internet and in a handful of academic outposts, as he and others who share his thinking have made the case that austerity budgeting in the United States and in Europe is doing irreparable harm.
Like many Keynesian economists, Mr. Mosler and other modern monetary theorists are particularly disturbed by the longstanding campaign articulated and financed by Peter G. Peterson, a former commerce secretary who co-founded the Blackstone Group private equity fund, to reduce the deficit or else.
"There's a whole deficit lobby of Peterson-funded groups arguing we're turning into Greece," said James K. Galbraith, an economist at the University of Texas at Austin. "They're blowing smoke and the M.M.T. group has patiently explained why."
Still, even for those with some knowledge of economics, the tenets of the modern monetary theory can make your head spin. The government does not tax its citizens to pay for federal spending. It taxes them to ensure they use the dollar and to help to regulate demand. Since the government prints the dollar, it can never run out of money and it need never balance its budget, not even to prevent the crowding out of private investment when the economy is humming along.
What about inflation? "What about it?" Mr. Mosler replied. "How can the United States have $16 trillion in debt and still be on the verge of deflation, even when Chairman Bernanke's using every alphabet-soup trick in his book?"
To mainstream economists, Mr. Mosler and his adherents represent something of a counterpoint to the handful of academics on the right who believe the United States should return to the gold standard because the government is supposedly going bankrupt and the Federal Reserve under Ben S. Bernanke is debasing the currency.
"They deny the fact that the government use of real resources can drive the real interest rate up," said Mark Thoma, an economics professor and widely followed blogger who teaches at the University of Oregon. After delving into the technical details of modern monetary theory for a few minutes, he paused, then added, "I think it's just nuts."
But just as a return to the gold standard has attracted a popular following -- including many supporters of Ron Paul, the charismatic former Texas congressman -- so has modern monetary theory, which has been spread on the great stage of the Web. A thriving academic blogosphere brings ideas up and knocks them down, and popular sites like Business Insider and Naked Capitalism have given modern monetary theorists a platform to join in.
"These ideas definitely aren't disseminated through published academic journals," said Stephanie Kelton, an economist at University of Missouri-Kansas City, who coined the term "deficit owls" to distinguish modern monetary theorists from "deficit hawks." "It's all on the Internet."
Mr. Mosler has played a pivotal role in promoting the theory, and unlike many economists he has the resources to do so. He runs a popular blog called the Center of the Universe, a sly joke, perhaps, given that tiny, tropical St. Croix, which is about 1,200 miles from Miami, is the easternmost point in the United States. He eagerly appears on radio programs and on television. Recently, he went on a tour of Italy to promote his anti-austerity ideas.
He has also helped to build an infrastructure to mint new modern monetary theorists, helping to found the Center for Full Employment and Price Stability at the University of Missouri-Kansas City, and financing a small army of graduate students. "Someone once said that economics advances one funeral at a time," Mr. Mosler said, chuckling. "The hope is that we have a generation of economists coming up who really understand how things work and can put those ideas to a public purpose."
There were also a few self-financed political campaigns, including some fruitless races in the Virgin Islands. In his 2012 run, Mr. Mosler said he believed the voting was rigged. He made a vanity run for Senate in Connecticut in 2010 as an independent, making waves by offering to use $100 million of his own money to pay down the deficit if any member of Congress could prove that government spending was actually constrained by tax revenue. He came in third, with about 1 percent of the vote. "It was a mistake," Mr. Mosler said of running in Connecticut. "It did get the ideas out there, though."
Mr. Mosler started his career at a small bank in Connecticut, and eventually became a Wall Street trader. It was there, he said, that he developed an intuitive understanding of how the economy works -- one very different from that of policy makers in Washington and the vast bulk of academics.
"All debt management is, is debiting and crediting different accounts," Mr. Mosler said, recalling seeing numbers appear and disappear from his computer at Bankers Trust in New York in the 1970s. "Can the federal government run out of dollars? No, because the Fed could pipe in a bigger number. That number doesn't come from anywhere. It's like when a player scores a field goal at a stadium. Three points just appear. The government is just the scorekeeper for the dollar."
In the early 1980s, he left Wall Street and along with a partner, Clifford Viner, who is now the owner of the Florida Panthers hockey team, founded a hedge fund in Boca Raton, Fla. The fund made relatively few, relatively complicated financial bets, said Michael Reger, a partner of Mr. Mosler's for the last 20 years. "He's an urban myth," Mr. Reger said of the affable, talkative and bookish Mr. Mosler.
Mr. Mosler's fund has made a number of bets informed by his theory. For instance, Mr. Reger said, when the Treasury was paying down the United States debt during the Clinton years, many bond traders thought that prices would spike because of increasing scarcity. But Mr. Mosler predicted that no such scarcity would ever materialize, and shorted the bonds.
That trade panned out, though others have not. The business lost hundreds of millions of dollars betting that Russia would not default on its debts. That country's fixed exchange rate spurred it to go belly up, Mr. Mosler said.
On the side, he ran Mosler Automotive, which created several dozen low-slung, lightweight, superfast sports cars over its nearly 30 years in business. That passion project never quite worked out, he said, and he is now in the process of selling it off. "The Consulier got named one of the 50 worst cars ever made by Time magazine," he said with a laugh. "Look it up!"
But entering retirement, Mr. Mosler has more than enough work to do promoting his monetary theories, he said.
"Economics is about the allocation of scarce resources," Mr. Mosler said. "If there's a food shortage, you have a real problem in divvying up the food. Right now, we have a dollar shortage because of mistaken notions about how the monetary system works. How does that make any sense?"

Abstract: In recent years, Ecuador has become a favorite of American retirees on a budget looking for a place to while away their golden years, and some of the same features that appeal to them may also be attractive to Mr. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor who is wanted in the United States on espionage charges. International Living magazine has listed Ecuador as the top destination several years in a row for retirees looking to live abroad, citing its low cost of living, including inexpensive real estate and rents, and good, affordable medical care.

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDEDQUITO, Ecuador -- The only authorized dealer for Apple computers here, where the intelligence leaker Edward J. Snowden had hoped to take refuge, is called Mundomac. The name means WorldMac, but it is a pretty small world indeed. There are only three laptops and two desktop computers on display at the store in one of Quito's top malls, plus two iPads, an iPad mini and a couple of iPods. The tiny shop is nowhere near the size of one of Apple's flagship emporia in New York or other major cities.
"Computers, cellphones, Internet, all of those things, they're four or five years behind," Lars Pedersen, a Danish Web site designer who lives here, said of the state of technology in Ecuador. Then, standing outside the Mundomac store in the Quicentro Mall, he issued the ultimate techie put-down: "They still think BlackBerrys are cool."
The chances that Mr. Snowden will end up here -- or any other country, for that matter -- are growing more fleeting by the day. Of the 21 countries Mr. Snowden asked for asylum, only Venezuela and Bolivia appeared to offer him hope of escaping the international airport transit lounge at Sheremetyevo airport in Moscow, where he has been ensconced out of public view for nine days. Ecuador has said it will consider granting him asylum if he can get here, or to one of the country's embassies abroad.
In truth, however, this was never the ideal refuge for a technology geek addicted to his laptop -- Mr. Snowden was said to be horrified by the prospect of being imprisoned without access to a computer. He would very likely find life in tiny, beautiful, impoverished Ecuador a bit of an adjustment.
Internet speeds are not what they are back home. You can forget about smoothly streaming that cool new video on your iPhone. And there are no Starbucks.
"This Snowden guy is going to be very bored," said Mr. Pedersen, who runs a company that creates Web sites. But he offered a diversion: "I'll give him a job if he comes here."
And yet, while Ecuador may not be the Silicon Valley of the Andes, it has many things going for it, according to Americans and other foreigners who have settled here.
Most talked about the gorgeous landscapes and natural diversity, which ranges from Pacific beaches to snow-covered Andean peaks, green mountain valleys and the jungle of the Amazon basin, all packed into a country about the size of Nevada, with 15.4 million people.
In recent years, Ecuador has become a favorite of American retirees on a budget looking for a place to while away their golden years, and some of the same features that appeal to them may also be attractive to Mr. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor who is wanted in the United States on espionage charges.
International Living magazine has listed Ecuador as the top destination several years in a row for retirees looking to live abroad, citing its low cost of living, including inexpensive real estate and rents, and good, affordable medical care.
There is also plenty to make a homesick American feel more at home. Ecuador uses the dollar as its currency, having "dollarized" its economy in 2000 and dropped the national currency, the sucre, after a banking crisis and a period of high inflation in the 1990s.
While Quito has beautifully preserved colonial churches and other historic buildings, the country is chock-full of American chains. Sitting in Bigoté, a tea shop frequented by Americans in Cumbayá, a well-off suburb of Quito, one can look out at a panorama of shopping malls that include a McDonald's, a K.F.C., T.G.I. Friday's, a Payless Shoe Source, a Nike store and a Chevrolet dealership.
And despite the fact that he is wanted for espionage crimes by the United States and some politicians there have called him a traitor, if Mr. Snowden were to gain asylum here he seems likely to get a warm reception from many Americans.
"I would give him a high five and invite him to my house for dinner," said Robin Fink, 25, who is from California but has lived for about three years in Quito and volunteers for a group that advocates for women's health issues. "What he did was heroic."
"The less secrets the better," said Ronny Lane, 53, an Air Force veteran who did duty during the first Persian Gulf war and the war in Afghanistan, and came to live in Ecuador seven years ago after retiring from his job as an assistant fire chief in Mississippi. "What is it he's outed? That the C.I.A.'s monitoring people? You'd have to be in a coma not to know that."
Drinking with pals in a dark wood-paneled Cumbayá bar called St. Andrews, a copy of many suburban watering holes in the United States, Mr. Lane said that the American community in Ecuador tended to be fairly liberal, including a lot of "retired college professors and nature-type people." Of Mr. Snowden, he said, "No doubt in my mind, he'll fit in."
Sipping from a glass of mineral water, Mr. Lane offered some advice for newcomers.
"When you come here, throw that gringo mentality out of your head," Mr. Lane said. He said the hardest thing for many new arrivals to accept was the pervasive corruption, like police officers soliciting bribes for minor traffic stops.
"Life here is not easy like it is in the United States," said Cody Leigh Brown, 30, the owner of the Bigoté tea shop, who is from Montana and has lived for four years in Ecuador (she would give Mr. Snowden a free lunch and coffee). "You're going to miss a lot of the first-world concepts. We're used to big highways and people who obey traffic signals."
But many Americans were also skeptical about Mr. Snowden's potential protector, President Rafael Correa, who will ultimately decide his asylum request and who recently signed a law that critics say restricts press freedom.
"It's just that he wants to put his finger in the eye of the U.S.," Mr. Lane said. "It's hypocritical."
As for Mr. Snowden's technological needs, the government has ambitions to make Ecuador a technology and science powerhouse. It plans to build a large research center called the City of Knowledge near Quito, the capital. But that is still years away.
In the 2013 Networked Readiness Index of the World Economic Forum, a measure of countries' development of the Internet and other technological capabilities, Ecuador ranked 91st out of 144 countries, although it was ahead of many of its South American neighbors, including Argentina, Bolivia and Venezuela (another country increasingly mentioned as a possible destination for Mr. Snowden).
Mr. Pedersen, the Web site designer, said that he takes frequent trips home to Denmark to immerse himself in technology culture, an option that presumably will not be available to Mr. Snowden. "He'd have to stay here forever, and that's not supercool," Mr. Pedersen said. After a moment, he added, "It's better than a U.S. jail, I guess."
Correction: July 6, 2013, Saturday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The Quito Journal article on Thursday, about Ecuador's emergence as a possible haven for Edward J. Snowden, the fugitive American who leaked intelligence information, misstated the size of Ecuador relative to the size of Texas. Ecuador is smaller than Texas, not "a little bit bigger." (Ecuador is closer to the size of Nevada.)

Full text:   FRANKFURT -- Unemployment in the euro zone continued its steady rise in May, according to data published Monday, underscoring the human effects of a financial downturn that has lasted a year and a half.
The jobless rate in the 17 countries that belong to the euro zone was 12.1 percent in May, adjusting for seasonal effects, according to a report from Eurostat, the European Union statistics agency. That figure compared with 12 percent in April, which was revised down from 12.2 percent reported earlier. Based on the revised figures, May unemployment was at a record high.
Eurostat estimated that 19.2 million people in the euro area were jobless in May, an increase of 67,000 from April. For all 27 countries in the European Union, the unemployment rate was unchanged at 10.9 percent. The European bloc expanded to 28 countries on Monday when Croatia officially joined.
Joblessness in the euro zone has been rising almost without interruption since early 2008, when the financial crisis began, declining only briefly at the beginning of 2011. And analysts see little prospect for a sustained decline anytime soon.
While economists expect the euro zone economy to stabilize in the course of this year, growth will most likely remain too slow to generate large numbers of jobs.
"The measure that offers the greatest potential for job creation in the short to medium term is an easing of credit conditions," Marie Diron, an economist who advises the consulting firm Ernst & Young, said in a statement. "This would allow companies to invest and as a result recruit in the euro zone."
The European Central Bank will hold its monetary policy meeting on Thursday, but it is not expected to introduce more stimulus to the euro zone economy. A cut in the benchmark rate, to 0.25 percent from a record 0.5 percent, is possible, but many say it would be unlikely to do much to encourage lending in troubled countries like Spain and Italy.
Banks in those countries are trying to cope with rising numbers of bad loans and are reluctant to lend no matter how cheaply they can borrow from the European Central Bank. And the central bank remains reluctant to effectively print more money, as the Federal Reserve in the United States and Bank of England have done, because of opposition from Germany to more aggressive action.
Eurostat also reported on Monday that inflation in the euro zone rose to 1.6 percent from 1.4 percent because of a surge in energy prices. While inflation remains below the central bank's target of about 2 percent, the uptick is likely to provide a further argument against increasing the benchmark interest rate.
Compounding the bank's challenge, the numbers released showed that there remained a big difference in economic performance among euro zone countries. These differences make it difficult for the central bank to form a monetary policy that is appropriate for all members.
Unemployment rates in Spain and Greece were about 27 percent in May, with youth unemployment remaining well above 50 percent. In contrast, unemployment in Austria was 4.7 percent and in Germany was 5.3 percent. Both had youth jobless rates below 9 percent.
If there was any good news, economists said, it was that unemployment may not go up much more. "An end to the euro zone labor market downturn is not yet imminent," Martin van Vliet, an economist at ING Bank, said in a note to investors. "However, with the recession across the euro zone petering out, the peak in unemployment should not be too far away, either."

Abstract: Mr. Colombo emerged from Roman Catholic youth organizations to win a seat in Parliament at 26 and then held virtually every major cabinet position -- agriculture, trade, finance, foreign affairs -- before he became prime minister for 18 months between 1970 and 1972. Mr. Colombo earned a law degree from the University of Rome and joined Catholic Action Youth, a Vatican-backed political organization, rising to vice president and gaining enough prominence to win a seat in Parliament in 1946.

Full text:   Emilio Colombo, the prime minister of Italy at the start of the 1970s who curbed roaring inflation, battled political extremism and legalized divorce in his country while helping to build an integrated Europe, died on June 24 in Rome. He was 93.
His office announced the death.
After World War II, Italian governments formed and fell with dizzying regularity, as did cabinet posts within the governments. Mr. Colombo emerged from Roman Catholic youth organizations to win a seat in Parliament at 26 and then held virtually every major cabinet position -- agriculture, trade, finance, foreign affairs -- before he became prime minister for 18 months between 1970 and 1972. The government he headed, centrist in its policies, was Italy's 32nd since the war.
Mr. Colombo helped write some of Italy's basic postwar reforms, including those that redistributed land to the poor, nationalized electricity production and spurred development in the nation's impoverished South.
A self-described technocrat, Mr. Colombo wrote much of the Treaty of Rome, which in 1958 established the European Economic Community, a precursor to the European Community and the European Union. Martin Schulz, president of the European Parliament, said in a statement that Mr. Colombo was "a key figure in Italian history and European integration."
As prime minister, Mr. Colombo, a member of the conservative Christian Democratic Party, juggled his and three other parties to form coalitions that would keep power from falling to the Communists, whose political strength in Italy exceeded that of any country in Western Europe. He also faced down the neo-Fascist right, survived waves of strikes and violence, and imposed new and higher taxes to successfully fight galloping inflation.
His foreign policy included establishing diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China and maintaining Italy's strong support for the United States.
Communists said the Central Intelligence Agency had interfered in Italian politics on behalf of the Christian Democrats. Mr. Colombo denied the accusation. But in his 2007 book, "Legacy of Ashes: The History of the CIA," Tim Weiner, a former reporter for The New York Times, quoted former C.I.A. employees in Rome as saying that they had indeed distributed $25 million to anti-Communist parties in Italy beginning in 1970.
Mr. Colombo's coalition collapsed in February 1972, partly over his signing, in 1970, of Italy's first law legitimizing divorce. Like the Vatican, his own Christian Democrats opposed the legislation, while leftist members of the coalition demanded it.
In 1974, the law survived an attempt at a repeal, with 59.3 percent voting to support it.
Emilio Colombo was born on April 11, 1920, to a lower middle-class family in Potenza, 100 miles southeast of Naples. A bishop in his home region persuaded him to go into politics. Many called him "Cardinal Colombo" because of his strong faith.
Mr. Colombo earned a law degree from the University of Rome and joined Catholic Action Youth, a Vatican-backed political organization, rising to vice president and gaining enough prominence to win a seat in Parliament in 1946. That year he was elected to a convention charged with writing a new republican constitution to replace Italy's monarchy. He was the last surviving member of that constitutional convention.
In 1948, after being re-elected to Parliament, Mr. Colombo was given his first leadership post, undersecretary of agriculture. He used the position to develop programs to help his native region in the South.
Mr. Colombo was twice foreign minister, in 1980-83 and 1992-93. In his first term, he was a strong backer of American plans to base medium-range ballistic missiles in Europe. A Soviet radio commentary said a long article he wrote on the subject sounded as if it had been written in Washington by the State Department.
Mr. Colombo was known for his total immersion in politics, which he considered "a priesthood," a Milan newspaper wrote in 1970. He wore dull ties and well-pressed suits, and his crispness of bearing prompted a friend to suggest that he needed only an umbrella to be British.
In 2003, just after being appointed a senator for life, Mr. Colombo disclosed that he had used cocaine three or four times a week for more than a year. He said that he had used the drug for "therapeutic purposes," and that he was making the admission to prevent his bodyguards from being prosecuted as his procurers. Consumption of cocaine in Italy is not a criminal offense, but trafficking is.
At the same time, Mr. Colombo also disclosed that he was homosexual. For years he had told interviewers that he was too busy to marry. Information on survivors was unavailable.
When Mr. Colombo visited the United States in 1971, an editorial in The Times praised his political agility, saying he had "surmounted more perils than Pauline."
His sense of humor surely helped. When meeting with Mayor John V. Lindsay, who was grappling with huge fiscal challenges in New York City, Mr. Colombo invited him to Rome if he wanted to see real problems.
"I believe this would be a great source of comfort for you," he said.

Abstract: The Fed itself announced Mr. Greenspan's decision to retire, and in late October 2005, President George W. Bush announced his choice of Mr. Bernanke at a White House news conference where he lavished praise on the departing chairman as a "legend" who had "dominated his age like no central banker in history" while Mr. Greenspan looked on.

Full text:   It can't have been the send-off that the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, was hoping for.
"He's already stayed a lot longer than he wanted or he was supposed to," President Obama told Charlie Rose in an interview that was broadcast on June 17 on Bloomberg TV, all but confirming that he wouldn't reappoint Mr. Bernanke when his term expires at the end of this year.
The best the president could muster was that Mr. Bernanke was an "outstanding partner along with the White House" in warding off "what could have been an economic crisis of epic proportions."
A White House spokesman said Mr. Obama meant that as praise, but supporters of the chairman, and even many who have disagreed with him on policy issues, were quick to question both the timing and substance of the comment.
Not only did the comment come across as faint praise for a long-serving public servant who guided the nation's monetary policy through a severe crisis, but its timing could also hardly have been worse. Mr. Bernanke was in the midst of important Federal Open Market Committee meetings and that very week began the delicate task of communicating the Fed's plans to "taper" its latest round of quantitative easing. Markets went into convulsions and interest rates shot up. While no one blames Mr. Obama for that, adding another element of uncertainty about Fed policy may have contributed to the volatility.
Others were critical of the president's choice of the word "partner" to describe the Fed chairman's role, since the Federal Reserve is an independent agency overseen by Congress. "Any Fed chairman would bristle at the idea they were a partner with a president," Senator Bob Corker, the Tennessee Republican who serves on the Senate Banking subcommittee on financial institutions and consumer protection, told me this week. "I can understand why people who want to protect the independence of the Fed would be concerned."
Others pointed out that the Fed has taken the lead in efforts to stimulate the economy as Congress blocked the White House from further stimulus measures, and thus "partner" overstates the White House's role in the recovery.
By contrast, although history hasn't been kind to the legacy of Mr. Bernanke's predecessor, Alan Greenspan, he received a send-off commensurate with his record five terms of service. The Fed itself announced Mr. Greenspan's decision to retire, and in late October 2005, President George W. Bush announced his choice of Mr. Bernanke at a White House news conference where he lavished praise on the departing chairman as a "legend" who had "dominated his age like no central banker in history" while Mr. Greenspan looked on. On the same occasion, Mr. Bernanke said Mr. Greenspan "set the standard for excellence in economic policy making."
With many economists and investors fixated for months on the question of when and how quickly the Fed would curtail its extraordinary efforts to stimulate the economy, Mr. Bernanke's suggestion, just two days after the president's comments, that the Fed might taper its bond-buying earlier than expected sent markets reeling. Stocks fell across the globe and interest rates rose, with 10-year Treasuries hitting their highest yields since 2011. The volatility index, which was already rising the week before the president's remarks, leapt to a new high for the year.
Mr. Obama "instantly made Ben a lame duck before the end of his term," said one economist, who may be a future candidate for Mr. Bernanke's position and, like many people I interviewed, asked not to be named. "He undermined his credibility both inside the Fed and in financial markets." While Mr. Bernanke tried to reassure markets that the Fed would monitor the economy and respond as appropriate, this person said, "Part of the negative reaction in asset prices was because market participants have confidence in Ben, but now he won't be around to oversee that."
People close to Mr. Bernanke told me that the chairman took the president's comments in stride, but said he was concerned about the severe market reaction. "He wouldn't want to feed stories about this when he's trying to articulate a complex message about monetary policy," one adviser said.
The people close to the chairman said he had already told the president he wanted to leave at the end of his term. He is expected to return to teaching and research at Princeton, where he delivered this year's baccalaureate address. He quipped in the speech that his remarks had "nothing whatsoever to do with interest rates" and observed that life was unpredictable.
Senator Corker, who as an advocate for price stability is seen as more hawkish on monetary policy than Mr. Bernanke, said he had breakfast with Mr. Bernanke a few weeks ago. "I couldn't imagine him wanting to be reappointed," the senator said. "He's never confided in me, but I've never gotten the sense that he wanted to serve beyond this term." Others close to Mr. Bernanke agreed with that assessment, but added that if asked by the president to do so, he would stay.
Through a spokeswoman, Mr. Bernanke declined to comment. When asked at his news conference last week about the president's remarks, Mr. Bernanke responded coolly: "We just spent two days working on monetary policy issues, and I would like to keep the debate, discussion, the questions here on policy. I don't have anything for you on my personal plans."
But underscoring the perception that Mr. Bernanke is now a lame duck, two senior officials -- William C. Dudley, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and Jerome H. Powell, a Fed governor -- tried to reassure investors and calm markets this week. "Market adjustments since May have been larger than would be justified by any reasonable reassessment of the path of policy," Mr. Powell said in a speech on Thursday.
Others told me the president's remarks needed to be put in the broader perspective of Fed policy. "I certainly agree that you don't want to add uncertainty at a time like this," said Jim O'Sullivan, chief United States economist for High Frequency Economics, an independent research firm. "It would have been better not to have those comments as a news item. But it's not the main factor causing the market turmoil. You can't really blame the surge in bond yields on that comment. Arguably, the markets overreacted, but markets do overreact."
The president "has to pull off a delicate balancing act," said Douglas J. Elliott, a fellow at the Brookings Institution. "You don't want to undercut the Fed chairman by making it more obvious than it is that he's a lame duck. But he is. It's not out of the question that he would choose to stay on, but it seems extremely unlikely. Most market participants already knew that."
Everyone I spoke to agreed that President Obama was likely to appoint someone more "dovish" on monetary policy than Mr. Bernanke -- that is, someone who favors an easy monetary policy to raise employment and worries less about inflation. That would seemingly include the Fed vice chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, widely viewed as the front-runner to succeed Mr. Bernanke. Paradoxically, the market reacted to the president's remarks as if both Mr. Bernanke and his likely successor had become more hawkish, and thus more inclined to raise rates.
"If people were really worried that the new Fed chairman is likely to be more dovish -- and the current favorite has that reputation -- you'd think they'd be snapping up inflation hedges," Mr. O'Sullivan said. "But they're not. Real yields are going up. The markets don't seem to be too worried about a dovish Fed."
Market reactions aside, the end of the Bernanke era at the Fed seems to be approaching. He has his critics on both the right and left, but everyone I spoke to praised Mr. Bernanke's record. "I thought he handled himself very well during the crisis, and for that I have a lot of respect for him," Senator Corker said. "I understand what he was trying to do with quantitative easing, and although we've had some policy differences, I think he's handled that in a very artful and effective way."
Still, as the end of the year nears, "He'll become less and less relevant, and the trade is only halfway done," the senator added. "The new Fed chairman has to unload the huge portfolio that they have," and Mr. Bernanke's "successor has to be someone who has the ability to handle these complexities in a very delicate and thoughtful way."

Abstract: Losses for bond holders are sure to happen at some point, assuming interest rates return to more normal levels, and this week's downward revision of first-quarter economic growth may provide a warning that the Fed's growth expectations, which are more robust than those of many economists, may be too rosy.

Full text:   ON the day after Democrats lost control of the House of Representatives in the 2010 midterm election, the Federal Reserve announced it would purchase $600 billion in Treasury securities -- a program that quickly became known as Q.E.2, for quantitative easing.
While the first such program started at the height of the credit crisis in 2008, the new program came when the economy was growing, and it was subjected to immediate and withering criticism, particularly from conservatives fearful it would set off inflation and unimpressed by the Fed's belief that action was needed to spur job growth.
A group of 43 economists, including former aides to Republican presidents and presidential candidates, published an open letter to the Fed's chairman, Ben Bernanke, saying the program should be "reconsidered and discontinued." The planned bond purchases "risk currency debasement and inflation, and we do not think they will achieve the Fed's objective of promoting employment," the economists wrote.
The Fed did not back down, and Republican efforts to pass legislation removing the Fed's mandate to seek full employment were not successful. The next year, the Fed moved on to what became known as Q.E.3, also known as Operation Twist, an effort to bring down long-term interest rates by purchasing longer-term Treasuries. That move was criticized by Republican leaders even before it was announced. "We have serious concerns that further intervention by the Federal Reserve could exacerbate current problems or further harm the U.S. economy," the Congressional leadership said in a letter sent to Mr. Bernanke while the Fed was meeting.
Now, the Fed is again under attack, as officials discuss the possibility of slowing the pace of bond purchases later this year, and of possibly ending the program as early as 2014. That talk has caused interest rates to rise and led to warnings of large losses for bond investors, amid complaints that it is still too early to proclaim that the recovery has gathered strength.
Losses for bond holders are sure to happen at some point, assuming interest rates return to more normal levels, and this week's downward revision of first-quarter economic growth may provide a warning that the Fed's growth expectations, which are more robust than those of many economists, may be too rosy. Navigating an end to quantitative easing, whenever that becomes necessary, may yet prove to be tricky.
But as the accompanying charts indicate, the Fed's critics of 2010 and 2011 have not proved to be prescient. Far from bringing disaster, Q.E.2 appears to have helped the economy.
It is remarkable how close many markets are now to where they were when the Fed announced the program on Nov. 3, 2010. The recent rise in 10-year Treasury bond rates has left the yield just a little lower than when the program began. The price of gold spiked to record highs in 2011 but is now down about 8 percent from its pre-Q.E.2 level.
In 2010, there were complaints from developing countries that the Fed was trying to drive down the value of the dollar, something Fed officials denied while conceding that the program could temporarily have that effect. Now the dollar index -- based on the value of the American currency against six foreign currencies -- has recovered all the lost ground.
Inflation has been quiet, and perhaps more important from a central bank perspective, inflationary expectations remain subdued. Such expectations can be inferred by comparing yields of inflation-protected Treasury securities to ordinary Treasuries of the same maturity. The chart shows what the markets expect inflation will be in five years.
For a time last year, the markets were expecting deflation -- a far cry from the runaway inflation feared by Fed critics in 2010. Now, the expectation is for inflation of a little over 1 percent -- or less than the expectation when the Q.E.2 program was begun.
The decline in unemployment since the Fed began Q.E.2 has been steady but hardly inspiring, and there are still fewer people working than there were before the credit crisis began in 2008. But consumer confidence has been rising recently and the stock market, despite some recent Fed-induced jitters, remains more than 30 percent above its level when the program began.

Full text:   BEIRUT, Lebanon -- A suicide bombing and at least two other attacks hit the Christian quarter of the historic Old City in Damascus on Thursday, underscoring the Syrian civil war's violent reach into relatively secure parts of the capital even as President Bashar al-Assad says his side is winning.
Syria's official news agency and witnesses reached by telephone said at least four people were killed in the bombing, which targeted a medical charity treating patients in the Bab Touma neighborhood. Witnesses said the other attacks were caused by shells or mortar explosions, including one that hit a restaurant, but it was unclear whether they were fired by insurgents or Assad loyalists.
One resident, who identified himself as Ammar, said the streets of the Old City were deserted after the attacks, which he called the worst to hit the area, a Unesco World Heritage site, since the Syrian conflict began more than two years ago.
Mr. Assad and his aides have asserted that the momentum of the conflict has turned in their favor since the Syrian military, aided by fighters from the Lebanese Shiite militant organization Hezbollah, routed rebel forces from the town of Qusayr near the Lebanon border this month. But the ravaging effects of the conflict have worsened.
On Wednesday, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an anti-Assad group based in Britain that relies on a network of contacts inside Syria, said its tallies showed that more than 100,000 people had died since the conflict began, a third of them civilians.
On Thursday, the International Committee of the Red Cross said that it was projecting an extended conflict in Syria as it became more militarized, with no end in sight. The group's president, Peter Maurer, told reporters at a news conference at the organization's Geneva headquarters that the mayhem in Syria had caused "unprecedented suffering and generated needs that aid organizations were often unable to respond to because of the fighting."
The conflict and the Western sanctions imposed on Syria have caused a near economic collapse in the country, and the official currency, the Syrian pound, has plummeted in value against the dollar and the euro. Last week Mr. Assad's government ordered double-digit increases in salaries for public employees and retirees to help offset the pound's diminished worth, which is almost certain to cause sharply higher inflation in Syria.
But in a sign that the Syrian leadership does not seem overly concerned about a financial crisis, a senior economics official said in an interview with The Financial Times, published on its Web site Thursday, that Iran, Russia and China were helping to prop up the Syrian economy, delivering $500 million a month worth of oil and extending generous credit lines.
The official, Qadri Jamil, deputy prime minister for the economy, was quoted as saying that the Syrian government was now doing all of its business in Iranian rials, Russian rubles and Chinese renminbi, and that the three economic allies would soon help with a "counteroffensive" against what he called a foreign plot to destroy the Syrian pound's value.
"It's not that bad to have behind you the Russians, the Chinese and Iranians," Mr. Jamil was quoted as saying.
At the United Nations on Thursday, the Security Council authorized a six-month extension of the multinational peacekeeping force that has patrolled the disputed Golan Heights area straddling Syria and Israel, which has been destabilized in recent months in a spillover of the Syrian conflict.
In an unusual moment of unanimity on Syria, the Security Council resolution, introduced by the United States and Russia, also said that members of the force should be given more powerful weapons and gear to protect themselves.
Sir Mark Lyall Grant, the British ambassador who has been the Security Council president for the month of June, told reporters that peacekeeping force soldiers, who carry only sidearms, would be getting body armor and "heavier weapons to protect themselves."

Full text:   The economy is the victim of a little misunderstanding, Federal Reserve officials said on Thursday, telling investors who have sent borrowing costs soaring that they are misguided in believing the Fed's stimulus campaign is about to wane.
The message, delivered in three separate but similar speeches, reflects the Fed's frustration with a broad rise in interest rates that began in May and accelerated after remarks last week by the Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke.
"I don't want to be too cute about a serious matter," Dennis P. Lockhart, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, said in Marietta, Ga., "but to make an analogy, it seems to me the chairman said we'll use the patch -- and use it flexibly -- and some in the markets reacted as if he said 'cold turkey.' "
The speeches, including one by William C. Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and one of Mr. Bernanke's closest allies, appeared to make an impression, helped along by upbeat domestic economic data and an easing of concerns about Chinese financial conditions. Stocks rose modestly, ending up for the third day in a row, while interest rates ticked downward, inverting the recent pattern.
On Wall Street, the broad Standard & Poor's 500-stock index had risen for most of the first five months of the year, bringing it to a high of 1,669.16 on May 21. But the next day, after Mr. Bernanke first hinted at an impending change in Fed policy, stock prices began falling, and the S.& P. 500 eventually dropped 5.7 percent to a low on June 24, a few days after the most recent Fed policy statement. Since then, as Fed officials have sought to clarify their goals, the index has risen 2.5 percent, including Thursday's 0.6 percent increase.
On Thursday, the three officials emphasized that the Fed was increasingly optimistic about the durability of economic growth. And they reiterated that they expected to reduce the volume of the Fed's monthly bond purchases later this year. But the Fed's overall effort to reduce borrowing costs will continue as long as necessary, most likely for years to come.
Investors, they said, need to gently place interest rates back down on the floor.
"Market adjustments since May have been larger than would be justified by any reasonable reassessment of the path of policy," said the Fed governor Jerome H. Powell.
Mr. Dudley, who is also the vice chairman of the Fed's policy-making committee, was even more emphatic. Investors expecting an early exit are "quite out of sync" with the Fed, he said. "A rise in short-term rates is very likely to be a long way off."
The Fed is struggling in a world of its own creation. The central bank, seeking new ways to stimulate the economy, has sought to manage investor expectations about the path of monetary policy. By convincing investors that it will keep interest rates low tomorrow, it can reduce borrowing costs today.
In essence, the Fed is asking investors to stake vast sums on the proposition that it will do what it says. And investors, unsurprisingly, have become increasingly fearful about any sign that the Fed may change its plans.
The mainstay of the Fed's stimulus campaign is its stated intention to hold short-term interest rates near zero as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6.5 percent. It has put further pressure on longer-term rates by amassing more than $3 trillion in Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities; since last December it has expanded those holdings by an additional $85 billion a month in a process known as quantitative easing, or Q.E.
Interest rates started rising in May after Mr. Bernanke suggested that the Fed might reduce the volume of its monthly purchases later this year. Rates rose much more quickly after he said last week that the Fed was planning to do exactly that.
Mr. Bernanke insisted that the Fed was not altering its plans for short-term rates. He said the Fed was not even altering its plans for asset purchases; it was just publicizing those plans for the first time. And he emphasized that the timetable would change if the economy grew more slowly than expected.
But investors "seem to believe that Fed officials must have become at least somewhat more willing to consider earlier hikes if they are sufficiently comfortable with the economic outlook to preannounce Q.E. tapering," wrote Jan Hatzius, chief economist at Goldman Sachs.
Wells Fargo, the nation's largest mortgage lender, has raised its standard interest rate on 30-year loans to 4.625 percent, from 3.9 percent. Yields on corporate junk bonds have jumped two percentage points in less than two months.
Perhaps most strikingly, market pricing has shifted to reflect an expectation that the Fed will begin to raise short-term rates by the end of 2014, despite the fact that 15 of 19 Fed officials indicated last week they did not expect an increase until 2015.
Investors are skeptical partly because the Fed has repeatedly overestimated the pace of growth in recent years. If it repeats the mistake, it could once again end up withdrawing stimulus prematurely. Moreover, the Fed has emphasized the unemployment rate as its measuring stick. That rate has declined largely because many jobless people have stopped looking for work, raising concerns that the Fed could meet its stated goals and begin to retreat while the economy remained relatively weak.
"The chairman often talks of the misery inflicted by sustained high unemployment, but he has set the Fed on a course to stop asset purchases at a point when about five million people are likely to be missing from the labor force, compared to 2007," wrote Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. "Even allowing for policy lags, that seems startlingly unambitious."
Mr. Dudley sought to counter these concerns by emphasizing that the Fed would adjust its efforts as necessary, and by offering a detailed account of his own reasons for increased economic optimism. "I see persuasive evidence of improved underlying fundamentals for much of the private sector of the U.S. economy," he said, citing lower levels of household debt and increased lending.
Mr. Powell spoke of "many signs that the economy is healing."
Mr. Lockhart was more measured in his economic forecast. The government said on Thursday that prices continued to rise in May at the slowest pace in at least half a century, up just 1.1 percent over the previous year -- well below the 2 percent annual pace that the Fed considers most healthy.
Mr. Lockhart, like most Fed officials, said he expected that inflation would gradually return to a healthier pace, partly because of the Fed's existing plans for continuing stimulus, partly because expectations remained well anchored and partly because officials had concluded that the measurements were understating inflation for technical and temporary reasons.
But he noted that the sluggish pace of inflation could also be an indication of economic weakness.
"It's possible," he said, "these low inflation readings indicate an economy that is weaker than I, for one, believe it is."

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Americans spent more in May as their income rose, encouraging signs after a slow start to the year.
The Commerce Department said on Thursday that consumer spending rose 0.3 percent last month, nearly erasing a decline of similar size in April. Income rose 0.5 percent.
Consumers, benefiting from low inflation, spent more at retail businesses in May, notably for cars, home improvements and sporting goods.
The number of people who signed contracts to buy homes in the United States jumped in May to the highest level in more than six years, a sign home sales will probably rise in the months ahead.
The National Association of Realtors said on Thursday that its seasonally adjusted index for pending home sales rose 6.7 percent, to 112.3, last month, the highest level since December 2006. Signed contracts have risen 12.1 percent in the last 12 months.
The increase could reflect an effort by potential buyers to complete deals before mortgage rates rise further. Mortgage rates rose in May and then jumped after the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, suggested last week that the Fed could slow its bond purchases later this year.
The increase points to healthy gains in home sales in the coming months. There is generally a one- to two-month lag between a signed contract and a completed sale.
The average rate on a 30-year mortgage soared this week to 4.46 percent, the highest in nearly two years.

Full text:   Is Ben Bernanke being too chatty?
That's the question being put forward by some economists and others about Mr. Bernanke, the normally restrained Federal Reserve chairman, after his comments in May and last week about the economy and the central bank's plans for eventually backing off its stimulus measures.
Last week, his comments that the economic recovery was surpassing forecasts sent the market into a tailspin because Wall Street was worried that the Fed would start easing its bond-buying program and raise interest rates sooner than many had anticipated. That, in turn, could slow the economy, some worry. Since then, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has fallen nearly 5 percent.
Mr. Bernanke, hardly one to be described as verbose, said far more during his news conference on Wednesday than he usually does -- and he went further about the Fed's policy plans than the committee itself had said earlier in its official statement.
He went so far that one of the Fed's directors, James B. Bullard, publicly questioned the board's decision to let Mr. Bernanke expound upon its thinking. In a statement, Mr. Bullard said he "felt that the committee's decision to authorize the chairman to lay out a more elaborate plan for reducing the pace of asset purchases was inappropriately timed."
He went on to say that "a more prudent approach would be to wait for more tangible signs that the economy was strengthening and that inflation was on a path to return toward target before making such an announcement."
It wasn't that long ago that any Fed chairman hardly said a word. Until 1994, the Fed did not even regularly issue a statement disclosing a change in policy after its monthly meeting. Alan Greenspan made an art out of talking in circles so that investors couldn't divine his intentions.
Janet Yellen, the Fed's vice chairwoman and a possible successor to Mr. Bernanke, explained in a recent speech that for most of the last century, the Fed's communications policy was modeled on Montagu Norman, governor of the Bank of England, whose motto, she said, was, "Never explain, never excuse."
Ever since the financial crisis, with calls for more transparency, Mr. Bernanke has taken a different tack, holding news conferences and providing specific details and timelines for the Fed's policies.
In some instances, it has worked magnificently. By laying out a timetable for the Fed's stimulus back in January 2012 -- in which he explained the Fed's inflation and unemployment targets -- he found a way to create a relative calm in the markets.
Questions about the communications strategy, however, were raised about whether he was oversharing. Would it become, as they might say on Twitter, T.M.I.? (Too Much Information.) The worry back then was that he would box himself into a specific timeline and that he would have a tricky time exiting his stimulus strategy.
Even before Mr. Bernanke spoke last week, he was being blamed for the recent market volatility. "The purpose of central-bank transparency was to give markets clarity and reduce volatility," Ed Yardeni, president and chief investment strategist at Yardeni Research, told Bloomberg News two days before the Bernanke news conference.
"Instead, it's increasing volatility and been counterproductive. Clearly the backup in bond yields and sell-off are disconcerting."
In a perfect world, the Fed's communications strategy should mean the markets are less erratic, not more.
However, with investors hanging on every syllable of every word that comes out of the mouths of Mr. Bernanke and the other board members, volatility seems to have been worse.
In fairness, everything is relative, so it is possible that the markets would act even more erratically if the communications policy was less straightforward. It is impossible to know. It's the ultimate Catch-22.
During Mr. Bernanke's news conference, he was asked whether his comments went beyond what the committee had agreed on.
"There's no change in policy involved here. There's simply a clarification, helping people to think about where policy will evolve. So, it was thought that it might be best for me to explain that to this group," Mr. Bernanke told reporters.
And yet, his words moved the market because they filled in gaps that a statement from the Fed could never fully communicate.
Ms. Yellen, in her speech, which was given to the Society of American Business Editors and Writers, said that the Fed's move to be more transparent wasn't just for the sake of transparency. She said the Fed's utterances had become an important tool.
The first big communications moment for the Fed, she said, was in 2003 when the central bank was running out of options to spur growth because it had already cut the federal funds rate. So it decided to tell the market that it planned to keep rates low for a considerable period.
"The committee was using communication -- mere words -- as its primary monetary policy tool. Until then, it was probably common to think of communication about future policy as something that supplemented the setting of the federal funds rate. In this case, communication was an independent and effective tool for influencing the economy," she said.
Communication is indeed influencing the markets now. Whether it is too much of a good thing will only truly become apparent down the road.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text:   MEXICO CITY -- Andrés Granier has a sumptuous wardrobe and lifestyle. He has bragged about owning 400 pairs of shoes, 300 suits and 1,000 shirts, collected from luxury stores in New York and Los Angeles. His purchases barely fit in his several properties, scattered throughout Mexico and abroad.
A tape recording of Mr. Granier's boasts, making him sound like a highflying corporate executive, was leaked to a local radio station last month. But his job title, until December, was governor of a midsize southeastern Mexican state, a position that currently pays about $92,000 a year after taxes.
"We go to Fifth Avenue and buy a pair of shoes; $600," Mr. Granier is heard saying about one of his trips abroad. "I took clothes to Miami, I took clothes to Cancún, I took clothes to my house, and I have leftovers," he added, saying, "I'm going to auction them off." (The day after the recording was made public, he said that he had been inebriated while making those statements in October.)
But just as eye-opening as the extravagances of a public official -- now under investigation after Mr. Granier's successor discovered that about $190 million in state funds was unaccounted for, the state government said this month -- is that they came to light at all in a country where state and local corruption, a serious drag on Mexico's development, run deep and are rarely exposed.
The case of Mr. Granier, who was taken into custody on June 14 at a Mexico City hospital where he is being treated for a heart ailment, is just the latest among several former governors and public officials who have recently found themselves under investigation or facing public scorn.
Watchdog groups are gaining strength, opposition parties are challenging and exposing the faults of the status quo, and social and traditional news media organizations are increasingly seeking to hold officials accountable.
"There will be more of these because the issue has taken off," said Ricardo Corona, a public finance expert at the Mexican Institute for Competitiveness, a research group in Mexico City. "There is encouragement on the issues of transparency, accountability, access to information."
Mr. Granier's case is one of the more closely followed political spectacles here in recent years.
By January, when the new government in his state, Tabasco, found holes in the budget, Mr. Granier, 65, had retreated into obscurity. This month, after public shock and outrage over the recording reached a fever pitch, he suddenly resurfaced on television, saying he was in Miami.
"I'm going back to Mexico," he declared in an interview on one of Mexico's most-watched morning shows, Primero Noticias. "I don't owe absolutely anything."
Upon his arrival at the airport in the capital the following day, a chaotic news media swarm engulfed Mr. Granier -- at one point he stumbled before the cameras -- before he was whisked away in a white S.U.V., with camera crews on motorcycles giving chase.
Three days later, the Tabasco state attorney's office issued an arraignment order for Mr. Granier on suspicion of embezzlement and improper exercise of public service.
His treasurer, José Manuel Saiz, already had been arrested this month on suspicion of embezzlement as he tried to cross the border into the United States, after boxes containing nearly $7 million in unexplained cash were discovered on a property linked to him.
A decade ago, such suspicious accounting would have most likely been kept under wraps, as Mexican officials tended to protect one another and the public took their malfeasance for granted. During the uninterrupted 71-year rule of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, governors, who often secured their appointments based on friendly ties with the autocratic presidents, were almost expected to pillage state treasuries.
When the party lost the 2000 presidential election, it left a political vacuum across the states. Governors around the country acquired unprecedented autonomy and almost no oversight, said Alfonso Zárate, the president of Grupo Consultor Interdisciplinario, a political consulting firm in Mexico.
State debt rose to $30 billion in 2012 from about $15 billion in 2008, according to the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit. Accounting for inflation, that was a 70.4 percent increase, according to an article in the online publication Animal Político by Marco Cancino, a political analyst in Mexico City. Governments have reported scant details of how they have spent the money from these loans.
But with governors from opposing political parties succeeding one another and doing away with the unspoken pact of the PRI years, in which incoming leaders protected departing ones, a system of checks and balances -- some have called it political retribution -- is emerging.
Freedom of information laws, recent legislative overhauls demanding more accountability from state governments and an increasingly technologically engaged society have been more successful at preventing murky finances from going unquestioned.
As a result, tales of disgraced former governors are becoming a staple of the news here, and are part of what Mr. Zárate calls an "incipient democracy."
In 2011, the federal attorney general's office opened an investigation into a $3 billion debt in the state of Coahuila, acquired mostly during the administration of Humberto Moreira, a former president of the PRI, which recovered the presidency in December. The former governor of the state of Aguascalientes, Luis Armando Reynoso, is being investigated over improper exercise of public service, news organizations have reported.
Last year, Mario Ernesto Villanueva Madrid, the former governor of the state of Quintana Roo who was extradited to the United States in 2010, pleaded guilty to conspiring to launder millions of dollars in bribes he received from the powerful Juárez drug organization, to ensure that its cocaine moved safely through his state, undisturbed by law enforcement.
Inroads in transparency, however, have yet to change the culture and mentality of "El que no tranza, no avanza," or "He who does not cheat, does not get ahead," a popular motto here. And these victories have yet to transform the country's image abroad: Mexico fell in Transparency International's corruption perception index to 105th place in 2012 from 57th in 2002, with a lower ranking indicating that the country is seen as more corrupt.
"We still don't have accountability," said Mr. Cancino, the political analyst, who warned that progress in transparency practices at the federal level would slowly make their way down to the local and state levels. "There are still 32 battles that we have to wage," he said, referring to Mexico's 31 states and one federal district.
Small gains in transparency, seen through scandals like the one enveloping Mr. Granier, have not translated into justice served, experts say. Governors are investigated but rarely charged.
"We know what is going on," said Sergio Aguayo, a political analyst at the Colegio de México. "But no measures are being taken."
Mexicans who are active on Twitter discuss these scandals for days and sometimes weeks, shaming politicians and pressing traditional news media to cover them extensively. But political analysts argue that there are no effective mechanisms yet to translate citizen participation into structural change.
"What do we do so that society goes from indignation to action?" Mr. Cancino asked.
In the meantime, former politicians who endure public scrutiny and a dose of humiliation often come out of these scandals largely unscathed. In April, the newspaper Reforma reported that Mr. Moreira, the repudiated former Coahuila governor, was living with his family in an upscale neighborhood in Barcelona, Spain, while attending a local university.

Full text:   For the most part, Ben Bernanke and his colleagues at the Federal Reserve have been good guys in these troubled economic times. They have tried to boost the economy even as most of Washington seemingly either forgot about the jobless, or decided that the best way to cure unemployment was to intensify the suffering of the unemployed. You can argue -- and I would -- that the Fed's activism, while welcome, isn't enough, and that it should be doing even more. But at least it didn't lose sight of what's really important.
Until now.
Lately, Fed officials have been issuing increasingly strong hints that rather than doing more, they want to do less, that they are eager to start "tapering," returning to normal monetary policy. The impression that the Fed is tired of trying so hard got even stronger last week, after a news conference in which Mr. Bernanke seemed quite happy to reinforce the message of an imminent reduction in stimulus.
The trouble is that this is very much the wrong signal to be sending given the state of the economy. We're still very much living through what amounts to a low-grade depression -- and the Fed's bad messaging reduces the chances that we're going to exit that depression any time soon.
The first thing you need to understand is how far we remain from full employment four years after the official end of the 2007-9 recession. It's true that measured unemployment is down -- but that mainly reflects a decline in the number of people actively seeking jobs, rather than an increase in job availability. Look, for example, at the fraction of adults in their prime working years (25 to 54) who have jobs; that ratio fell from 80 to 75 percent in the recession, and has since recovered only to 76 percent.
Given this grim reality -- plus very low inflation -- you have to wonder why the Fed is talking at all about reducing its efforts on the economy's behalf.
Still, it's just talk, right? Well, yes -- but what the Fed says often matters as much as or more than what it does. This is inherent in the relationship between what the Fed more or less directly controls, namely short-term interest rates, and longer-term rates, which reflect expected as well as current short-term rates. Even if the Fed leaves short rates unchanged for now, statements that convince investors that these rates will be going up sooner rather than later will cause long rates to rise. And because long rates are what mainly matter for private spending, this will weaken growth and employment.
Sure enough, rates have shot up since the tapering talk started. Two months ago the benchmark interest rate on 10-year U.S. government bonds was only 1.7 percent, close to a historic low. Since then the rate has risen to 2.4 percent -- still low by normal standards, but, as I said, this isn't a normal economy. Maybe the economic recovery will, as the Fed predicts, continue and strengthen despite that increase in rates. But maybe not, and in any case higher rates will surely mean a slower recovery than we would have had if Fed officials had avoided all that talk of tapering.
Fed officials surely understand all of this. So what do they think they're doing?
One answer might be that the Fed has quietly come to agree with critics who argue that its easy-money policies are having damaging side-effects, say by increasing the risk of bubbles. But I hope that's not true, since whatever damage low rates may do is trivial compared with the damage higher rates, and the resulting rise in unemployment, would inflict.
In any case, my guess is that what's really happening is a bit different: Fed officials are, consciously or not, responding to political pressure. After all, ever since the Fed began its policy of aggressive monetary stimulus, it has faced angry accusations from the right that it is "debasing" the dollar and setting the stage for high inflation -- accusations that haven't been retracted even though the dollar has remained strong and inflation has remained low. It's hard to avoid the suspicion that Fed officials, worn down by the constant attacks, have been looking for a reason to slacken their efforts, and have seized on slightly better economic news as an excuse.
And maybe they'll get away with it; maybe the economic recovery will strengthen and all will be well. But rising interest rates make that happy outcome less likely. And now that everyone knows that the Fed is eager to slacken off, it will be hard to get interest rates back down to where they were.
It's sad and depressing, in both senses of the word. The fundamental reason our economy is still depressed after all these years is that so many policy makers lost the thread, forgetting that job creation was their most urgent task. Until now the Fed was an exception; but now it seems to be joining the club. Et tu, Ben?

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- On Thursday afternoon, staff members at the Farm Bureau, the country's largest agriculture trade group, were putting the final touches on a news release congratulating House members for passing a farm bill. But as more and more members cast their votes, the trade group realized that the bill was going to go down in defeat.
The failure of the House to pass a new five-year farm bill has blindsided the agriculture industry. The leaders of several trade groups said they had waited nearly three years for a farm bill and had been disappointed as the legislation was held up by partisan politics.
Many farm programs, including direct payments and crop insurance, will remain in place through Sept. 30, thanks to an extension measure passed by Congress to avoid the "fiscal cliff" this year. But several farmers, ranchers and dairy producers said that the failure of the farm bill had left them unable to plan as the planting season approached and that some programs, like disaster assistance for livestock producers, remained unfinanced.
"The biggest thing is that it creates uncertainty, the one thing you can't have in this business," said Danny Murphy, a soybean farmer from Canton, Miss., who is the president of the American Soybean Association. "The lack of a farm bill makes it hard for us to get loans or buy equipment because we don't know what price support programs we are going to be operating under. Banks don't like that."
Mr. Murphy said that most support and subsidy programs for corn, soybeans and other crops -- which provide credit to farmers, subsidies for water conservation and crop insurance -- run though the end of 2013, even after the extension expires, because farm programs are financed through a crop year, not on fiscal years. "But we want something done," he said. "They can't keep kicking this can down the road."
Some industries face a more immediate effect from the defeat of the bill. Producers of cattle and other livestock will have to go almost another year without a disaster insurance program that helps them after droughts and other weather-related disasters. That program expired in 2011.
Last year, during the worst drought in 50 years, producers were forced to kill thousands of cows and other livestock as hay and water supplies dwindled. In the meantime, feed costs skyrocketed. The House and Senate farm bills would have restored financing for the disaster relief program.
Livestock producers say they face an uncertain future. "This is really a defeat for us, since we were counting on Congress doing something to help the thousands of cattle producers who suffered from the drought," said Cristina Llorens, the executive director of legislative affairs at the National Beef Cattlemen's Association.
Ms. Llorens said 70 percent of cattle producers were affected by the drought. "It's really had a devastating effect on our industry," she said. "Our herds are the smallest since World War II. It's going to take us years to rebuild."
Milk producers say their situation is less dire, but the inability of Congress to pass a farm bill could have an effect on the industry if the current farm law is not extended past Sept. 30.
Chris Galen, a spokesman for the National Milk Producers Federation, which represents more than 32,000 dairy farmers, said the first program to go would be the Milk Income Loss Contract Program, which compensates dairy producers when domestic milk prices fall below a specified level. Mr. Galen said the industry did not expect to receive payments under the program this year because prices had been stable. "But it's still a few months before the end of the fiscal year, so you just don't know," he said.
Mr. Galen said that a big worry for milk producers was that Congress would allow the current farm law to expire after September, which would cause farm programs to follow an antiquated 1949 law that forces Washington to buy milk at wildly inflated prices, creating higher prices for dairy products. Because of adjustments for inflation and other technical formulas, the government would be forced by law to buy milk at about twice the current market prices to maintain a stable market.
"That would be really bad for us and our customers," Mr. Galen said.

Full text:   THE Dow Jones industrial average has nose-dived more than 500 points, or over 3 percent, since the Federal Reserve chairman Ben S. Bernanke's somewhat upbeat, if ambiguous, statement on the economy on Wednesday. Hurrah!
Many interpreted his remarks -- which followed a two-day meeting of the Fed's policy-making committee and which noted, among other things, that the Fed expected the unemployment rate to decline to around 7 percent next summer, from its current perch of 7.6 percent -- as signaling the beginning of the end for the controversial program known as quantitative easing, or Q.E., now in its third round. That program, in which the Fed has purchased tens of billions of dollars of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities a month, has kept interest rates at rock bottom since 2008, and helped propel stock and bond prices to their recent heights.
But since Mr. Bernanke's remarks, the dominant market sentiment hasn't been euphoria, but fear.
What happened to change the mood so dramatically, so quickly? Is the panic selling justified -- or is it just the first glimmer of hope that the Fed will finally take the metaphorical morphine drip out of the arm of the capital markets and allow the forces of supply and demand to set long-term interest rates?
Before answering those questions, it might be useful to review what exactly Mr. Bernanke said. First, he said that there should be no immediate change to the stimulus program. He said the economy looked as if it was slowly improving, that Fed officials saw signs that employment was picking up and that the inflation rate was hovering below the Fed's target of 2 percent.
Good news, right? He said that if these encouraging economic trends continued, then it might be appropriate to begin easing up a bit on the Fed's $85 billion monthly bond purchases. He said that nothing was set in stone and that all depended on what the economic data revealed in the months to come. He made the analogy to driving a car. "Any slowing in the pace of purchases will be akin to letting up a bit on the gas pedal as the car picks up speed, not to beginning to apply the brakes," he said.
But the fact that the bond and stock markets panicked in the wake of these relatively innocuous statements is a testament to how off-kilter things have gotten: the market has become addicted to the Fed's artificial stimulus and the mere thought of its ending has brought on the ugly symptoms of withdrawal.
To Mr. Bernanke's credit, the idea behind quantitative easing is intellectually creative, especially when the sole rate that the Fed can unilaterally control -- the short-term federal funds rate -- is already, at 0.25 percent, about as low as it can go. With such an extraordinary level of demand injected into the bond markets (which has driven prices higher), long-term yields, which move in the opposite direction of prices, have fallen to preposterously low levels.
Mr. Bernanke's bet remains that these low interest rates will spur increases in home buying, corporate borrowing and consumer spending, which in turn will increase the overall demand for goods and services and lead businesses to hire more workers.
But so far, the biggest beneficiaries of quantitative easing haven't been workers and consumers, but rather the Wall Street banks that have taken the cheap money that Mr. Bernanke insists on giving them and have gorged on the very Treasury and mortgage securities that the Fed has agreed to buy at artificially inflated market prices.
It has been a virtuous, and profitable, circle for the big banks that thrive on this kind of easy arbitrage. For the millions of Americans who live on fixed incomes, though, quantitative easing has been a disaster. Savings go unrewarded, and in order to get any meaningful return, investors have had little choice but to overpay for risky debt securities -- or head to the stock market, which until recently had also been inflating like a balloon.
The good news is that, finally, the artificial high might just be coming to an end. No addiction is healthy and this one is no exception. Weaning ourselves off the Fed's cheap money will hurt. Between the sudden collapse of bond prices and the sharp drop in the stock market, investors are now feeling some pain. Good. A healthy economy demands that the price of borrowed money be set by the market to correspond with risk, not be distorted by a half-decade's worth of interventions from a central bank.
As we saw throughout much of 2007 and 2008, when markets badly misprice risk it can have disastrous consequences for economies throughout the world. The sooner we get clean, the better.

Abstract: A jobless rate of 7 percent works out to nearly 11 million officially jobless workers, and it implies a weak labor market in which millions more are forced to work part time.

Full text:   The recent announcements by the Federal Reserve have generated huge interest -- and, on Wall Street, a sell-off costing the Dow Jones industrial average more than 500 points in two days. Only six weeks ago, the Fed was talking about continued "downside risks to the economic outlook." On Wednesday, however, it said these risks had diminished since last fall, and that it expected further improvement to drive the jobless rate down to 7 percent by mid-2014, at which point it would end its stimulative bond-buying programs.
One plausible reason for the Fed's announcement of the imminent end of its stimulative program is that it hoped to take some air out of asset bubbles that have inflated as a result of its prolonged easy-money policies. The stock sell-off seemed to prove the point. Assuming prices stabilize soon, the Fed's statements could amount to a successful pre-emptive strike on nascent bubbles.
On the other hand, the Fed's underlying optimism is hard to fathom. There haven't been any compelling improvements in the economy since late last year. In the last half of 2012, the annual pace of broad economic growth hit 2.1 percent; in the first quarter of 2013, it was 1.8 percent. Inflation has fallen steadily to a recent annual pace of 1.05 percent, reflecting an economy that is operating well below capacity. Given these trends, the Fed could find that its latest policy statements have boxed it into positions that could be harmful to he economy.
Wednesday's announcement, for example, was the first time that the Fed specifically linked the end of its bond-buying programs to an unemployment rate of 7 percent. The jobless rate is currently 7.6 percent, compared with 7.8 percent at the onset of the latest round of bond-buying last year. But to ease up significantly with joblessness still at 7 percent could very well extend the current agonizing state of elevated joblessness.
A jobless rate of 7 percent works out to nearly 11 million officially jobless workers, and it implies a weak labor market in which millions more are forced to work part time. In a time of budget cuts, like the present, the jobless rate also fails to capture the loss of work from furloughs, which are being used by many government agencies to cope with the budget sequester. Perhaps worst of all, a jobless rate of 7 percent would not be low enough to push up wages. When even those who are working are not getting ahead, prospects for broad growth -- characterized by strong consumer demand and confident business investment -- are bleak.
The Fed is in a spot. If it continues its bond-buying programs, bubbles could form; but worse, if it ends the programs prematurely, economic weakness could persist and deepen.
The Fed chairman, Ben Bernanke, said that the plan could change as conditions warrant. That is reassuring. Still, the Fed can't keep buying bonds forever. The real responsibility for boosting the economy lies with Congress, where Republicans have thwarted most attempts to spur growth, create jobs and strengthen the safety net, while successfully focusing the attention of the Obama administration on deficit reduction -- exactly the wrong remedy for today's economy.
We wish we could share the Fed's optimism, but until monetary policy and fiscal policy -- and politics, in general -- are more consistent and functional, the outlook just doesn't look all that bright.

Abstract: The Fed has amassed more than $3 trillion in Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities, and Mr. Bernanke said that it no longer intended to sell the mortgage bonds as the economy improved. Yet public attention focused almost entirely on the least potent part of the Fed's stimulus effort, its pledge to expand its holdings of mortgage bonds and Treasuries to increase job growth.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, meant to deliver two dollops of good news on Wednesday: the economy is doing better, and the Fed is determined to keep it that way. He announced that the Fed would extend one part of its stimulus campaign, suggested that it might extend another part, and offered new details about the timing.
Yet his primary audience, the investors whose decisions spread Fed policy through the economy, responded as if the news had been grim. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index took its worst two-day dive since November 2011 and has lost 5 percent of its value in the last month. Wells Fargo, the nation's largest mortgage lender, raised its advertised rate on 30-year loans to 4.5 percent from 3.9 percent in the same period.
The call-and-response underscores the complexity of the Fed's task as it seeks to do more to help the economy, but not too much.
Fed officials increasingly are convinced that they are finally doing enough to stimulate the economy -- not just the steps already taken, but the plans they have detailed for the next several years. That is why they felt comfortable suggesting that they could begin before the end of the year to scale back their purchases of government securities. But some critics see clear evidence in the persistence of high unemployment and low inflation that the Fed should do even more. And many others are simply nervous.
"People aren't sure that the economy is well enough for the Fed to pull back," said Paul Christopher, chief international strategist at Wells Fargo Advisors. "The market is signaling to the Fed that we don't trust your assessment of the economy; we don't trust your assessment of inflation."
On Wednesday, Mr. Bernanke sought to underscore that the Fed still planned to stimulate the economy on a big scale over the next few years. The central bank continues to hold short-term interest rates near zero, and Mr. Bernanke said it might maintain that policy for longer than previously expected. The Fed has amassed more than $3 trillion in Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities, and Mr. Bernanke said that it no longer intended to sell the mortgage bonds as the economy improved.
Yet public attention focused almost entirely on the least potent part of the Fed's stimulus effort, its pledge to expand its holdings of mortgage bonds and Treasuries to increase job growth.
Those purchases will continue for now, but Mr. Bernanke for the first time sketched a timeline for winding them down, beginning this year and ending next summer, as long as growth keeps pace with the Fed's expectations. Specifically, he said that the Fed expected the unemployment rate to decline to 7 percent by next summer, from 7.6 percent in May.
Many investors responded as if Mr. Bernanke had said only that the Fed soon intended to reduce its bond purchases.
This was a good demonstration of the difference between probably and certainly. While the timeline generally corresponded to investors' expectations, Mr. Bernanke's remarks made it official. And his repeated insistence that investors should focus instead on the evolution of economic data worked about as well as telling people not to think about purple kangaroos.
"If you draw the conclusion that I've just said that our policies, that our purchases will end in the middle of next year, you've drawn the wrong conclusion, because our purchases are tied to what happens in the economy," Mr. Bernanke said in one response to a question at a news conference on Wednesday.
Some analysts and economists said the reaction was particularly striking because the Fed seemed more committed than ever to its stimulus campaign.
"They are getting very close to where I would have had them be two or three years ago," said Joseph E. Gagnon, a former Fed economist and architect of the first round of asset purchases who is now a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. "I find it odd, and probably the chairman is surprised and unhappy with the market reaction, too."
The Fed declined on Thursday to comment on the market reaction to Mr. Bernanke's remarks. But he expressed himself clearly during the news conference on the negative market response since his last public appearance in May. "Well, we were a little puzzled by that," he said.
He also acknowledged that the Fed might need to respond if the market's reaction persisted. "It's important to understand that our policies are economic-dependent," he said. "And in particular, if financial conditions move in a way that makes this economic scenario unlikely, for example, then that would be a reason for us to adjust our policy."
Some analysts said that would not be necessary, arguing that the market would soon settle down.
Others, however, saw legitimate reasons for concern.
The Fed has made the unemployment rate the measuring stick for its stimulus effort. It doubled down on Wednesday by saying that it would buy bonds until the rate fell to 7 percent.
But the unemployment rate so far has fallen almost entirely because people have stopped looking for work. The share of adults with jobs, known as the employment-to-population ratio, has barely changed over the last three years. In past recoveries, declining unemployment has encouraged people to re-enter the labor market, but some economists argue that that will not begin to happen until the rate falls well below 7 percent.
"Why is monetary policy linked to unemployment rate as opposed to employment-to-population ratio?" Amir Sufi, an economist at the University of Chicago, wrote on Twitter. "Seems bonkers. Does anyone seriously think labor market is improving dramatically?"
Jan Hatzius, chief economist at Goldman Sachs, wrote in an e-mail that he doubted the Fed's current plans would be sufficient. "I am much less sanguine under our forecasts for the economy," he wrote, "and to a somewhat lesser degree even under theirs."

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve, increasingly confident in the durability of economic growth, expects to start pulling back later this year from its efforts to stimulate the economy, the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said on Wednesday.
Mr. Bernanke, offering new details, said the central bank intends to scale down gradually its monthly purchases of Treasury securities and mortgage-backed bonds beginning later this year and ending when the unemployment rate hits 7 percent, which the Fed expects to happen by the middle of next year.
The central bank would then take several more years to unwind the rest of its extraordinary stimulus campaign, slowly raising short-term interest rates from essentially zero to more normal levels after the jobless rate has fallen to 6.5 percent or lower.
He emphasized, however, that the timing of the retreat depends on the health of the economy; if growth falters, the central bank would slow, or even reverse, the process. The expectations of Fed officials for the next several years, published Wednesday, are more optimistic than the consensus of private forecasters.
Pulling back "would basically say that we've had a relatively decent economic outcome in terms of sustained improvement in growth and unemployment," Mr. Bernanke said. "If things are worse, we will do more. If things are better, we will do less."
Mr. Bernanke's comments, which followed a two-day meeting of the Fed's policy-making committee, appeared to disappoint investors on Wall Street who had hoped that the central bank would do more for longer. Stocks fell, with the broad Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropping 1.39 percent; interest rates rose.
The impact on the economy will take longer to judge. The Fed's goal is to pull back as the economy gains strength so its departure is barely felt, like a parent who lets go of a bike at the moment a child is ready to ride. But the Fed has removed its hands too soon several times in recent years. On the other side of the equation, the central bank, at some point, runs the risk of pushing too hard for too long, which can also cause crashes.
Gennadiy Goldberg, an analyst at TD Securities, described the market's reaction as "emblematic of the lumpy path toward normalization," illustrating the limits of the Fed's ability to control the way that the economy will respond to its retreat.
The housing market is an example. The Fed, deciding last year that it needed to do more, began to buy mortgage bonds in an effort to drive down borrowing costs. The lower rates spurred a wave of refinancing and home buying. But now, as the recovery gains momentum and the Fed signals that it plans to pull back, interest rates are beginning to rise and mortgage refinancing is beginning to wane.
Mr. Bernanke said on Wednesday that the rate increases were a "good thing," a sign that the economy is returning to health.
But Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the Fed still runs the risk of withdrawing its extra support for the economy too soon.
"Later in the cycle, we will be happy to take that view too," Mr. Shepherdson wrote Wednesday. "But not now, and it is very odd coming from a Fed chairman who has placed so much emphasis on the role of housing in the recovery. We do not think the market is yet ready to absorb higher rates."
The Fed, in a statement released after the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, sounded notes of increased optimism about the economy, but unusually, the statement did not describe the bond-buying timeline. Mr. Bernanke said he had been "deputized" to share the details at the news conference.
The statement said that the economy was expanding "at a moderate pace" and that the job market was improving. Most significantly, it noted that risks to growth had "diminished since last fall," an important assertion because the Fed has been trying in part to shield the economy from the consequences of reductions in federal spending. Those consequences have been milder than expected.
In a separate forecast released at the same time, Fed officials predicted that the unemployment rate would decline more quickly than they had projected, dropping to between 6.5 percent and 6.8 percent by the end of 2014. In March, they predicted that the rate would fall by the end of next year to between 6.7 percent and 7 percent.
The Fed said that it would continue for now to buy $85 billion a month in Treasury securities and mortgage-backed bonds, in addition to holding short-term interest rates near zero. Both policies are intended to ease financial conditions, to encourage economic activity and to increase the pace of job creation.
Two of the 12 members of the Federal Open Market Committee dissented. Esther George, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, reiterated her concern that the Fed was doing too much. James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, broke with the majority for the first time this year to express concern about the sagging pace of inflation.
Economic conditions have improved modestly since the Fed began its latest round of asset purchases last September. The economy has added about 197,000 jobs a month, and the unemployment rate has fallen slightly to 7.6 percent in May from 7.8 percent in September.
But the economic damage of the recession remains largely unrepaired. Job growth is basically keeping pace with population growth. The share of American adults with jobs has not increased in three years. Moreover, the Fed's preferred measure of inflation has shrunk to an annual pace 1.05 percent, the lowest level in more than 50 years, as the economy continues to operate below capacity.
The Fed would prefer annual inflation to run closer to 2 percent, diminishing the risk of outright deflation, or a general fall in the level of prices, which can paralyze economic activity as buyers wait for lower prices.
Despite the fact that unemployment remains high and inflation remains low, the Fed has shown no sign of interest in expanding the pace of its stimulus campaign. Officials say that they are doing as much as they can. The debate instead has focused on how soon the Fed can afford to start buying fewer bonds.
Mr. Bernanke said on Wednesday that even as the Fed pulls back, it still would be increasing its total bond holdings each month, and therefore that the stimulating effect also would continue to increase. He also emphasized the Fed's intent to hold short-term rates near zero well beyond the end of the asset purchases, a policy that the Fed regards as significantly more potent.
"Our intent from the beginning was to use asset purchases as a way to achieve some near-term momentum and then to allow the low interest rate policy to carry us through," he said.
The Fed has said that rates would remain near zero at least as long as the unemployment rate remained above 6.5 percent. Mr. Bernanke said the Fed might well hold rates low for longer, particularly if inflation remained weak. He added that the Fed would consider adopting a lower threshold. The goal, he said, was to stabilize unemployment between 5 percent and 6 percent.
Mr. Bernanke is unlikely to preside over those decisions. His second term as chairman ends next January, and President Obama reinforced expectations Monday that Mr. Bernanke would not be nominated by the White House to serve a third term. Mr. Bernanke declined to answer several questions about the president's remarks and his own plans at his news conference on Wednesday, insisting that Fed policy should be the sole focus.

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDEDEven as President Bashar al-Assad of Syria is proclaiming battlefield momentum against the insurgency with the help of his Hezbollah ally, he appears to be facing a new threat: a rapidly weakening currency that has unnerved many Syrians.
The currency, the Syrian pound, fell about 30 percent in value against the dollar over the weekend, partly on news that the United States intended to arm some elements of the rebellion seeking to topple Mr. Assad.
Money traders and economists said the plunge might have been accelerated by the apparent unwillingness -- or inability -- of Syria's Central Bank to halt it by buying pounds with dollars or euros, suggesting the government's supply of foreign exchange reserves is running low.
The Central Bank governor, Adib Mayalah, announced Tuesday that to help stabilize the pound, Syria would tap into a $1 billion credit line provided by Iran. That appeared to be helping on Wednesday. But the effects of that aid are considered temporary at best, as Iran is facing its own severe financial constraints.
For Mr. Assad, a number of basic financial problems appear to be coalescing after more than two years of conflict: Western sanctions that have collapsed Syria's main money-earning industries of oil and tourism, a near-collapse of regular commerce inside the country and the cost of fighting the insurgency, which has left more than 93,000 people dead and millions displaced.
The pound, which traded at about 47 per dollar before the uprising against Mr. Assad began in March 2011, has been eroding gradually since then and was trading at 170 per dollar last week. Money traders in Syria and the United States said it nose-dived starting last Friday and had weakened to 220 per dollar by Monday, reflecting some chaotic selling by Syrians worried that the pound could weaken further and wipe out their savings if they did not convert to dollars or euros.
Syria experts who once estimated the Central Bank had at least $17 billion in foreign exchange reserves before the conflict now believe that, because of Mr. Assad's international isolation and the cost of the war, that amount has dwindled to as little as $2 billion.
"Syria's government doesn't have cash," said Andrew J. Tabler, a Syria scholar at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. "They might be good at shooting people, but they're not so good at the economic stuff."
Others said the Central Bank's effort this week to arrest the pound's decline had strengthened it to about 190 per dollar by Wednesday, but they suspected the pound would resume falling.
Some were suggesting it could go to 500 to the dollar, which could cause enormous inflation problems in Syria.
A Syrian expatriate currency market trader, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he has relatives in the country, said he believed the credit line from Iran was a short-term psychological tool and might not even exist. A further strengthening of the pound would be a telling indicator.
"Unless they're able to knock it back to 150, I would imagine it would just be a cosmetic process," he said. "I'm personally extremely skeptical."
In a separate possible signal of Iran's frugality, officials of the Palestinian militant organization Hamas, which governs the Gaza Strip, said Wednesday that Iranian financial assistance had declined sharply in recent months. They attributed it to Hamas's decision to break with Mr. Assad over his efforts to crush the Syria uprising.
"We are suffering from a financial crisis and we are trying to go beyond the problem," said Ghazi Hamad, deputy minister of foreign affairs in the Hamas government.
Officials in Gaza refused to disclose figures, but experts in Gaza estimated that Iran had been channeling about $20 million a month to Gaza.
Correction: July 1, 2013, Monday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on June 20 about the sharp decline in the value of the Syrian pound, Syria's national currency, misstated its exchange rate before March 2011, when the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad began. It was about 47 to the dollar, not 70 to the dollar.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, faces the increasingly difficult challenge of shaping investor expectations about the future course of Fed policy amid growing signs that the Bernanke era at the central bank is drawing to a close.
President Obama suggested late Monday that he was likely to nominate a new Fed chairman this year, saying that Mr. Bernanke had "already stayed a lot longer than he wanted or he was supposed to." Mr. Obama added that Mr. Bernanke, whose second four-year term in office ends in January, has done an "outstanding job."
The comments bounced around Washington on Tuesday even as Mr. Bernanke convened a regularly scheduled meeting of the Fed's policy-making committee to debate how much longer the Fed will continue its current efforts to stimulate the economy. The Fed is not expected to announce any immediate changes on Wednesday, at the close of the meeting, but investors are watching for signs that the Fed is considering scaling back later this year.
The central bank is buying $85 billion a month in mortgage-backed securities and Treasury securities, in addition to holding short-term interest rates near zero. Both measures are intended to encourage job creation by easing financial conditions, and the Fed pledged to press the campaign until it saw "sustained improvement" in the outlook for the labor market.
But that message has been muddled recently by conflicting pronouncements about the duration of the asset purchases from several of the 19 Fed officials who help make policy. Mr. Bernanke contributed to the confusion by telling Congress last month that the Fed might begin to reduce the pace of its purchases this year -- but might not -- while avoiding any clear account of how the central bank would make such a decision.
Uncertainty about the Fed's plans and its leadership has focused attention on the news conference that Mr. Bernanke plans to hold on Wednesday afternoon after the Federal Open Market Committee releases a policy statement. The Fed also will release economic projections by the 19 officials, which could help to explain the apparent momentum toward doing less by showing how quickly they expect the economy to grow and unemployment to decline.
"Federal Reserve officials believe that clear communication about policy intentions can help manage market expectations and so increase the effectiveness of monetary policy," Kevin Logan, chief United States economist at HSBC, wrote to clients on Monday. "Lately, however, the policy makers appear to have muddled the message and so have created confusion rather than clarity on the policy outlook." The news conference, he said, is a chance "to clarify."
The confusion is costly. A recent survey of the 21 companies authorized to trade securities with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, a list that includes most of the nation's largest financial companies, found widespread agreement that uncertainty about the Fed's plans was effectively tightening financial conditions. Interest rates on 10-year Treasuries, a benchmark for the Fed's efforts to reduce borrowing costs, rose to 2.20 percent on Tuesday from a low of 1.66 percent at the start of May.
Some analysts argue that the Fed still intends to press ahead with asset purchases at least through the end of the year. They note that Mr. Bernanke has allowed dissenters to command the public stage even as they exercise relatively little influence over the course of Fed policy. Some also see the cacophony as an intentional damper on the ebullience of investors, carving out time for the benefits of low interest rates to spread through the economy.
The unemployment rate has fallen only slightly since the Fed began its latest round of bond buying, to 7.6 percent in May from 7.8 percent in September. And even that decline happened mostly because people stopped looking for work. The share of American adults with jobs has not increased in three years. The Fed's preferred measure of inflation has sagged to 1.05 percent, the lowest level in more than 50 years and markedly below the 2 percent annual pace the Fed considers healthy.
"In our view it would be risky to deliver a hawkish monetary policy message at a time when growth remains sluggish, inflation continues to trend down and market inflation expectations are dropping sharply," Goldman Sachs economists wrote in a note to clients last week.
Other analysts, however, see mounting evidence that Mr. Bernanke and his allies would like to buy fewer bonds, although most still do not expect the Fed to reduce the pace of its asset purchases before September at the earliest. Fed officials have described the asset purchases as an experiment with uncertain consequences, particularly the potential disruption of financial markets, and warned that those risks might increase with the size of the Fed's holdings.
While the pace of growth has increased only modestly, the worst-case possibility, in which mismanaged fiscal policy sends the economy sliding back into recession, has faded. "The asset purchases may have been simply insurance against a fiscal disaster that did not materialize," wrote Tim Duy, an economist at the University of Oregon.
Moreover, some Fed officials have concluded that large job gains are beyond reach. Economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland wrote recently that the Fed should be satisfied if the economy adds 150,000 jobs a month -- well below the monthly average of 176,000 so far this year. Economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago set the bar even lower, at 80,000 jobs a month. Both estimates are based on the assumption that many of the people who stopped looking for work in recent years will never return, allowing the unemployment rate to return closer to its normal levels during an economic expansion even without a rebound in employment.
Some of these decisions will most likely be made after Mr. Bernanke leaves office. Mr. Obama, in an interview with the journalist Charlie Rose on PBS, avoided answering a direct question about reappointing Mr. Bernanke. He said instead that Mr. Bernanke "has been an outstanding partner along with the White House, in helping us recover much stronger than, for example, our European partners, from what could have been an economic crisis of epic proportions."
The interview, taken together with earlier comments by Mr. Bernanke, reinforces a growing expectation that the administration plans to nominate a new Fed chairman this year. The position requires Senate confirmation. Only three people have held the Fed chairmanship in the last 30 years, and the Obama administration has an opportunity to put a Democrat atop the central bank for the first time since the resignation of Paul Volcker in the late 1980s.
Janet L. Yellen, the Fed's vice chairwoman, is widely regarded as a leading candidate. She would become the first woman to head the Fed or any other major central bank. Other possible candidates include Timothy F. Geithner and Lawrence H. Summers, both former Obama advisers, and Roger W. Ferguson Jr., a former Fed vice chairman.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Builders stepped up home construction in May and applied for permits to build single-family homes at the fastest pace in five years. The gains show housing remained a crucial source of growth for the economy.
The overall pace of homes started rose 6.8 percent in May to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 914,000, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday. That offset part of the 14.8 percent decline in April. May's rate is still below March's rate of more than one million -- the fastest in five years.
Construction increased in May for single-family homes, apartments and condominiums.
Builders sought more permits to build single-family homes, which represent about two-thirds of the market. The seasonally adjusted annual rate rose 1.3 percent to 622,000 -- the highest since May 2008. That is a sign that construction will increase further in the coming months.
Permits fell 3.1 percent in May to a seasonally adjusted of 974,000 because of a drop in apartment permits, which are more volatile.
Also, the Labor Department reported on Tuesday that consumer prices rose slightly last month, as higher energy costs partly offset cheaper food. The increase is further evidence that consumers are benefiting from mild inflation.
The Consumer Price Index ticked up a seasonally adjusted 0.1 percent in May from April, the department said. Over the last 12 months, prices have risen just 1.4 percent.
Excluding volatile food and gas costs, core prices rose 0.2 percent in May from April. Core prices have risen only 1.7 percent in the last 12 months, in line with the Federal Reserve's inflation target of 2 percent.
"Inflation has faded to only a minor irritant," Michael Montgomery, an economist at IHS Global Insight, said in a note to clients.
The building report pointed to more signs of a housing recovery that has become sustainable. New-home construction has risen 28.6 percent since May 2012.
"Starts have clearly been trending up," said Jim F. O'Sullivan, chief United States economist for High Frequency Economics. "While levels are still low, housing has been the strongest part of the economy in growth terms."
Still, some markets are recovering faster than others. In May, housing starts rose 17.8 percent in the South and 5.7 percent in the West. But they fell 13.7 percent in the Midwest and 9 percent in the Northeast.

Abstract: [...]despite Mr. Volcker's enormous skepticism about the merits of inflation, a heretical thought that first surfaced as the economic crisis gripped the world five years ago is again gaining traction among experts: economic policy should be aiming for significantly higher inflation than the 1 to 2 percent annual rate that the United States economy is currently experiencing. The experience of the Great Recession over the last five years has persuaded many economists, among them Olivier Blanchard, the chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, that a higher inflation target in good times would allow central banks to do more to fix things when the economy went bad.

Full text:   I was in Brazil in the early 1990s, when annual inflation topped 2,000 percent and Brazilians spent their entire paychecks as soon as they got them, buying a month's worth of food and other supplies before their money lost most of its value. When I moved there a few years later, inflation had been "tamed" to some 16 percent. But you couldn't buy oranges at the supermarket in packages of less than 20 pounds.
So I understand Paul Volcker's impatience with those tempted to let inflation rip -- at least a little bit -- to spur economic growth.
"The implicit assumption behind that siren call must be that the inflation rate can be manipulated to reach economic objectives -- up today, maybe a little more tomorrow, and then pulled back on command," Mr. Volcker said in a speech at the Economic Club of New York a few weeks ago. "All experience amply demonstrates that inflation, when fairly and deliberately started, is hard to control and reverse."
And yet despite Mr. Volcker's enormous skepticism about the merits of inflation, a heretical thought that first surfaced as the economic crisis gripped the world five years ago is again gaining traction among experts: economic policy should be aiming for significantly higher inflation than the 1 to 2 percent annual rate that the United States economy is currently experiencing.
When Mr. Volcker took the helm of the Federal Reserve in 1979, inflation neared 12 percent -- a catastrophe by American standards. He spent much of his eight-year tenure strangling the economy with high interest rates. By 1983 the unemployment rate surpassed 10 percent -- a feat not replicated even in the latest recession. He was reviled by home builders and auto dealers, whose businesses depend on credit. Prominent members of Congress asked him to resign.
Mr. Volcker ultimately won his battle. In 1986 he brought inflation below 2 percent. That's the pace that has since become the de facto definition of "price stability," a target for central banks around the world. Among economic policy types, he is considered a hero.
But now mainstream economists like Kenneth Rogoff at Harvard are pressing the case that "a sustained burst of moderate inflation is not something to worry about."
"On the contrary," he wrote, "in most regions, it should be embraced."
The prescription fits the worldview of some "monetarist" economists, who argue that the Fed should set a higher target for the nominal gross domestic product, to be met through real economic growth and inflation. Conservative pundits like Josh Barro of Business Insider have welcomed inflation as the right's answer to fiscal stimulus -- a way to juice the economy without increasing government spending.
But it is hardly a conservative idea. Paul Krugman, a Nobel laureate and liberal columnist for The New York Times, has been writing about the benefits of higher inflation, arguing that policy makers should be using any available tool -- fiscal or monetary -- to try to reduce an unemployment rate stubbornly stuck at more than 7.5 percent for over four years.
To be sure, economists agree that inflation is no panacea. Higher inflation does not produce more growth or lower unemployment over the long term. There is a fairly solid consensus that unstable, volatile prices depress growth by short-circuiting decisions to spend and invest. That is why central bankers work so hard to "anchor" inflation expectations to a number.
But economists have also come to understand that an economy can suffer from too little inflation as well. Janet Yellen, the Fed's current vice chairwoman, convinced Alan Greenspan more than 15 years ago, when she was serving an earlier term on the Fed, that setting zero inflation as a target was a bad idea that would complicate the necessary adjustment of relative prices in the economy.
The experience of the Great Recession over the last five years has persuaded many economists, among them Olivier Blanchard, the chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, that a higher inflation target in good times would allow central banks to do more to fix things when the economy went bad.
With inflation anchored at 2 percent, real interest rates could fall no further than a negative 2 percent, hitting a floor when the nominal interest rate reached zero. If it had been anchored at 4 percent, real rates would have had further to go, providing a more robust boost to investment and spending.
These arguments apply to steady-state inflation in normal times. But with the economy still mired in the mud, and the odds of more fiscal stimulus near zero, economists like Mr. Rogoff and Gregory Mankiw of Harvard want to give the monetary screw another turn and have called on the Fed to engineer higher inflation now, aiming for maybe 4 percent or even 6 percent.
One main feature of inflation is that it reduces the real value of debt. Think of the $13 trillion in outstanding mortgages or the $12 trillion in government debt held by the public. Inflation would eat away at those obligations, without any need for bankruptcy lawyers. And it would leave more disposable income for Americans to spend.
Higher inflation in the United States would also weaken the dollar, helping exports. It would encourage people to spend now rather than sit on their cash.
And if the government engineered "monetary repression" to keep long-term interest rates below the economy's nominal growth rate, effectively forcing banks to buy lots of government bonds, a few years' worth of higher inflation could do wonders to reduce the public debt.
Mr. Rogoff points out that the case for higher inflation was stronger in 2008, when mortgage debt reached $14.5 trillion and debt service swallowed almost a fifth of households' disposable income. Still, he notes, a solid case remains for faster-rising prices around the world.
Higher inflation in Germany, Europe's juggernaut, would make it easier for the damaged economies that share the euro -- like Greece, Portugal and Spain -- to reduce their relative labor costs and increase their relative competitiveness.
Japan is finally giving higher prices a shot. In April, the new central bank governor, Haruhiko Kuroda, announced that he would pump huge amounts of yen into the economy to try to shake nearly two decades of stagnant, even falling, prices and raise inflation to 2 percent. While this would count as price stability by American standards, in Japan it amounts almost to runaway inflation.
Yet for all the merits of the argument, the chances of the policy's being more widely adopted are close to nil.
There is resistance from more than Mr. Volcker. Jeremy Stein, on the board of the Fed, has taken to worrying that the central bank's loose monetary policy is already imperiling the financial system, stoking future bubbles as banks load up on risky assets to achieve their profit targets. Mark Gertler at New York University worries that long-term interest rates would simply follow inflation up -- negating much of its benefit.
The Fed chairman, Ben Bernanke, told Congress last month that the central bank might soon move in the opposite direction, tightening monetary policy by cutting back on its program of bond purchases, which today total $85 billion a month.
And here's the best reason to be skeptical: even if the Fed wanted to engineer higher prices, it is far from obvious how it would do that.
The Fed is not just buying bonds. It is also keeping short-term interest rates at zero. And it promised to keep pushing the economy at least until the unemployment rate fell below 6.5 percent or inflation surpassed 2.5 percent.
And yet, inflation is going the other way. The economy is even flirting with deflation. The bigger risk in the United States is not that our money will buy fewer oranges tomorrow. It's that it will buy more.

Full text:   Investors are in a game of wait-and-see with the Federal Reserve. On Monday, they sent stocks higher as they guessed that the Fed would continue trying to prop up the economy.
The major stock indexes all rose about 1 percent in early trading and stayed there for most of the day before dipping slightly in the afternoon. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 12.31 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,639.04. It had been up as much as 20 points.
The market's gains were broad. Telecommunications was the only one of the 10 industry sectors in the S.& P. 500 to post a loss. Netflix did better than any other stock in the S.& P. 500 after announcing that it would run original TV series from DreamWorks Animation.
There were few big company announcements or economic reports, and trading was light. Investors will have to keep guessing about the Fed's future actions until Wednesday, when the chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, holds a news conference at the end of a two-day policy meeting.
Investors sent stocks up Monday because they think Fed policy makers will determine that the economy is not recovering fast enough. A still-weak economy would influence the Fed to continue its programs intended to stimulate the economy: keeping interest rates low to encourage borrowing, and buying bonds to push investors into stocks.
Doug Lockwood, branch president of Hefty Wealth Partners in Auburn, Ind., said it was not rational for the stock market to regard bad news as good, and to be yanked back and forth more by the actions of a central bank than the underlying fundamentals of the economy.
The market has been in flux since May 22, when Mr. Bernanke said that the Fed would consider pulling back on its bond-buying program if measures of the economy, especially hiring, improve. The comment, made in response to a question from the Joint Economic Committee in Congress, was not expected. In the 17 trading days since then, the Dow Jones industrial average has swung by triple digits 11 times.
On Monday, the Dow rose 109.67 points, or 0.7 percent, to 15,179.85. The Nasdaq composite rose 28.58, or 0.8 percent, to 3,452.13.
The price of crude oil rose throughout the day but ended 4 cents lower at $98.03 a barrel in New York. Gold edged down $4.50 to $1,383.10 an ounce.
In the market for government bonds, the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 13/32 to 96 7/32, bringing the yield up to 2.18 percent from 2.13 percent late Friday.
Jim McDonald, chief investment strategist at Northern Trust in Chicago, said Mr. Bernanke would seek to "walk back" on some of his previous comments, and reassure investors that the Fed will not pull back on stimulus until it is sure the economy is ready. The surprise factor, more than the substance of Mr. Bernanke's comments, might have been what unnerved investors, McDonald said.
The fact that Mr. Bernanke is now expected to regard the economy as still weak enough to need stimulus stems from a jobs report and low inflation since his testimony, analysts said.
This month, the government reported that the United States added 175,000 jobs in May -- not enough to cut into the unemployment rate. And on Friday, the government said that a crucial measure of inflation -- the producer price index, which measures wholesale prices -- rose just 0.1 percent after stripping out the volatile costs of food and gas. That is important because the Fed knows that its stimulus measures can stoke inflation; if inflation is low, the central bank has more flexibility to keep pumping money into the economy.
Two measures of economic data released on Monday were positive, though both are considered less important gauges of the economy. A report on manufacturing in New York State showed a pickup, and a survey of American home builders said they were more optimistic about sales than they had been in seven years.

Abstract: American and European officials said in interviews that arguments over austerity versus stimulus, so prominent at international gatherings in recent years, are likely to be muted at the two-day summit conference of the Group of 8 industrialized countries that is being held at the lakeside Lough Erne resort in Enniskillen, Northern Ireland. Besides Mr. Obama, participants include the leaders of Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and Russia -- countries that account for about half of the world's economic activity.

Full text:   As President Obama begins an annual meeting with the leaders of some of the world's richest nations on Monday in Northern Ireland, the economic-policy gulf that has divided them since the global crash in 2008 has narrowed significantly -- just not exactly in ways that the White House would have liked.
The Europeans lately have slightly eased their austerity policies, after four years of deep spending cuts and rising taxes that many economists blame for keeping the Continent in recession long after America's ended.
And the Obama administration, after years of pressing Europe to adopt American-style stimulus measures, is now presiding -- if reluctantly -- over European-style austerity that is measurably slowing its recovery.
Much of that austerity is in the form of across-the-board spending cuts known as sequestration that were forced by Republicans in Congress. But Mr. Obama supported an end this year to both a temporary payroll-tax cut, which the Congressional Budget Office and private analysts credited with spurring consumer spending and creating jobs, and the Bush-era income tax cuts for the wealthy. What stimulus remains in the American economy can be credited to the expansionary monetary policies of the independent Federal Reserve System.
That new reality in the United States reduces the president's already limited leverage in his fiscal debate with Europeans, analysts on both sides of the Atlantic say, even as Europe's woes continue to act as a drag on its trading partners, including the United States.
"President Obama will continue trying to lead by persuasion rather than by example," said Eswar Shanker Prasad, an economics professor at Cornell University and a former official of the International Monetary Fund. "The U.S. is likely to push other countries towards adopting measures to support growth, including a slowdown in the drive for fiscal austerity, but against the backdrop of its own premature fiscal tightening."
With the United States "just beginning to solidify its recovery, the last thing it needs right now is a major shock emanating from Europe," Mr. Prasad added. "But the reality is that the U.S. can only jawbone. It cannot really influence policies in any substantive way."
American and European officials said in interviews that arguments over austerity versus stimulus, so prominent at international gatherings in recent years, are likely to be muted at the two-day summit conference of the Group of 8 industrialized countries that is being held at the lakeside Lough Erne resort in Enniskillen, Northern Ireland. Besides Mr. Obama, participants include the leaders of Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and Russia -- countries that account for about half of the world's economic activity.
The reduced emphasis on stimulus versus austerity occurs even as unemployment remains at double digits in much of Europe, stoking unrest especially among the young. In part it reflects the fact that this spring, in advance of the summit conference, Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew and his counterparts among European financial ministers hashed out their differences so the heads of state could focus elsewhere. Also, the Group of 8 agenda is set by the gathering's host -- for this meeting, the conservative and pro-austerity prime minister of Britain, David Cameron.
Yet even Mr. Cameron's agenda, on international taxation, tax transparency and trade, is likely to be overshadowed by the allies' intensifying debate over whether and how to intervene in Syria's worsening civil war.
That likelihood was suggested late Friday by a summary from Mr. Cameron's Downing Street office about his pre-summit videoconference with Mr. Obama, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, President François Hollande of France and Prime Minister Enrico Letta of Italy. They discussed "how G-8 countries should all agree to work together on a political transition to end the conflict" in Syria, according to the statement from London. But significantly, the call did not include President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, Syria's most important ally and arms provider.
Administration officials say that Mr. Obama is likely to make his most fulsome economic arguments against Europe's continued emphasis on budget cutting -- and for the relatively successful American model -- after the Group of 8 meeting, when he flies to Germany. On Wednesday he is to be in Berlin for a state visit with Ms. Merkel.
The German chancellor, as the leader of Europe's biggest and strongest economy, has had an outsize influence on the economic direction of the European Union. She and the German finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, have insisted that Greece, Portugal and other so-called peripheral economies among the 17 European Union nations that use the euro must continue to cut their budgets and to restructure costly labor, health and retirement programs for long-term fiscal stability. Providing additional bailouts without such budget pressure would only encourage further profligacy, the Germans contend, and it could set off inflation.
Germany recently acquiesced, however, to give France, Portugal, Italy and Spain two more years to reduce their deficits to the European Union's target, freeing them to perhaps loosen spending and cut taxes in the short term with the aim of increasing consumer demand and business activity. The administration, while applauding the concession, would have preferred that the Germans had instead allowed the other countries to increase their deficits, not just delay their deficit reductions.
Mr. Prasad, the international economist, said Mr. Obama would have "a tough sell" with Ms. Merkel.
"But I think even Merkel has come around to the view that pushing too hard on fiscal policy in the short term is going to be potentially counterproductive," he added. "The complication is that she faces elections in the fall, and the notion of continuing to subsidize the euro zone periphery economies is not something that would sell in Germany."
At the Group of 8, the opening session is for discussing the global economy. Previewing the summit meeting on Friday, Caroline Atkinson, Mr. Obama's chief adviser for the event, acknowledged that "the context for that discussion has changed a lot over the past year," given economic developments in both Europe and the United States.
"In Europe, for example, financial tensions have eased considerably, but large parts of Europe remain in recession and unemployment in some countries is at record highs," Ms. Atkinson said. "In the U.S., our recovery is under way. We've successfully avoided the fiscal cliff and our budget deficit is declining rapidly. But of course we have more work to do to create jobs."
She added, "We expect that G-8 leaders will express a consensus that growth and jobs are a top priority."
The problem is that the Americans and the European leaders continue to define what produces growth in different ways -- differences that have a parallel in the domestic debate between Mr. Obama and Republican lawmakers. Ms. Merkel and Mr. Cameron say that reducing deficits and debt to reassure lenders eventually will bring growth. The Americans say that the United States' recovery shows that, in a crisis, stimulus should come first and deficit reduction can follow once growth is restored.
"If Europe had done like we did, they may not be in the situation they're in," said Tony Fratto, a Treasury official during the George W. Bush administration. "Europe went straight to austerity before growth," he added. "They're actually still in a sustained recession -- and in some countries it's a sustained depression."
The European Union's top economic policy maker, Olli Rehn, has signaled a softening of austerity recently as a long-promised recovery failed to materialize. But in an interview last week, the European Commission president, José Manuel Barroso, seemed to rule out a program of economic stimulus.
Mr. Barroso challenged calls by Washington and also by many in Europe for a retreat from policies of austerity.
"Let's not forget why we came to this situation: in many cases because of high levels of public debt and we have seen that growth fueled by debt is simply not sustainable," he said.

Abstract: Over the past decades, the Communist Party has flip-flopped on peasants' rights to use land: giving small plots to farm during 1950s land reform, collectivizing a few years later, restoring rights at the start of the reform era and now trying to obliterate small landholders.

Full text:   BEIJING -- China is pushing ahead with a sweeping plan to move 250 million rural residents into newly constructed towns and cities over the next dozen years -- a transformative event that could set off a new wave of growth or saddle the country with problems for generations to come.
The government, often by fiat, is replacing small rural homes with high-rises, paving over vast swaths of farmland and drastically altering the lives of rural dwellers. So large is the scale that the number of brand-new Chinese city dwellers will approach the total urban population of the United States -- in a country already bursting with megacities.
This will decisively change the character of China, where the Communist Party insisted for decades that most peasants, even those working in cities, remain tied to their tiny plots of land to ensure political and economic stability. Now, the party has shifted priorities, mainly to find a new source of growth for a slowing economy that depends increasingly on a consuming class of city dwellers.
The shift is occurring so quickly, and the potential costs are so high, that some fear rural China is once again the site of radical social engineering. Over the past decades, the Communist Party has flip-flopped on peasants' rights to use land: giving small plots to farm during 1950s land reform, collectivizing a few years later, restoring rights at the start of the reform era and now trying to obliterate small landholders.
Across China, bulldozers are leveling villages that date to long-ago dynasties. Towers now sprout skyward from dusty plains and verdant hillsides. New urban schools and hospitals offer modern services, but often at the expense of the torn-down temples and open-air theaters of the countryside.
"It's a new world for us in the city," said Tian Wei, 43, a former wheat farmer in the northern province of Hebei, who now works as a night watchman at a factory. "All my life I've worked with my hands in the fields; do I have the educational level to keep up with the city people?"
China has long been home to both some of the world's tiniest villages and its most congested, polluted examples of urban sprawl. The ultimate goal of the government's modernization plan is to fully integrate 70 percent of the country's population, or roughly 900 million people, into city living by 2025. Currently, only half that number are.
The building frenzy is on display in places like Liaocheng, which grew up as an entrepôt for local wheat farmers in the North China Plain. It is now ringed by scores of 20-story towers housing now-landless farmers who have been thrust into city life. Many are giddy at their new lives -- they received the apartments free, plus tens of thousands of dollars for their land -- but others are uncertain about what they will do when the money runs out.
Aggressive state spending is planned on new roads, hospitals, schools, community centers -- which could cost upward of $600 billion a year, according to economists' estimates. In addition, vast sums will be needed to pay for the education, health care and pensions of the ex-farmers.
While the economic fortunes of many have improved in the mass move to cities, unemployment and other social woes have also followed the enormous dislocation. Some young people feel lucky to have jobs that pay survival wages of about $150 a month; others wile away their days in pool halls and video-game arcades.
Top-down efforts to quickly transform entire societies have often come to grief, and urbanization has already proven one of the most wrenching changes in China's 35 years of economic transition. Land disputes account for thousands of protests each year, including dozens of cases in recent years in which people have set themselves aflame rather than relocate.
The country's new prime minister, Li Keqiang, indicated at his inaugural news conference in March that urbanization was one of his top priorities. He also cautioned, however, that it would require a series of accompanying legal changes "to overcome various problems in the course of urbanization."
Some of these problems could include chronic urban unemployment if jobs are not available, and more protests from skeptical farmers unwilling to move. Instead of creating wealth, urbanization could result in a permanent underclass in big Chinese cities and the destruction of a rural culture and religion.
The government has been pledging a comprehensive urbanization plan for more than two years now. It was originally to have been presented at the National People's Congress in March, but various concerns delayed that, according to people close to the government. Some of them include the challenge of financing the effort, of coordinating among the various ministries and of balancing the rights of farmers, whose land has increasingly been taken forcibly for urban projects.
These worries delayed a high-level conference to formalize the plan this month. The plan has now been delayed until the fall, government advisers say. Central leaders are said to be concerned that spending will lead to inflation and bad debt.
Such concerns may have been behind the call in a recent government report for farmers' property rights to be protected. Released in March, the report said China must "guarantee farmers' property rights and interests." Land would remain owned by the state, though, so farmers would not have ownership rights even under the new blueprint.
On the ground, however, the new wave of urbanization is well under way. Almost every province has large-scale programs to move farmers into housing towers, with the farmers' plots then given to corporations or municipalities to manage. Efforts have been made to improve the attractiveness of urban life, but the farmers caught up in the programs typically have no choice but to leave their land.
The broad trend began decades ago. In the early 1980s, about 80 percent of Chinese lived in the countryside versus 47 percent today, plus an additional 17 percent that works in cities but is classified as rural. The idea is to speed up this process and achieve an urbanized China much faster than would occur organically.
The primary motivation for the urbanization push is to change China's economic structure, with growth based on domestic demand for products instead of relying so much on export. In theory, new urbanites mean vast new opportunities for construction companies, public transportation, utilities and appliance makers, and a break from the cycle of farmers consuming only what they produce. "If half of China's population starts consuming, growth is inevitable," said Li Xiangyang, vice director of the Institute of World Economics and Politics, part of a government research institute. "Right now they are living in rural areas where they do not consume."
Skeptics say the government's headlong rush to urbanize is driven by a vision of modernity that has failed elsewhere. In Brazil and Mexico, urbanization was also seen as a way to bolster economic growth. But among the results were the expansion of slums and of a stubborn unemployed underclass, according to experts.
"There's this feeling that we have to modernize, we have to urbanize and this is our national-development strategy," said Gao Yu, China country director for the Landesa Rural Development Institute, based in Seattle. Referring to the disastrous Maoist campaign to industrialize overnight, he added, "It's almost like another Great Leap Forward."
The costs of this top-down approach can be steep. In one survey by Landesa in 2011, 43 percent of Chinese villagers said government officials had taken or tried to take their land. That is up from 29 percent in a 2008 survey.
"In a lot of cases in China, urbanization is the process of local government driving farmers into buildings while grabbing their land," said Li Dun, a professor of public policy at Tsinghua University in Beijing.
Farmers are often unwilling to leave the land because of the lack of job opportunities in the new towns. Working in a factory is sometimes an option, but most jobs are far from the newly built towns. And even if farmers do get jobs in factories, most lose them when they hit age 45 or 50, since employers generally want younger, nimbler workers.
"For old people like us, there's nothing to do anymore," said He Shifang, 45, a farmer from the city of Ankang in Shaanxi Province who was relocated from her family's farm in the mountains. "Up in the mountains we worked all the time. We had pigs and chickens. Here we just sit around and people play mah-jongg."
Some farmers who have given up their land say that when they come back home for good around this age, they have no farm to tend and thus no income. Most are still excluded from national pension plans, putting pressure on relatives to provide.
The coming urbanization plan would aim to solve this by giving farmers a permanent stream of income from the land they lost. Besides a flat payout when they moved, they would receive a form of shares in their former land that would pay the equivalent of dividends over a period of decades to make sure they did not end up indigent.
This has been tried experimentally, with mixed results. Outside the city of Chengdu, some farmers said they received nothing when their land was taken to build a road, leading to daily confrontations with construction crews and the police since the beginning of this year.
But south of Chengdu in Shuangliu County, farmers who gave up their land for an experimental strawberry farm run by a county-owned company said they receive an annual payment equivalent to the price of 2,000 pounds of grain plus the chance to earn about $8 a day working on the new plantation.
"I think it's O.K., this deal," said Huang Zifeng, 62, a farmer in the village of Paomageng who gave up his land to work on the plantation. "It's more stable than farming your own land."
Financing the investment needed to start such projects is a central sticking point. Chinese economists say that the cost does not have to be completely borne by the government -- because once farmers start working in city jobs, they will start paying taxes and contributing to social welfare programs.
"Urbanization can launch a process of value creation," said Xiang Songzuo, chief economist with the Agricultural Bank of China and a deputy director of the International Monetary Institute at Renmin University. "It should start a huge flow of revenues."
Even if this is true, the government will still need significant resources to get the programs started. Currently, local governments have limited revenues and most rely on selling land to pay for expenses -- an unsustainable practice in the long run. Banks are also increasingly unwilling to lend money to big infrastructure projects, Mr. Xiang said, because many banks are now listed companies and have to satisfy investors' requirements.
"Local governments are already struggling to provide benefits to local people, so why would they want to extend this to migrant workers?" said Tom Miller, a Beijing-based author of a new book on urbanization in China, "China's Urban Billion." "It is essential for the central government to step in and provide funding for this."
In theory, local governments could be allowed to issue bonds, but with no reliable system of rating or selling bonds, this is unlikely in the near term. Some localities, however, are already experimenting with programs to pay for at least the infrastructure by involving private investors or large state-owned enterprises that provide seed financing.
Most of the costs are borne by local governments. But they rely mostly on central government transfer payments or land sales, and without their own revenue streams they are unwilling to allow newly arrived rural residents to attend local schools or benefit from health care programs. This is reflected in the fact that China officially has a 53 percent rate of urbanization, but only about 35 percent of the population is in possession of an urban residency permit, or hukou. This is the document that permits a person to register in local schools or qualify for local medical programs.
The new blueprint to be unveiled this year is supposed to break this logjam by guaranteeing some central-government support for such programs, according to economists who advise the government. But the exact formulas are still unclear. Granting full urban benefits to 70 percent of the population by 2025 would mean doubling the rate of those in urban welfare programs.
"Urbanization is in China's future, but China's rural population lags behind in enjoying the benefits of economic development," said Li Shuguang, professor at the China University of Political Science and Law. "The rural population deserves the same benefits and rights city folks enjoy."
Leaving the Land: Articles in this series will look at how China's government-driven effort to push the population to towns and cities is reshaping a nation that for millenniums has been defined by its rural life.

Full text:   THE total wealth of American households has recovered from the financial crisis and Great Recession, according to the Federal Reserve Board. But that recovery has not been enough to keep up with inflation, and many Americans, particularly younger adults who took on heavy debt to acquire homes before the housing bubble collapsed, are lagging.
The Fed said last week that household wealth rose by $3 trillion in the first quarter, to $70.3 trillion. It was the first time the total exceeded the $68.1 trillion total posted in the third quarter of 2007, before the recession began, and was the largest quarterly increase since 1999, when the stock market was rising rapidly.
In the first quarter, a third of the gain in wealth came directly from rising values of corporate stocks owned by households. That was a little more than the gain attributed to rising real estate values.
The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis pointed out that there are more households now than there were in 2007, and that there has been inflation as well. As can be seen in an accompanying chart, the average household wealth at the end of the quarter was $613,635, a figure that is 11 percent below the peak of $689,996 (in 2013 dollars) set in the first quarter of 2007.
Those averages are deceptive, in that they are raised by the high wealth of a relatively small number of households. A very different picture emerges from looking at the median -- the level at which half the households are richer and half poorer. That statistic can be calculated from the Fed's triennial survey of consumer finances. In the studies conducted in the 1990s, the median net wealth was about one-quarter of the average. In the 2000s, the median fell to about one-fifth of the average, and in 2010, it was down to about one-sixth of the average.
During the housing boom, said William R. Emmons, the chief economist of the Center for Household Financial Stability at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, "exactly the people you would think need to act conservatively were doing the opposite." Homeownership rates, and mortgage debt levels, rose for younger households, as well as for less educated and minority ones. Those groups suffered more during the crisis, he said, and have been slower to recover.
Mr. Emmons compiled average wealth figures for different groups from the triennial surveys, and estimated how they have changed since the 2010 survey. The charts also show the results based on age. While all age groups have yet to recover to their 2007 wealth, when adjusted for inflation, older households are down just 3 percent on average, while those headed by middle-age people are down about 10 percent. But the decline is nearly 40 percent for the younger group.
During the housing boom, households ended up with more of their wealth in real estate than before, and mortgage debt rose to record levels relative to the size of the economy. The proportion of wealth in homes is now back to close to the level of the 1990s, but the debt levels remain high by historical standards.

Over All, Households Now Have Less Debt and Are Less Dependent On Real Estate Than They Were, but Those Figures Remain High by Historical Standards.

Full text:   During the three and a half years that she was held in prison or under house arrest, Judge Lourdes Afiuni became a symbol of political persecution for many in Venezuela under President Hugo Chávez. On Friday, a court in Caracas, acting at the government's request, ordered Ms. Afiuni to be set free in the latest sign of a shifting political landscape in post-Chávez Venezuela.
Ms. Afiuni was jailed in December 2009 after issuing a court ruling that infuriated Mr. Chávez, who went on television and demanded that she be sentenced to 30 years in prison. For years Mr. Chávez ignored international appeals for her release, including from the American leftist intellectual Noam Chomsky.
Mr. Chávez, a charismatic socialist, died in March, leaving a bitterly divided country.
His handpicked successor, Nicolás Maduro, was elected by a slim margin in April and since then has confronted political turmoil and serious economic difficulties that have tested his nascent leadership skills. As Mr. Maduro lurches from one crisis to the next, the quality he seems to have honed most is delivering mixed messages at top volume.
He branded President Obama "the big boss of the devils" and then sent his foreign minister to shake hands with Secretary of State John Kerry and call for warmer relations.
He assailed capitalists for causing soaring inflation and rampant product shortages and then sat down with the head of the country's biggest private company to discuss the economy.
And while he has relentlessly vilified the political opposition and the man he edged out in the election, Henrique Capriles Radonski, as traitors and coup plotters, his government has made some moves that could be seen as concessions to longstanding grievances of the opposition, which has been demanding Ms. Afiuni's release.
"There are lots of mixed signals," said Elsa Cardozo, a professor of political science at the Central University of Venezuela. "It is clear the government of President Maduro is in a situation that is forcing it to make some changes in direction. What we don't know is if they are permanent changes or tactical changes."
But while government opponents have long called for Ms. Afiuni's release, the action may actually be intended to counter an opposition campaign to take its message abroad, with leaders visiting countries around the world to make the case that Mr. Maduro was unfairly declared the winner of a flawed election and that his government is repressive.
The opposition routinely points to Ms. Afiuni as the most prominent among a group of what it calls political prisoners, who it says were jailed arbitrarily or were convicted in politically motivated trials.
"I view it as a sign from the government to the outside world, the international community, that it is trying to show that it is respectful of human rights," José Vicente Haro, a constitutional law expert, said of Ms. Afiuni's release.
Ms. Afiuni was arrested after she ordered a jailed businessman accused of evading currency controls freed while awaiting trial. She has said that the man had been held in custody for longer than Venezuelan law generally permitted under the circumstances and that her ruling complied with a recommendation by United Nations human rights monitors.
Her lawyer, José Amalio Graterol, confirmed reports last year that she was raped while in prison, became pregnant and had an abortion, which led to other health problems. She was moved to house arrest in Caracas in 2011.
Ms. Afiuni's trial began last November and is continuing, although she has refused to attend it.
Last week the national prosecutor's office made a surprise announcement that it had asked a court to release Ms. Afiuni from house arrest, citing her need for medical treatment. The prosecutor asked the court to require her to report to the authorities every 15 days and to bar her from leaving the country and speaking to the news media.
"A judge never should have been imprisoned for three years and six months for issuing a decision in accordance with the law," Ms. Afiuni's lawyer, Mr. Graterol, said Friday, adding that her case had intimidated other judges who feared defying the government.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Economic reports released on Friday weighed on investors, showing that consumer confidence has fallen this month and that American factories barely increased their output in May.
In addition, the Labor Department reported that a rise in food and gas costs drove a measure of wholesale prices up sharply in May. But outside those volatile categories, inflation was mild.
The department also said on Friday that the producer price index rose 0.5 percent in May from April. Gas prices rose 1.5 percent last month, and food costs increased 0.6 percent.
Confidence in the economy has fallen in June to a lower level than economists estimated, according to the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan survey.
Scott King, senior fiduciary investment adviser at Unified Trust in Lexington, Ky., said that investors were disappointed on Friday by the decline in consumer confidence. He described the economy as "plodding along."
"Wage growth continues to be pretty meager, and unemployment continues to be lackluster," Mr. King said.
The Federal Reserve said on Friday that factory production rose just 0.1 percent in May from April, a sign that manufacturing was providing little support for the economy. Output fell 0.4 percent in April and 0.3 percent in March.
Factories produced more autos, computers and wood products last month, offsetting declines in the production of furniture and primary metals.
Manufacturing output has risen 1.7 percent in the last 12 months.
"Manufacturers are still struggling to cope with the ongoing weakness of global demand," said Paul Dales, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics.
In wholesale prices, the increase last month came after a 0.7 percent decline in April and a 0.6 percent drop in March, both of which were driven by steep declines in gas prices.
Core prices, which exclude food and energy, rose 0.1 percent in May. That matches the April increase. The index measures price changes before they reach the consumer.
"There really is not much inflationary pressure in the economy," Mr. Dales said in a note to clients.
Aside from sharp swings in gas prices, consumer and wholesale inflation has increased very slowly in the last year. Both the overall and core indexes have risen just 1.7 percent in the 12 months ending in May. That is less than the Federal Reserve's 2 percent inflation target, allowing the Fed more latitude to pursue its aggressive policies to spur greater economic growth.
The combination of modest economic growth and high unemployment has kept wages from rising quickly, making it harder for retailers and other businesses to raise prices.
Most of the May increase in food costs stemmed from a 41.6 percent rise in the cost of eggs, the biggest on record. The increase reflected soaring demand in the United States and overseas. The Memorial Day and Mother's Day holidays, popular occasions for brunch, spurred more demand in the United States, a department spokesman said. And Mexico imported more eggs from the United States in response to a bird flu epidemic.
Nearly two-thirds of the 0.1 percent increase in core prices was caused by a 0.4 percent rise in the wholesale cost of pickup trucks. The housing recovery has created more business for landscapers and contractors, who have bought more trucks.

Abstract: The shift -- reflected in a rising demand for foods like poultry, pasta and pizza; a greater awareness of the health risks associated with eating beef; and even the emergence of an insurgent vegetarian dining scene in Buenos Aires -- does not sit well with some Argentines. At Buenos Aires Verde, a vegetarian restaurant with a pastel orange and lime green color scheme, diners can choose from options like patties made from yamani rice and adzuki beans, or cannelloni made with dehydrated fruit and flax seeds.

Full text:   BUENOS AIRES -- A thick slab of grass-fed sirloin dripping in its own juices: so many Argentines consider such a feast a birthright to be enjoyed regularly that one president in the 1990s quipped to an American magazine, "Tell your readers, 'Don't come to my country if they're vegetarian.' "
But tastes change, even here.
Beef consumption in this red-meat colossus has decreased so much over the decades that the nation recently fell from its perch as the world's top per capita consumer of beef, a title Argentine ranchers are fighting to regain from their tiny neighbor, Uruguay. In another jolt, a study warned that pizzerias could soon outnumber steakhouses in this city.
As if that were not enough to rattle the national psyche, Argentina slipped into 11th place, behind countries like New Zealand and Mexico, in the global ranking of beef exporters this year, prompting solemn reactions like one in a major newspaper that declared it "the end of a reign."
"We live, at this moment, immersed in shame," the writer Diego Vecino said in a recent 4,000-plus-word magazine article that explored declining beef consumption. "In the last few years, our Argentine national identity has been roughed up as never before," he lamented, in a slightly tongue-in-cheek fashion. "The ritual of the barbecue persists, but in many cases under the kitsch glow of a retro experience."
It is hard to overstate beef's centrality to the Argentine way of life for more than a century. Novels and poems extol the art of cattle ranching on the vast pampas, long a touchstone of national pride. Cafes in this city bulge with diners feasting on steaks washed down with glasses of malbec. At lunchtime, it is still possible to see construction crews preparing slabs of beef on makeshift grills, the smoky smell of this ritual permeating their work sites.
Argentines ate about 129 pounds of beef a person last year, far surpassing Americans, who mustered a mere 57.5 pounds by comparison. But Argentina's current level is a pale shadow of its peak: 222 pounds of beef for every man, woman and child, achieved in 1956.
Reasons vary for these doldrums. Beef prices have surged with inflation, but cattlemen contend that government price controls aimed at preventing domestic beef consumption from falling further have wreaked havoc by making it costly to maintain large herds. Others, eying China's rising demand for grains over the last decade, say it is simply more profitable to farm soybeans than to raise cattle.
"We are witnessing a historic decline in our beef industry," said Ernesto Ambrosetti, chief economist of the Argentine Rural Society, the country's largest farming association. "Now our smaller neighbors, Paraguay and Uruguay, have passed us" in the export rankings.
Government officials contend that their policies to lift beef consumption, including export restraints and price controls intended to make the meat more affordable, are turning the tide. Indeed, domestic consumption has recovered slightly from a record low in 2011.
But while Argentina has experienced swings in beef consumption in the past, some see the latest drops as evidence of a broader paradigm shift: many Argentines are simply opting for a more varied diet.
The shift -- reflected in a rising demand for foods like poultry, pasta and pizza; a greater awareness of the health risks associated with eating beef; and even the emergence of an insurgent vegetarian dining scene in Buenos Aires -- does not sit well with some Argentines.
"Beef consumption is threatened by modern trends of healthy eating, mainly the exaltation of what's natural and ecological, stimulating vegetable consumption," the Argentine Beef Promotion Institute warned in a 2006 report, warily acknowledging a "new age culture and the appearance of cooking fads incorporating other products."
For some Argentines who were raised in a society so focused on beef, the adjustment was long overdue. "I almost don't eat meat now," said Susana Carfagna, a 61-year-old retiree, as she walked out of a butcher shop with some ground chicken as an alternative to beef burgers. "It's not healthy. I have high cholesterol and need a more balanced diet."
At Buenos Aires Verde, a vegetarian restaurant with a pastel orange and lime green color scheme, diners can choose from options like patties made from yamani rice and adzuki beans, or cannelloni made with dehydrated fruit and flax seeds.
"Argentines are demanding a change," Mauro Massimino, 33, a vegetarian who owns the restaurant, said as his predominantly svelte clientele ate their meals. "Around five years ago, vegetarianism started to gain traction here, and the growth since has been incredible."
The growth of vegetarian restaurants in Argentina's capital has unfolded at a time of big change -- some say upheaval -- in the countryside. As recently as 2007, Argentina had about 55.6 million head of cattle, according to the United States Department of Agriculture. That number fell to 48.1 million in 2011, before recovering somewhat this year to an estimated 51.2 million. (That is still more cows than people, given the country's population of more than 40 million.)
As Argentina's economy over the past decade recovered from a collapse in 2001, beef prices in the country surged. Struggling with the broader increase in inflation, the authorities in 2006 announced a temporary ban on beef exports in an effort to expand the domestic supply and bring down prices for Argentine consumers.
Since then, the government has limited beef exports and imposed price controls, moves that ranchers claim are eroding profitability. As losses mounted, a wave of slaughterhouse shutdowns left thousands of people jobless in recent years. Many cattle ranchers have shifted into soybean farming, with the grain exported largely to China where it is used as animal feed.
The government has tried to curb the impact of rising beef prices and diminished supply through a program called "Meat for Everyone," offering more than a dozen popular cuts of beef at low prices to consumers in the Buenos Aires metro area.
But officials have also promoted other types of animal protein, reflecting the nation's dependence on agribusiness. "It is much more gratifying to eat some grilled pork than to take Viagra," President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner said in 2010, joking about what she described as the meat's libido-enhancing qualities while announcing subsidies for the pork industry.
For many Argentines, how much beef they eat comes down to another factor: price. In the last three years, coveted cuts of cuadril (rump steaks) have jumped in price almost 90 percent, to about $5.80 a pound, said Juan Pagano, a butcher in the neighborhood of Colegiales.
"It's unbelievable how the prices have shot up," said Eduardo González, 48, who cleans industrial water tanks for a living. Buying a relatively cheap and tough cut of beef one recent evening at a supermarket, he said he could no longer afford sirloin.
"But I still try to eat beef four times a week; if I did not, I would die!" he said, with a chuckle. "It is fundamental."
Indeed, many Argentines are not taking the decline of their beef industry lying down.
Claudia Valenti, a nutritionist for the municipality of Buenos Aires, said people should eat beef, preferably lean cuts, every day.
"We are not herbivores," Ms. Valenti said.
"Human beings never were, apart from at the very beginning of time."

Full text:   Amid the current turmoil in global markets, one question is being obsessively debated on Wall Street: Just what was Ben S. Bernanke thinking three weeks ago when he said that the Federal Reserve might soon cut back its stimulus efforts?
While second-guessing the Fed is a parlor game that traders have played for decades, it is an exercise that has taken on heightened significance. That is because in recent years, the markets have been more dependent on central bank support than at than any time in recent memory. So when Mr. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, said that the stimulus might diminish, alarm was bound to spread. And quite a reaction it was.
Since May 22, when Mr. Bernanke made those remarks, global stock markets have lost $3 trillion in value, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
The Japanese stock market, for example, lurched into bear-market territory on Thursday after a tumble of 6.4 percent took the cumulative decline in the Nikkei 225 index to more than 21 percent since a peak on May 22.
While sentiment has been fragile as investors have taken stock of the economic policies of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, markets in Europe and the United States have been volatile as well. Stocks rallied in the United States on Thursday, with the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rising 1.5 percent, but they have gyrated since Mr. Bernanke's remarks forced investors to consider a world with less Fed stimulus.
Mr. Bernanke will get another bite at the apple at a scheduled news conference next week and in his semiannual testimony to Congress next month, when his comments will be closely scrutinized.
Before looking at what Mr. Bernanke actually said in May, it is helpful to recall some history.
After the financial crisis of 2008, the Fed moved into emergency mode to lift the economy and support the banking system. The central bank has bought more than $2 trillion of bonds, effectively pumping that amount into the banking system and economy.
The Fed's latest bond purchase program kicked in this year. But in contrast to its previous programs, the Fed this time did not say in advance how much it was going to spend on bonds. Instead, the central bank said it would keep up its purchases until certain economic targets were achieved.
The main goal is to get the unemployment rate down to 6.5 percent or lower. The Fed is also watching the falling inflation rate and will keep buying bonds if that indicator falls to a level that it thinks will weaken the economy and financial system.
Looking at where those two gauges are today, investors assumed the Fed would buy bonds for many months. But that changed when Mr. Bernanke testified before Congress on May 22. He said that if the Fed saw improvement in the economy, and felt it could be sustained, it "could in the next few meetings take a step down in our pace of purchases."
The words "next few meetings" were what really worried market participants. They had become accustomed to the Fed's implacable reassurances that it wasn't going to change its accommodative stance until the goals had been met.
Yet here was Mr. Bernanke seemingly saying that the money spigot could start closing later this year. Their thought process continued: Mr. Bernanke must know how much weight his words carry, and he always speaks very carefully to avoid upsetting the apple cart, so his utterance must have been deliberate and must have had a motive.
Here are four theories going around Wall Street on why the Fed chairman said what he said:
A BONE FOR THE HAWKSAccording to Fed observers, Mr. Bernanke has a consensual style of management on the all-important Fed committee that sets monetary policy. Some members have deep reservations about the large bond purchases. Mr. Bernanke doesn't agree with the hawks, but he wants them to feel that their concerns are listened to.
So he makes an utterance that proves to them that he is not afraid to publicly envision a definite end to the stimulus. They then feel comforted that Helicopter Ben will have the resolve to stop the money drop -- one day. This theory is great for the camp that thinks the Fed must keep pressing the gas. It means Mr. Bernanke was merely being a shrewd manager and isn't going to turn stingy any time soon.
BURSTING BUBBLES The Fed has a frighteningly poor record of spotting bubbles and deflating them before they become destructive. There is no gigantic, overarching bubble right now that could harm the wider economy. But over the last two years, as the Fed has pumped money into the financial system, large markets have been driven higher by significant amounts of speculation.
A Fed governor, Jeremy C. Stein, has highlighted the risks in some of them. On Wall Street, with interest rates this low for so long, it has become easy to make bets with borrowed money. But such investments can unwind violently with even the slightest tightening of credit. Mr. Bernanke may have wanted to throw a little bit of sand into this giant leverage machine.
If so, it seems to have worked so far, because some of the frothiest markets have tumbled since his testimony. From the Fed's perspective, the risk is that the sell-off builds on itself and weighs on the wider economy.
DRESS REHEARSALOne day the Fed will clearly state that it truly is going to pare its purchases. That could usher in a turbulent period in the markets. Talking about such withdrawal today could soften any shock it inflicts on the market when it happens. It is the same reason parents prepare children for their first day of school during the summer.
"You could see this as a trial balloon that was floated," said Brian Smith, who trades bonds at TCW, an asset management firm. "Bernanke might have wanted to see if the market could handle a tapering."
The Fed also gets to examine exactly how the markets reacted and can make tailored responses. In recent weeks, some important assets have been acting in weirdly interconnected ways (just search Google for the term "convexity vortex"). The Fed is now wiser about those sorts of moves.
A TAP ON THE BRAKESThe final theory is that Mr. Bernanke has in fact shifted his stance. While certainly not a hawk, he has intellectually moved closer to ending the asset purchases than people might realize. It is important to remember that the latest open-ended program was conceived at the end of last year, when there was great trepidation about the drag that fiscal retrenchment would have on the economy.
"Back in December, the Fed didn't know if we would fall off the fiscal cliff," said David Rosenberg, chief economist at Gluskin Sheff & Associates. "So it may have thought, 'We'll shoot now and think later.' "
It turns out that, in spite of Washington's budget battles, the economy has been quite resilient. For the economic conditions that exist right now, smaller purchases may be more appropriate. Some economists dispute this line of thinking.
For instance, they say the Fed isn't going to taper when the inflation rate is declining as it is right now. But Mr. Bernanke may think that dip is temporary, particularly since some forward-looking indicators in the markets predict a rise in inflation. And some economists see strong signs that the latest round of bond purchases is having its desired effect and will lead to a stronger economy as early as the second half of this year.
When faced with frantic speculation over its motives, and weakening markets, the Fed may be tempted to say things to calm everyone down. So far, the most influential Fed governors have not come out to somehow correct people's interpretations of Mr. Bernanke's remarks. That could work to the good of everyone.
"Although the last three weeks have been jarring to everyone -- including the Fed -- its prime directive is to get policy correct, not worry about several weeks of increased market volatility," said Jim Vogel, a debt markets strategist for FTN Financial.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The world economy will face slower but less volatile growth in the coming months and years, the World Bank forecast on Wednesday, as dire risks from the financial crisis in Europe fade and emerging economies confront new challenges adapting to softer commodity prices and the prospect of rising interest rates.
"There's a growing recognition that this is not the aftereffect of the crisis," Andrew Burns, the lead author of the report, said in an interview. "It is a new normal."
All in all, the bank's economists forecast that the global economy will grow about 2.2 percent this year and 3 percent in 2014 in the latest periodic update to its Global Economic Prospects report. That is slightly weaker growth than the World Bank forecast in January.
The report's authors said they expected sluggish growth from high-income countries, with the euro area remaining weak but finally emerging from recession and Japan gaining some momentum from the government's aggressive fiscal and monetary measures after a decade of malaise and stagnation. The bank raised its estimate of 2013 growth for Japan to 1.4 percent from its earlier prediction of 0.8 percent.
The United States is expected to be relatively strong among the world's rich nations. Even so, the World Bank, which is responsible for encouraging development around the globe, anticipates that the American economy will grow only about 2 percent this year, in line with its performance over the last three years.
For emerging economies, conditions vary widely, the report said, but the picture is broadly good. Across large parts of Latin America, East Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, countries are growing close to their potential capacities, tied to factors like increases in productivity and the working-age population, and should expect little acceleration in the coming years, the report said.
In many cases, that means growing more slowly than during the expansion that preceded the global financial crisis. But those lower levels of growth might be more durable and sustainable, the report's authors said.
Policy makers should focus on their individual domestic challenges, like improving infrastructure, streamlining regulations and rebuilding fiscal buffers that were thinned during the crisis. Officials in some countries, like Thailand and Ethiopia, should remain vigilant for signs of overheating and bubbles, the bank said.
"The slower growth is not really an issue of a big change in the fundamentals," Mr. Burns said. "But the very strong growth in the precrisis period was above capacity, and we're moving into a period where growth is more in line with underlying capacity. That can be a bit of a frustrating thing for developing countries."
In Eastern Europe, the Middle East and North Africa, economies remain fragile and in some cases deeply troubled, the report said. Countries in Eastern and Central Europe, still emerging from the post-Soviet era, in many cases suffer from the same problems as countries in high-income Europe. These include fragile banking sectors, credit problems and large budget deficits. Still, growth should pick up in developing Europe to more than 4 percent in 2015 from about 2.7 percent last year.
The Middle Eastern and North African region continues to struggle with political instability. Growth might pick up as tensions ease, the bank said.
The world economy is undergoing a fundamentally positive realignment, Mr. Burns said, as developing economies become more reliant on themselves and one another for new demand. Now, more than half of developing-country trade occurs with other developing countries, rather than with richer nations like the United States and Japan, the report said. That is up from 37 percent in 2001.
The trend is not just about China, either, the bank emphasized, though it buys 26 percent of its exports from developing countries, compared with 14 percent in 2001. "Growth of trade between the remaining developing countries has also outpaced trade with high-income countries by a wide margin," the report said.
There is a new risk from the United States and other high-income economies, however: the end of extremely accommodating monetary policy. The scaling back of the Federal Reserve's policy of quantitative easing, for instance, might lead to higher interest rates around the world, the report noted.
Businesses in many countries have eagerly taken advantage of low rates to embark on major projects relying on longer-term loans, like construction projects. That has created conditions ripe for higher losses from loans that no longer make sense if interest rates rise and demand eases.
"Higher interest rates will increase debt-servicing costs and could increase default rates on existing loans," the bank warned. "Banks in countries that have enjoyed very strong growth and asset-price inflation, together with high levels of government or private sector debt, may be at particular risk."
There were no obvious signs of risk in specific emerging economies, Mr. Burns said, though conditions seemed to indicate that financial bubbles could be developing. "We won't know who's swimming naked until the tide goes out," Mr. Burns said.
Developing countries also may need to adjust to lower commodity prices as global growth slows in the postcrisis period, bank economists said.
"Over the last four years, developing economies have become very accustomed to high commodity prices related to the real economy," said Hans Timmer, the director of the development prospects group at the bank. But higher prices helped increase supply, and demand might slow down. "We're postcrisis, postrecovery, and we're having new discussions."

Abstract: Had the corn been planted on time, the pollination would have occurred earlier in the summer, when temperatures are not usually as high. Because of the late planting, the U.S.D.A. did reduce its forecast for corn production by 135 million bushels from last month's report.

Full text:   KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- The government is predicting record corn and soybean yields this year despite intense spring showers that have delayed planting, damaged crops already in the ground and prevented farmers from sowing all of their seeds. But the projections are based on estimates made before the heavy rains came about how many acres of crops will be planted.
The Department of Agriculture, in a report released on Wednesday, estimated that 14 billion bushels of corn will be produced this year, a forecast that, if it holds true, would crush the previous record of 13.1 billion set four years ago. The World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates report also forecast that a record 3.39 billion bushels of soybeans would be harvested.
The projections assume that 97.3 million acres of corn and 77.1 million acres of soybeans will be planted this year -- estimates that the department gathered during a survey of farmers this year. Analysts expect that fewer acres will actually be planted. The department will conduct another survey this month and release more accurate planting numbers at the end of the month.
"The projections are still highly tentative," Joseph W. Glauber, the U.S.D.A.'s chief economist, wrote in an e-mail.
As of Monday, about 4.5 million acres of corn and 22 million acres of soybeans remained unplanted, according to Christopher A. Hurt, an agricultural economist at Purdue University. By this time last year, all of the nation's corn crop had already been planted.
Record rainfall and flooding across vast swaths of the Farm Belt this spring mucked up fields, keeping many farmers from getting out with their heavy farm equipment to sow crops. Many reported that they planted their corn about a month later than usual this spring, and some said they had yet to plant any of their soybeans.
The late planting of corn could hurt the crops' health because they may not pollinate until late July or August, when temperatures are typically at their peak. Hot weather thwarts the pollination process, which could prevent corn plants from producing their normal yields. Had the corn been planted on time, the pollination would have occurred earlier in the summer, when temperatures are not usually as high.
Because of the late planting, the U.S.D.A. did reduce its forecast for corn production by 135 million bushels from last month's report. Still, agriculture experts say they expect the production numbers to come down even more.
"Anybody around the Midwest knows those numbers, they're not right," Professor Hurt said.
But even a moderate decrease in the U.S.D.A.'s current projections would still mean a much more bountiful crop than last year, when one of the most widespread droughts in the nation's history led to a harvest of about 10.8 billion bushels.
Last year's poor production leaves a lot of room for improvement this year, which could translate into an ease on commodity prices.
"It still looks like a reasonable crop," Professor Hurt said. "That's going to keep us from having extraordinarily high prices, as we had from the 2012 crop. This is going to be beneficial in terms of our basic food supplies and our basic inflation in our food."

Full text:   TOKYO -- The Bank of Japan held its policy steady on Tuesday, brushing off recent market volatility and standing by an ambitious target to stoke 2 percent inflation in two years, despite skepticism from within its own ranks over how quickly it can lift Japan's economy out of its long deflationary slump.
Stock market reaction was swift and negative. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 stock index fell almost 200 points, or 1.5 percent, marking another day of turbulent trade. European stocks picked up the pace, with the Euro Stoxx 50 down 2.1 percent in afternoon trading. Wall Street stock indexes opened with a loss of about 1 percent.
David Hussey, head of European equities at Manulife Asset Management in London, said the equities drop was the result of concern about the potential end of economic stimulus in general.
"People are worried that the Fed would taper off quantitative easing," Mr. Hussey said about the United States Federal Reserve board. "It could go wrong if they do it too early, but I think at some point that stimulus will have to come off as the economy is starting its healing process. and that ought to be a good thing."
In a unanimous vote at the end of a two-day policy meeting, the Bank of Japan's board decided to stay pat on a policy to grow its base money, or the cash and deposits the bank holds, by between 60 trillion yen and 70 trillion yen a year ($600 billion to $700 billion a year), which in turn increases the funds that flow through the Japanese economy and encourages companies to borrow and invest.
The bank also raised its assessment of the Japanese economy, saying Japan's economy was "picking up," a slight improvement over its appraisal last month that the economy was "starting to pick up." The brighter outlook came after revised government data showed Japan's economy grew at a rate of 1.0 percent between January and March, faster than a preliminary estimate of 0.9 percent, due to stronger corporate capital and household spending
"Japan's economy is expected to return to a moderate recovery path" thanks to resilient domestic demand and the effects of its aggressive monetary easing program, the bank said in a statement.
Since April, the Bank of Japan has embarked on monetary stimulus of an unprecedented scale in a bid to jolt the Japanese economy out of 15 years of deflation, part of a wider economic growth push introduced by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
Under Haruhiko Kuroda, its new governor, the central bank pledged to double Japan's money supply in two years through aggressive purchases of government bonds and other assets. It also committed to a target to hit 2 percent inflation over the next two years, a goal that some economists say is overly ambitious in a country that has seen prices fall for 15 years.
In a sign of faltering confidence, one board member, Takahide Kiuchi, proposed replacing that two-year target with a less ambitious commitment to achieving 2 percent inflation "in the medium to long term." That proposal was voted down by the other eight members on the bank's policy board, according to the bank's statement.
"It's true that the road to 2 percent will be long," Mr. Kuroda said at a news conference following the decision. To get there, he said, other facets of Prime Minister Abe's economic growth program needed to kick in, bringing about a rebound in jobs, wages and demand. "Once the entire economy enters a positive cycle, we will see prices stabilize at 2 percent," he said, adding that for now, the bank's policy push was "on track."
The central bank also held off from introducing measures to keep down Japan's long-term interest rates, a move expected by some economists ahead of the meeting.
Yields on benchmark 10-year government bonds spiked in late May as prices of those bonds slumped, causing investor jitters over Japan's ability to keep funding, and servicing, its colossal public debt. Those fears helped end a spectacular rally in the Japanese stock market this year and brought several weeks of volatile trading.
One measure floated by economists that might calm investor nerves had been to extend a low-interest loan program that would make it easier for financial institutions to buy government bonds even if interest rates started rising. But that runs counter to the bank's goal of shifting corporate investment out of low-interest bonds to higher-yielding equities and borrowing.
Mr. Kuroda said that the board had discussed such measures, but ultimately decided fresh steps were unnecessary for the time being. He has said that the recent rise in long-term interest rates is a healthy reflection of inflation expectations, and does not pose an immediate threat to the Japanese economy.
He stressed that the bank has had a measure of success in reducing volatility in bond markets by conducting its bond purchases more frequently, in smaller amounts. He said that the bank would sustain those efforts, and would watch financial markets closely.
"We continue to be wary of movements in long-term interest rates, especially undesirable spikes in volatility, and will keep up efforts to reduce that volatility," he said. "But the economy is on a solid path to recovery, and I expect financial markets to soon reflect that, and regain composure."

What's Next for Social Security?

Abstract: [...]even though Social Security is not a cause of today's deficits, they would rather cut benefits than improve the system's finances by imposing tax increases on higher-income taxpayers or phasing in a modest payroll tax increase over decades.

Full text:   The trustees of Social Security recently reported that the retirement system can pay full benefits until 2035, when it will be able to pay about three-fourths of promised benefits. That is not a crisis. It is a manageable problem.
The system needs to be restored to long-term health, but policy makers must realize that broad-based benefit cuts are not really a viable option. For most people, the ability to finance a secure retirement has been ruined by stagnating wages, repeated stock market busts, diminished home equity and weakened or nonexistent pensions. Social Security, whose average monthly retirement benefit is $1,268, is pretty much all that is left. Most people age 65 and older get two-thirds to all of their income from Social Security.
And yet, in the deficit-obsessed, anti-tax world of Washington, closing the shortfall in Social Security has come to mean broadly cutting benefits. That would be a mistake. Targeted cuts -- like lower payouts for upper-income recipients who live longer and draw larger benefits -- could improve the system's finances and fairness.
But those who promote across-the-board cuts are not interested in strengthening the system. They want to reduce the budget deficit. And even though Social Security is not a cause of today's deficits, they would rather cut benefits than improve the system's finances by imposing tax increases on higher-income taxpayers or phasing in a modest payroll tax increase over decades.
The focus on benefit cuts also conveniently ignores the fact that benefits are already shrinking. Under current law, benefits are being reduced by the higher retirement age, which has been gradually rising from 65 to 67 for those born in 1960 or later. That translates into lower monthly benefits for those who retire at 65 or fewer years of benefits for those who work until 67. For example, a worker entitled to a $1,000 monthly benefit upon retirement at age 67 will get only $867 if he or she retires at 65.
Benefit checks are also being reduced by higher Medicare Part B premiums, which are deducted from Social Security benefits. The premiums are set to rise from 5 percent of benefits, on average, for those retiring in 2002 to 9.5 percent for those retiring in 2030. And if you factor in rising co-payments on health care services, most retirees already face living on less.
Taxes further erode benefit payments because the levels at which benefits become taxable -- generally, $25,000 for individuals and $32,000 for couples -- have never been adjusted for wage growth or inflation. By 2030, more than half of recipients will owe tax on a portion of their benefits, compared with 10 percent when the taxes were first imposed, in 1984.
The upshot is that under current law, Social Security benefits will replace 31 percent of the typical retiree's preretirement earnings in 2030, compared with 42 percent as recently as 2004, according to the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College. And that includes only the big reductions. Benefits are also smaller because of changes instituted in 1983 that permanently delayed all retirees' first cost-of-living adjustment for six months. A misguided plan by the Obama administration to cut the COLA as part of a deficit reduction package would add to that cutback.
Social Security benefit cuts are already well under way, and they cannot go much further. Reform should balance cuts with tax increases, including raising the level of wages subject to payroll tax. It should also include a plan to create good jobs and foster immigration, bolstering the income and number of workers paying into the system. There are sensible ways to fix Social Security without undermining it as a support against hardship in old age.

Full text:   I've been in this economics business for a while. In fact, I've been in it so long I still remember what people considered normal in those long-ago days before the financial crisis. Normal, back then, meant an economy adding a million or more jobs each year, enough to keep up with the growth in the working-age population. Normal meant an unemployment rate not much above 5 percent, except for brief recessions. And while there was always some unemployment, normal meant very few people out of work for extended periods.
So how, in those long-ago days, would we have reacted to Friday's news that the number of Americans with jobs is still down two million from six years ago, that 7.6 percent of the work force is unemployed (with many more underemployed or forced to take low-paying jobs), and that more than four million of the unemployed have been out of work for more than six months? Well, we know how most political insiders reacted: they called it a pretty good jobs report. In fact, some are even celebrating the report as "proof" that the budget sequester isn't doing any harm.
In other words, our policy discourse is still a long way from where it ought to be.
For more than three years some of us have fought the policy elite's damaging obsession with budget deficits, an obsession that led governments to cut investment when they should have been raising it, to destroy jobs when job creation should have been their priority. That fight seems largely won -- in fact, I don't think I've ever seen anything quite like the sudden intellectual collapse of austerity economics as a policy doctrine.
But while insiders no longer seem determined to worry about the wrong things, that's not enough; they also need to start worrying about the right things -- namely, the plight of the jobless and the immense continuing waste from a depressed economy. And that's not happening. Instead, policy makers both here and in Europe seem gripped by a combination of complacency and fatalism, a sense that nothing need be done and nothing can be done. Call it the big shrug.
Even the people I consider the good guys, policy makers who have in the past shown real concern over our economic weakness, aren't showing much sense of urgency these days. For example, last fall some of us were greatly encouraged by the Federal Reserve's announcement that it was instituting new measures to bolster the economy. Policy specifics aside, the Fed seemed to be signaling its willingness to do whatever it took to get unemployment down. Lately, however, what one mostly hears from the Fed is talk of "tapering," of letting up on its efforts, even though inflation is below target, the employment situation is still terrible and the pace of improvement is glacial at best.
And Fed officials are, as I said, the good guys. Sometimes it seems as if nobody in Washington outside the Fed even considers high unemployment a problem.
Why isn't reducing unemployment a major policy priority? One answer may be that inertia is a powerful force, and it's hard to get policy changes absent the threat of disaster. As long as we're adding jobs, not losing them, and unemployment is basically stable or falling, not rising, policy makers don't feel any urgent need to act.
Another answer is that the unemployed don't have much of a political voice. Profits are sky-high, stocks are up, so things are O.K. for the people who matter, right?
A third answer is that while we aren't hearing so much these days from the self-styled deficit hawks, the monetary hawks -- economists, politicians and officials who keep warning that low interest rates will have dire consequences -- have, if anything, gotten even more vociferous. It doesn't seem to matter that the monetary hawks, like the fiscal hawks, have an impressive record of being wrong about everything (where's that runaway inflation they promised?). They just keep coming back; the arguments change (now they're warning about asset bubbles), but the policy demand -- tighter money and higher interest rates -- is always the same. And it's hard to escape the sense that the Fed is being intimidated into inaction.
The tragedy is that it's all unnecessary. Yes, you hear talk about a "new normal" of much higher unemployment, but all the reasons given for this alleged new normal, such as the supposed mismatch between workers' skills and the demands of the modern economy, fall apart when subjected to careful scrutiny. If Washington would reverse its destructive budget cuts, if the Fed would show the "Rooseveltian resolve" that Ben Bernanke demanded of Japanese officials back when he was an independent economist, we would quickly discover that there's nothing normal or necessary about mass long-term unemployment.
So here's my message to policy makers: Where we are is not O.K. Stop shrugging, and do your jobs.

Full text:   SOCIAL SECURITY is expected to run out of reserves by 2033 -- a mere 20 years from now. With the public apparently opposed both to tax increases and to benefit cuts, the main politically feasible way to avoid such a fate seems to involve some monkeying with obscure aspects of the definition of benefits.
Congress seems to want a ruse to disguise a cut in benefits as something else -- like the discovery of a technical error that, once corrected, would let the government write smaller checks without taking the blame for cutting benefits.
In a spirit of compromise, President Obama has proposed changing how inflation is measured in benefit calculations. In his 2014 budget proposal released in April, he proposed that retirees' Social Security benefits be indexed to something called the Chained Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers or C-CPI-U, rather than the current benchmark, the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, or CPI-W.
This seems to correct a real technical error. Economists have argued that the current index overstates the actual inflation rate, and that a switch to the C-CPI-U would make the inflation indexing more accurate, seemingly justifying the resulting gradual reduction in benefits. (And it would be a reduction, to the point that someone retiring today would be receiving about 5 percent less in 20 years.)
But here is the rub: the proposal solves the wrong problem and, in doing so, undermines the integrity of the Social Security system.
The purpose of Social Security is to help families. It reinforces the intergenerational sharing that families already -- though imperfectly -- provide. It helps retirees by stabilizing their income, and it helps their grown children, who are relieved of any excessive burden of supporting them. This purpose strongly suggests that the Social Security benefits should be indexed to some measure of the available, aggregate economic pie. That means a formula that looks completely different from the ones being discussed today.
Clearly, something needs to be done: if nothing changes, and the trust fund runs out in 2033, the system would be able to pay only about 75 percent of promised benefits.
The issues are complex, as economic theorists like Henning Bohn at the University of California, Santa Barbara, have shown. But now that an index change is on the table, we should take this opportunity to get it right.
One alternative that we should consider is a different kind of index switch, linking retirees' benefits to gross domestic product per capita, in current dollars. This measure responds to inflation just as the C-CPI-U does, but, in contrast, it also responds to changes in the nation's resources, as measured by real G.D.P. There could also be corrections for other factors, like the dependency ratio, which compares the number of "dependents" (retired people and children) to the number of working adults.
Such an index switch, however, has received hardly any public discussion, and that fact alone will make some people think that something is wrong with it. But political talk is limited; it is too focused on the identified problem of somehow fixing the projected Social Security insolvency. While this new idea won't solve insolvency -- we may need to raise Social Security contributions to do that -- it would support the principle that one generation shouldn't be more burdened than another.
Before 1972, Social Security wasn't indexed at all, and there was little public talk about tying it to inflation despite periodic, inflation-induced disasters for retirees. Congress simply made occasional, ad hoc, upward adjustments in the benefit formula. Proponents of these adjustments often justified the increases as offsetting the rising cost of living. But at the same time, they also described retirees as needy, suffering hardships and deserving dignity. While there were no explicit references to G.D.P., it's plausible that their sense of "needy" was influenced by comparison with the rising American standard of living for working adults. As a matter of fact, total Social Security benefits more than kept up with the rapid G.D.P. growth in the couple of decades before they were indexed to inflation.
Now that inflation indexing has been in place, some people see the formula as always providing the scientifically "right" amount of benefits. They don't think much about other factors that might enter into the determination of benefits. And, in fact, since 1982, Social Security benefits as a fraction of G.D.P. have generally been falling, at least until the latest recession.
The fact is that per capita G.D.P., in current dollars, has grown 1.2 percent faster a year, on average, than the CPI-W in the last 20 years, despite the Great Recession. If we indexed Social Security benefits to G.D.P. per capita, and not to the C-CPI-U, people who retire today and live 20 additional years would get a third more in real, inflation-corrected benefits -- provided, of course, that the next 20 years are like the last.
If the economy grew unusually rapidly, however, they might get 50 or 60 percent more, in real terms. But even that wouldn't break the budget of the Social Security system, because contributions would be higher, too, in response to the greater economic growth. And if the economy stagnated in a deep depression in the next 20 years, retirees might see no growth at all, or conceivably even a decline, in real terms. That's O.K., too, because everyone else would be suffering as well. We have other programs, like Medicare, that deal with any extreme hardships that some older Americans with special conditions might encounter.
THE point of G.D.P. indexing is to align the interests of the retired with society as a whole. Older Americans should share both the windfalls and the losses with other generations -- with working adults, and with children. It shouldn't be otherwise. If the system's rules force us to maintain the real benefits of retirees at all costs, we may find ourselves, in difficult times, taking excessively from our children via cuts in education, or from our working adults. Why should retired people feel no effect at all from the recession while younger people are left suffering? They should be sharing the hardships, if we have familial feelings for one another.
The issue is especially salient today because the demographics have shifted: the aging of the baby boomers will create many retirees relative to adults who are still working. This huge shift could not have been foreseen by Social Security's designers.
Achieving the right benefit formula while fixing Social Security's solvency problem might require increasing the contribution rate -- now in the form of 6.2 percent taxes on employees and employers. But so be it. We need to say what is right, keeping our eyes on the integrity of Social Security, which is crucial to our identity as a civil society.

Abstract: The topsy-turvy world of today's financial markets -- particularly, the still-ultralow interest rates in the bond market -- is upending what many people thought they understood about how to pay for life after work. "The probabilities are remarkably grim for retirees who insist on holding only bonds in the belief that they are safe," says Seth J. Masters, the chief investment officer of Bernstein Global Wealth Management, a Manhattan-based firm, which ran these projections for Sunday Business. "Because we live in this world we tend to think of it as 'normal,' but from the standpoint of financial market history, it's not normal at all," Mr. Masters said.

Full text:   A MILLION dollars isn't what it used to be.
In 1953, when "How to Marry a Millionaire" was in movie theaters, $1 million bought the equivalent of $8.7 million today. Now $1 million won't even buy an average Manhattan apartment or come remotely close to paying the average salary of an N.B.A. basketball player.
Still, $1 million is more money than 9 in 10 American families possess. It may no longer be a symbol of boundless wealth, but as a retirement nest egg, $1 million is relatively big. It may seem like a lot to live on.
But in many ways, it's not.
Inflation isn't the only thing that's whittled down the $1 million. The topsy-turvy world of today's financial markets -- particularly, the still-ultralow interest rates in the bond market -- is upending what many people thought they understood about how to pay for life after work.
"We're facing a crisis right now, and it's going to get worse," said Alicia Munnell, director of the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College. "Most people haven't saved nearly enough, not even people who have put away $1 million."
For people close to retirement, the problem is acute. The conventional financial advice is that the older you get, the more you should put into bonds, which are widely considered safer than stocks. But consider this bleak picture: A typical 65-year-old couple with $1 million in tax-free municipal bonds want to retire. They plan to withdraw 4 percent of their savings a year -- a common, rule-of-thumb drawdown. But under current conditions, if they spend that $40,000 a year, adjusted for inflation, there is a 72 percent probability that they will run through their bond portfolio before they die.
Suddenly, that risk-free bond portfolio is looking risky. "The probabilities are remarkably grim for retirees who insist on holding only bonds in the belief that they are safe," says Seth J. Masters, the chief investment officer of Bernstein Global Wealth Management, a Manhattan-based firm, which ran these projections for Sunday Business. "Because we live in this world we tend to think of it as 'normal,' but from the standpoint of financial market history, it's not normal at all," Mr. Masters said. "And that's very clear when you look at fixed-income returns."
Several rounds of intervention by the Federal Reserve and other central banks, aimed at stimulating a moribund economy, have helped to suppress rates, and so has low inflation. Low rates have led to cheaper mortgages and credit cards, helping to balance family budgets.
But for savers, low rates have been a trial. The fundamental problem is that benchmark Treasury yields have been well below 4 percent since early in the financial crisis. That creates brutal math: if your portfolio's income is below 4 percent, you can't withdraw 4 percent annually, and add inflation adjustments, without depleting that portfolio over time.
And with rising life expectancies, many people will have a lot of time: the average 65-year-old woman today can be expected to live to 86, a man to 84. One out of 10 people who are 65 today will live past 95, according to projections from the Social Security Administration.
"If you're invested only in bonds and you're withdrawing 4 percent, plus inflation, your portfolio will decline," said Maria A. Bruno, senior investment analyst at Vanguard. "That's why we recommend that most people hold some equities. And why it's important to be flexible." In some years, investors may need to withdraw less than 4 percent, she said, and in some years they can take more.
Clearly, such flexibility depends on individual circumstances. Billionaires can afford to be very flexible: just 2 percent of a $1 billion portfolio is still $20 million. With economizing, even a big spender should be able to scrape by on that. But $20,000 -- the cash flow from a $1 million portfolio at 2 percent -- won't take you very far in the United States today.
And if you're not close to being a millionaire -- if you're starting, say, with $10,000 in financial assets -- you've got very little flexibility indeed. Yet $10,890 is the median financial net worth of an American household today, according to calculations by Edward N. Wolff, an economics professor at New York University. (He bases this estimate on 2010 Federal Reserve data, which he has updated for Sunday Business according to changes in relevant market indexes.)
A millionaire household lives in elite territory, even if it no longer seems truly rich. Including a home in the calculations, such a family ranks in the top 10.1 percent of all households in the United States, according to Professor Wolff's estimates. Excluding the value of a home, a net worth of $1 million puts a household in the top 8.1 percent. Yet even such families may have difficulty maintaining their standard of living in retirement.
"The bottom line is that people at nearly all levels of the income distribution have undersaved," Professor Wolff said. "Social Security is going to be a major, and maybe primary, source of income for people, even for some of those close to the top."
Professor Munnell said that in addition to relying on Social Security, which she called "absolutely crucial, even for people with $1 million," other options include saving more, spending less, working longer and tapping home equity for living expenses. "There aren't that many levers we can use," she said. "We have to consider them all."
THE bond market has always been a forbidding place for outsiders, but making some sense of it is important for people who rely on bond income.
Low bond yields have been a nightmare for many investors, but that's not the only issue. Today's market rates aren't stable. Steve Huber, portfolio manager at T. Rowe Price, said, "Current yields are an anomaly when you consider where rates have been over the last decade or more."
Rates are expected to rise. While that will eventually mean more income for bond buyers, it will create a host of problems. Already, the market has been rattled by speculation that after years of big bond-buying, the Fed may soon begin to taper its appetite. In May, a half-point climb in the yield of 10-year Treasury notes produced the biggest monthly bond market losses in nine years. (Yields and prices move in opposite directions.) Yet yields remain extraordinarily low on a historical basis. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note is just under 2.2 percent, compared with more than 6.5 percent, on average, since 1962, according to quarterly Bloomberg data.
And bond investing is likely to remain challenging for years to come. Investors may face a double-whammy -- low yields now and the prospect of significant losses as yields rise. On Friday, after the Labor Department reported that the unemployment rate edged up to 7.6 percent from 7.5 percent, yields rose further, amid uncertainty about the Fed's intentions.
Despite this market instability, bonds tend to be the investment of choice as people retire, because they throw off steady income. But as the projections from Bernstein Global Wealth Management suggest, over-reliance on bonds leads to financial quandaries.
These projections, based on proprietary market and economic forecasts and portfolio analyses, as well as on standard actuarial and tax data, estimate future probabilities for investors. That's a quixotic task at best, intended to illustrate possible outcomes rather than to provide precise forecasts, said Mr. Masters at Bernstein.
Still, they are worrisome. Consider again the 65-year-old couple who are starting to draw down $1 million in savings this year: if they withdrew 3 percent, or $30,000, a year, rather than that standard rate of 4 percent, inflation-adjusted, there is still a one-in-three chance that they will outlive their money, under current market conditions.
There are ways to improve these outcomes, but they have their own hazards. Adding stocks to a portfolio is an obvious counterbalance. And there is now a broad consensus among asset managers and academics that stocks have an unusually high likelihood of outperforming bonds over the next decade. That was the finding of a recent study by two economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
The Bernstein projections concur that adding stocks to a portfolio reduces the risk of outliving your savings. But it also increases the risk of big losses.
Assume, for example, a diversified portfolio that is 80 percent invested in stocks and 20 percent in bonds -- a much higher stock-to-bond ratio than advisers typically suggest for someone near retirement. In that situation, under current market conditions and at a 4 percent withdrawal rate, the probability of running out of money drops to 14 percent. That's mainly because of higher expected returns for stocks. At a 3 percent withdrawal rate, the probability of outliving the portfolio is only 4 percent.
But then stock market risk comes into play. Over the long term, stocks tend to outperform bonds, but typically fluctuate much more wildly. There's a good chance that at some point, stock investments will produce major losses that many people simply can't tolerate.
"We find that people tend to think of losses in their portfolios based on the peak value they've ever had," Mr. Masters said. So Bernstein calculates the probability of what it calls a "peak-to-trough loss" of at least 20 percent in its sample portfolios.
For those with an 80/20 mix of stocks and bonds, it found a 60 percent probability of such a loss over the investors' lifetime. And, of course, some market declines far exceed 20 percent.
"Large losses may not be something that people are willing to live with, even if they are associated with higher returns over the long term," Mr. Masters said. "Which is why we'd recommend holding some stocks, but not as much as 80 percent, for most people."
Bonds would fare better in an economic environment more typical of the past, with higher interest rates, among other factors, Bernstein projections show. Should those conditions return one day, investment choices would be less stark. Under "normal" conditions, Bernstein projects, at a 4 percent withdrawal rate, inflation-adjusted, a portfolio 100 percent invested in bonds would have a 38 percent chance of running out in an investor's lifetime; at a 3 percent withdrawal rate, the chances drop to 14 percent.
Other investment companies modeling similar problems come up with different numbers, although the broad implications are reasonably close. "We're operating in the same ballpark," said Ms. Bruno at Vanguard.
T. Rowe Price projections -- which don't differentiate between current conditions and a historically normal environment -- include different stock and bond indexes, and don't include the effect of taxes. That outlook finds that a 65-year-old couple who invested entirely in bonds have a 21 percent chance of outliving their portfolio. That's much more favorable than the Bernstein projections.
Still, Jim Tzitzouris, quantitative analyst at the asset allocation group of T. Rowe Price, said, "In the current environment, it's worth being quite concerned about the effects of low interest rates on a retirement portfolio."
ASIDE from recalibrating a portfolio, what can be done to improve a would-be retiree's financial situation? One answer is to work longer and retire later. Yet many people can't do that, often because they are physically unable to do so or can no longer find a suitable job.
Still, the expectation of working longer seems to be the trend. An annual survey for the Employee Benefit Research Institute found that in 1991, only 11 percent of workers expected to retire after age 65, while this year, 36 percent said they would retire after 65 -- and 7 percent said they didn't plan to retire at all.
Working longer improves your financial prospects, and one reason is morbid: you won't have as long to live on your savings.
Working longer helps in a happier way, too. Professor Munnell notes that by delaying retirement, monthly Social Security benefits rise substantially. For example, if you delay claiming benefits past what the government calls your "full" retirement age -- 66, for people retiring this year -- your monthly benefits increase by 8 percent a year until you reach 70.
Compared with current bond yields, that's a fabulous rate of return, for people who can afford to delay starting the Social Security income stream, she said.
It's also a much better return than a commercially available annuity will provide. Vanguard estimates that a basic fixed annuity that ends at death will produce an annual inflation-adjusted payout of only 3.7 percent if bought today for a healthy 65-year-old couple. (But the money is definitely gone when they die; there would be no surplus to pass on, as there could be in an investment portfolio.)
Paying close attention to Social Security benefits is likely to be meaningful for retirees at nearly all income levels, Professor Wolff said. "Even at the millionaire level, for most people, Social Security is going to be very important."
The maximum Social Security benefit for a retiree at 66 this year is $31,000 -- about the equivalent of drawing down 3 percent a year on a portfolio of $1 million.
Still, even $61,000 or $71,000 a year -- the combined Social Security and cash flow from the $1 million portfolio -- isn't likely to be enough for most people who have grown accustomed to living on $150,000 or more a year. And $150,000 is the median income of a typical household in the top 10 percent, roughly the ranking of a family with $1 million in net assets, Professor Wolff says.
Without another source of income, perhaps from traditional pensions from either or both spouses, he adds, a household like this won't come close to replacing 80 percent of its pre-retirement income -- often considered an acceptable target level.
And, he says, if Social Security is important for the relatively affluent, it's all the more so for those with less income and wealth, especially with the decline of traditional pensions. "Social Security needs to be strengthened, not cut," he says.
Professor Munnell says this might be accomplished simply by raising the maximum taxable income level for Social Security payroll taxes. Currently, that level is $113,700. "Social Security has done its job and it can easily be made solvent in the future," she said.
There are a few steps that people can take on their own, she said. "When you're younger, and have a lot of human capital, you can save more and put a lot of the savings into stocks," she said. And then you can gradually shift into bonds as you age, fully understanding that the bond income may be quite limited. "When you're in your 50s," she continued, "you can try to save as much as you can, and try not to get accustomed to a lifestyle that you won't be able to afford later on."
You can also try to pay off your mortgage, so you have the option of tapping home equity if you need to supplement your income later. And, she suggested, if you're lucky you'll find work that you like and can stick with for a long time -- until 70, at least.
That might not be the way you imagined your life. But the numbers suggest that even if you're a millionaire, you might have to start.
Illustration DRAWING (DRAWING BY RYAN SANCHEZ) (BU1); CHART: Retirement Risks of Bonds: Conventional wisdom says people should hold more bonds as they age. But ultralow interest rates have left many would-be retirees with a big problem: the chance that they will exhaust their bond portfolios before they die. The outlook is worse for people who retire earlier and withdraw more. Adding stocks to a portfolio increases the risk of big losses, but it also reduces the risk that you'll outlive your money.

Full text:   Hiring in the United States is inching up -- but not quickly enough to put much of a dent in the backlog of nearly 12 million unemployed workers left stranded by the recession and its aftermath.
American employers added 175,000 jobs in May, almost exactly the average monthly job growth over the last year, the Labor Department reported Friday, and wages remained basically flat. Economists were relieved that the numbers were not worse, given a string of other disappointing data in recent weeks, but noted that current job trends still left the economy far short of what it is capable of if Americans were more fully employed.
At the current pace of job and labor force growth, it would take nearly five years to get the economy back to the low unemployment rate it had when the recession officially began in December 2007.
"I feel hopeless, and that just makes it hard," said Sherry Lockhart, 53, of Enumclaw, Wash., who was laid off by the state's liquor control board a year ago, when voters privatized liquor sales. Now, her jobless benefits are about to be slashed as a result of federal spending cuts. "I just feel I've done my best over the years, and I feel like I haven't failed the system. The system has failed me, and millions more."
By contrast, Wall Street was pleased with the latest report because the steady but modest gains suggest that the Federal Reserve will not feel comfortable tightening monetary policy anytime soon, as some had feared would be the case if the job market suddenly started showing major improvement. The Dow Jones industrial average and the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index each closed up for the day by more than 1 percent.
"It's a decent report, but it's not by any means robust," said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economist at RDQ Economics, a research firm. "It's certainly not strong enough to get the Fed to make any significant changes at its meeting in June."
The unemployment rate rose to 7.6 percent from 7.5 percent in April. The cause behind the uptick in the unemployment rate, at least, was also mildly encouraging: more people joined the labor force, perhaps indicating that Americans who have been sitting on the sidelines believe that they finally have a chance to find a job. This labor force participation rate is still low by historical standards, however.
Consumers have also been relatively upbeat recently. A New York Times/CBS News poll conducted May 31 to June 4 found that 39 percent of respondents believe the condition of the economy is very or fairly good, the highest share saying this both since President Obama took office and since the recession began in December 2007.
Despite signs of optimism from consumers and investors, other indicators of the health of the economy and the job market have been mixed. Average weekly hours and average hourly earnings, for example, have shown little improvement in recent months, according to the Labor Department. Wages are up just 2 percent from a year earlier, which leaves most Americans treading water, barely outpacing the rate of inflation.
"The wage gains are very disconcerting, and particularly strange when you see these surveys of employers who say they have positions they can't fill," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. "That means they should be bidding up wages."
Wage growth may be held back by the composition of jobs being created, he said, as there are many jobs being added in low-paying sectors like retail. Restaurants and bars, for example, have added 337,000 jobs over the last year; that category now makes up about 7.6 percent of all payroll jobs, its largest share on record.
The other big industry to add jobs in May was professional and business services, particularly temporary help services. Temp services employment has been growing for six consecutive months, and as of May, about 2 percent of all American jobs were in the sector.
The federal government, on the other hand, lost 14,000 jobs in May, partly because of the across-the-board spending cuts, known as the sequestration, enacted by Congress in March.
"With the recovery gaining traction, now is not the time for Washington to impose self-inflicted wounds on the economy," Alan B. Krueger, President Obama's chief economic adviser, said in a statement. "The administration continues to urge Congress to replace the sequester with balanced deficit reduction, while working to put in place measures to create middle-class jobs, such as by rebuilding our roads and bridges and promoting American manufacturing."
Over the last three months, the federal government has lost 45,000 jobs, not including the furloughs that many federal employees are being placed on. The Pentagon, for example, has said that it plans to furlough 680,000 civilian workers starting in early July, with most workers losing about one paid day a week.
Though difficult to measure, the sequestration has probably been dragging on the private sector as well, both because government contractors are laying off workers and because laid off or furloughed public workers have had less money to spend at their local businesses.
"There's surely some sequester effects in there, but that's something that will be disentangled in years to come," Mr. Shepherdson said.
The recession in Europe and slowdown in Asia are also creating headwinds for American manufacturers, which have lost jobs for the last three months. The length of the average workweek for manufacturing workers rose slightly, to 40.8 hours in May from 40.7 hours in April.
"If you're a manufacturer and you're uncertain about demand for your products because things in Europe aren't getting better, you might be more inclined to try to make more with what you have than to add permanent workers," Mr. DeQuadros said.
In addition to causing layoffs, the sequestration could also be affecting those who already have lost their jobs through cuts to social safety net services like Meals on Wheels, housing subsidies and job training programs.
As of May, there were 11.8 million people unemployed, 4.4 million of whom had been out of work for at least six months.
Almost every state has cut its unemployment insurance benefits as a result of the sequestration, according to the National Employment Law Project, a labor-oriented research and advocacy organization. Some states, like Florida and Maine, are cutting the number of weeks for which jobless workers will continue receiving benefits, and others, like Illinois, are reducing the size of the weekly benefit checks. Some states, like Washington and Idaho, are also laying off employees who work in the labor agencies that help workers apply for benefits and find jobs.
North Carolina is ending its federally funded extended unemployment benefits on July 1 because reductions in its state benefits left it ineligible for the federal money.
"I'm having a hard time finding somebody who will give a 50-year-old with a few health problems a chance," said Dwayne Fields of Goldsboro, N.C.
He was let go from his warehouse manager job of 12 years last October for "poor job performance" after he told his boss about some health problems, including a diagnosis of cardiomyopathy, hypertension and sleep apnea. He said he had since received treatment that has put him back into good working shape, but no one responds to his job applications. His $212 weekly jobless benefit checks are about to end.
"I'm probably too old to flip burgers and deliver pizzas," he said. "But if worse comes to worst, I'll do it. I've got an old lady and an 11-year-old kid to support."

Full text:   Home construction is booming in the United States, but it remains severely depressed.
That seemingly contradictory statement was illustrated by construction spending statistics issued this week by the Census Bureau. In April, spending on the construction of new houses and apartment buildings reached an annual rate of $195 billion. As can be seen in the accompanying charts, spending on home building is up 40 percent over the last year.
That is the largest such increase since the early 1980s. In the housing boom that preceded the Great Recession, such spending never rose more than 25 percent over a 12-month period.
But that rate of spending is down more than 60 percent from the peak, reached in 2006, and is lower than spending as far back as 1997.
The figures are not adjusted for inflation. Were they so adjusted, the current level of spending would be even lower compared with the pace of building in past years.
The charts are based on three-month averages of annual rates, in an effort to smooth out fluctuations caused by weather.
Over all, total construction spending is running at an annual rate of about $861 billion, or 28 percent less than the 2006 peak.
Private construction for things other than home construction continued to expand well after home building activity turned lower in 2006, and did not fall as far during the Great Recession. But the recovery in such spending last year has faded, and the latest figures show spending in that area is falling.
But that spending is not falling as rapidly as public spending on construction, which is dominated by spending by state and local governments. The latest figures show such spending is shrinking at an annual rate of 4 percent. Not since 2009 has such spending risen on a year-over-year basis.
While home-building activity is rising rapidly, some areas of spending that were strong during the boom have still shown few signs of revival. Spending on what the government calls multiretail building, including shopping centers and department stores, remains 60 percent below the peak, and after rising last year is again declining.
The proportion of the work force employed in the financial industry has fallen to the lowest figure since 1981, and that is showing up in spending on construction of offices for financial firms. That spending is running at a rate of about $1.7 billion a year, a figure that is lower than at any time since the government began collecting the statistic in 1993.
Within public construction spending, some areas have held up better than others. Among state and local governments, spending on construction of primary and secondary education buildings is running 40 percent below peak levels, but spending on higher education buildings is down only 15 percent, although both areas are declining in the most recent reports. As a result, the higher education share of total education spending is about 37 percent. Before the recession, the share was usually under 30 percent.
Chart Home Builders Spend Much More, While Governments Cut: Spending On Housing Construction in the United States Is Rising Rapidly, but It Remains at Historically Low Levels. Other Private Construction Spending Continued to Rise After Housing Spending Began to Fall in 2006, but It Also Fell Sharply During the Credit Crisis. The 2012 Recovery in Such Spending has Now Faded Away. Public Construction Spending, Meanwhile, Did Not Peak Until 2009, but has Been Declining Since Then and Is Now at the Lowest Level Since 2007. One Relatively Small Area of Construction Activity That Fell Sharply in the Recession and has Continued to Decline, Is Construction of Offices for Financial Companies Like Banks and Brokerage Firms.

Abstract: Buoyed by a healthier housing sector and a soaring stock market, American households continue to regain ground lost during the financial crisis and the severe recession that followed. Even as consumer spending remains healthy and the housing market rebounds, the labor market has been much slower to recover and many Americans at middle and lower income levels remain worse off than before the downturn.

Full text:   Buoyed by a healthier housing sector and a soaring stock market, American households continue to regain ground lost during the financial crisis and the severe recession that followed.
Without adjusting for inflation, the net worth of American households is now higher than before the recession struck five and a half years ago, the Federal Reserve said on Thursday.
Household net worth jumped by just over $3 trillion, or 4.5 percent, to $70.3 trillion in the first quarter of 2013, surpassing the $68.1 trillion reached in 2007.
After adjustment for inflation, total net worth still stands below the peak reached in mid-2007, said Dean Maki, chief United States economist at Barclays.
The encouraging report from the Fed comes amid other signs that Americans are feeling slightly better about the economy.
In a New York Times/CBS News poll conducted May 31 to June 4, 39 percent of respondents said that the recent condition of the economy was very or fairly good, the highest share saying this not only since President Obama took office but also since the recession officially began in December 2007.
About a third of respondents said that the economy was getting better, similar to what the trend had been in the previous six months. (Another 24 percent said that it was getting worse and 42 percent said the economy was staying about the same.)
Nearly half of respondents -- 46 percent -- rated the job market in their areas as very good or fairly good, with a third saying that they thought their local job markets would improve over the next year.
The poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
Despite newfound optimism in some quarters, the economy continues to send mixed signals. Even as consumer spending remains healthy and the housing market rebounds, the labor market has been much slower to recover and many Americans at middle and lower income levels remain worse off than before the downturn.
The latest report on jobs will come Friday morning, when the Labor Department reports employment data for May. Month-to-month numbers have been bumpy this year, with the economy adding a robust 332,000 jobs in February, then slowing to a pace of 138,000 new positions in March and 165,000 in April.
Economists are looking for the report to estimate that the economy created roughly 165,000 jobs in May, with the unemployment rate holding steady at 7.5 percent. On Thursday, the government reported that initial claims for unemployment benefits fell by 11,000, to 346,000, just under the four-week moving average of 352,500.
Trading on financial markets was volatile as investors readied positions ahead of the Labor Department report.
After spending much of the day in negative territory, the stock market staged a late-day rally. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 80.03 points to 15,040.62 and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index inched up 13.66, to 1,622.56. The Nasdaq composite index increased by 22.58, to 3,424.05.
The bond market rose modestly, with the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds falling slightly to 2.08 percent.
In the currency markets, the dollar fell sharply against the yen and the euro on Thursday, and continued to fall Friday morning. Currency traders will be watching the jobs data on Friday for signs about the economy's underlying strength and the Fed's next move on monetary policy.
The lackluster gains in jobs and income for most Americans stand in contrast to the rally on Wall Street and increase in home prices so far this year.
In the first quarter of 2013, real estate holdings accounted for a $784 billion gain in household net worth, while the value of corporate shares and mutual funds increased by nearly $1.5 trillion, the Fed said.
The stock market gains primarily benefit a fairly narrow stratum of American society, Mr. Maki noted, with the top 20 percent of earners holding 80 percent of stocks.
"That group always accrues the bulk of the benefits from a rising stock market," he said.
The Federal Reserve report also showed that Americans remained cautious, continuing to reduce debt levels and strengthen their personal balance sheets. Household borrowing sank at an annual rate of 0.6 percent in the first quarter, with mortgage debt declining by $53.2 billion.
The implosion of the housing sector, and the stock market tumble in 2008 and early 2009 took a huge toll on the net worth of American families. Between 2007 and 2008, household net worth dropped by nearly $13 trillion, a decline of nearly 20 percent.
While unemployment remains high by historical standards at 7.5 percent, the economy has shown signs of life lately. Consumer spending has held up this year, despite fears that an increase in payroll taxes and cutbacks in government spending might cool the economy.
The stock market has surged in 2013 in anticipation of better economic growth and expectations that the Federal Reserve will not pull back on its efforts to stimulate the economy until evidence is much stronger that jobs are more plentiful and living standards are improving. But stocks have wavered in recent days on worries that the central bank will not keep pumping as much money into the financial system.

Full text:   QUM, Iran -- Qum, home to some of Iran's most influential clerics, is not just Iran's holiest city, but one of its most powerful, a Shiite Vatican in the desert that can make or break any Iranian political career. So it is not surprising that it has become a destination recently for almost all of the candidates in next week's presidential election, seeking to sip from the cocktail of money, politics and religion that the city represents.
While the eight presidential candidates, carefully vetted by the government, all hold roughly the same views on the major issues, they need to make sure they have support from Qum.
"The top clergymen from Qum are among the few in the country who can openly criticize all politicians if they feel like it," said Farshad Ghorbanpour, an Iranian journalist. "Seeking their allegiance not only prevents public reprimands, but also means the support of their followers."
Qum's centrality to the election process tends to attract the more politically minded, though few here speak openly against the government. Sitting on the soft beige carpets that line the halls of the shrine of Fatemeh Masoumeh, a sister of Reza, the Eighth Imam, Rahman Askari, 26, an information technology and theology student from the city of Zanjan, sees the vote as an opportunity to finally achieve the goals of the 1979 revolution.
The bloody war with Iraq, waged from 1980 to 1988, and an accumulation of Western sanctions have long held back Islam in Iran, Mr. Askari said. Now, it is time to become more Islamic, he said, and suggested a much harder line in Iran's foreign policy.
"Islamic development means never backing down," Mr. Askari said, admitting that he, like most of the influential clerics in the city, supports Saeed Jalili, the former chief nuclear negotiator who is the candidate of the traditionalists, a coalition of conservative clerics and Revolutionary Guards commanders. "He is a religious man," Mr. Askari said. "Islam prescribes that we must never give up in the face of pressures, no matter if they are sanctions, war or criticism of our nuclear program."
The candidates seek the blessings of high-ranking clerics the way American presidential contenders court wealthy donors. Mr. Jalili, the presumed front-runner, visited the city twice last week, nailing down the support of Ayatollah Mohammad Taghi Mesbah Yazdi, who, according to analysts, seems to be the second most influential cleric in Iran, after the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
Mr. Jalili argues that the answer to Iran's problems lies not in "Western concepts" like Keynesian economics or human rights; instead he propounds vague slogans like Islamic development and creating an Islamic lifestyle.
Ayatollah Mesbah Yazdi, a hard-liner who in two elections supported the departing president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, has often said elections should be used as a way for people to confirm the rule of the clergy. He praised Mr. Jalili for not engaging in popular themes like the economy, instead emphasizing "Islamic and revolutionary values."
Other prominent candidates, including the mayor of Tehran, Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf, and Ali Akbar Velayati, a foreign policy adviser to Ayatollah Khamenei, have also recently made high-profile visits here.
Political missteps come at a high price in Qum. In 2005, President Ahmadinejad told Ayatollah Abdollah Javadi-Amoli that he had been surrounded by a divine light while addressing the United Nations General Assembly. The remark, caught on video, was a first crack in the now destroyed relationship between the president and leading clergymen, who suspect him of challenging their power by promoting individual relations with God.
Nobody here speaks of Mr. Ahmadinejad; most of the clerics who are close to the traditionalists are backing Mr. Jalili.
That is not to say this is a place of monolithic thinking. The 15 or so leading clerics all have good ties with Ayatollah Khamenei and support his policies, and those who are critical have been silenced. One of those, Ayatollah Yousef Sanaei, who supported the opposition leaders Mir Hussein Moussavi and Mehdi Karroubi when they fell out with the state after Mr. Ahmadinejad's disputed 2009 victory, has been muzzled.
But behind the official opinions there are glimpses of the same dissatisfactions that can be found elsewhere in the country.
During a funeral on Tuesday for the former Friday Prayer leader of the city of Isfahan, Ayatollah Jalaledin Taheri, who in 2002 quit his position in protest against the muffling of reformists, dozens of people shouted slogans in favor of the opposition leaders, calling for the lifting of their house arrests, videos on social media Web sites show.
Several of the hundreds of lower-ranking ayatollahs in Qum were dismayed when Ayatollah Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, a pragmatic moderate who in 2009 offered veiled support for the opposition, was disqualified by the conservative Guardian Council, insiders say.
"I do not understand how such an extraordinary figure like Rafsanjani, a man that has guided our revolution, is not allowed to try to become president," said Ayatollah Mohammad Feiz, an 89-year old cleric. A member of the council that voted in Ayatollah Khamenei as Iran's supreme leader in 1989, Ayatollah Feiz gave a long lecture on the Islamic Revolution as he served melon juice in his small workroom filled with books on Islam.
He recalled when security officers of Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi kicked down his door in 1964, looking for his neighbor, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the "imam," as he is now called here, who was later exiled and returned as the leader of the 1979 revolution.
"When they found him, they put him in a Volkswagen Beetle and sent him off to Turkey," Ayatollah Feiz said. The revolution produced great men, but "many of those that were with the imam are no longer in politics," he concluded.
"Only one of the eight candidates is a cleric; that illustrates how much things have changed since then," he said. "There are many shortcomings. I am not surprised people have become discouraged."
In an industrial neighborhood just outside Qum, several people said they shared Ayatollah Feiz's dissatisfaction. Business was slow, said Mehdi, 40, a garage owner who did not want to mention his first name out of fear of retribution.
"We need to fix our economy," he said. "I love Islam, but how do we fix 100 percent inflation? I'll vote for anybody with a good plan, but until now I haven't seen any candidate with clear ideas for the future."

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDEDJefferson County, Ala., took a big step toward resolving its historic bankruptcy case on Tuesday, saying it had reached an agreement to refinance most of the debt at the heart of its financial breakdown.
The refinancing would save the county hundreds of millions of dollars and position it to emerge from bankruptcy in a matter of months, according to people briefed on the negotiations. But the terms must still be approved by a federal bankruptcy judge, and the county must clear several other hurdles before it can emerge from bankruptcy. Lawyers for the county are scheduled to present details of the agreement in federal bankruptcy court in Birmingham on Wednesday.
The deal, according to the people briefed on the negotiations, covers about $2.4 billion of Jefferson County's total $3.078 billion in sewer debt, which was issued to pay for significant repairs needed to bring the county into compliance with federal clean water laws.
The interest due on the sewer debt shot up during the financial turmoil of 2008, and the repayment schedules accelerated sharply, leaving the county unable to pay. The repairs went unfinished as well.
The county also had other debt outstanding when it declared bankruptcy, for a total of $4.2 billion, making it the biggest municipal bankruptcy in United States history.
Governmental bankruptcies are rare and usually involve small single-purpose authorities and districts, not large, complicated counties with a lot of debt. Experts in public finance have been watching Jefferson County closely to see what kind of legal precedent it will set. Some were concerned that the successful application of Chapter 9 bankruptcy rules to municipal debt could cast a pall over the municipal bond market.
Residents of the county, for their part, have worried that they would bear the brunt of the bankruptcy, through lower property values or higher taxes or rates paid for county services.
The refinancing agreement covers debt held by creditors that include JPMorgan Chase, which holds about $1.22 billion of the sewer debt, the biggest block; three bond insurers; and seven hedge funds, according to a term sheet circulated in a meeting of the county commission on Tuesday.
The terms call for these creditors to receive about $1.84 billion for the $2.4 billion of debt they now hold. The concessions were weighted most heavily toward JPMorgan, the term sheet said, "to increase the recovery of other sewer creditors."
The bank is giving up $842 million, or about 70 percent, of the face value of its debt, according to people briefed on the negotiations. Just before declaring bankruptcy in 2011, the county abruptly rejected a previous package of concessions that called for JPMorgan to give up about $750 million.
JPMorgan was widely expected to make big concessions as part of any bankruptcy settlement, because some former officials of the bank were found to have been involved in improprieties in connection with a county debt refinancing in 2002 and 2003. That refinancing involved a complex package of variable-rate bonds and derivatives called interest-rate swaps.
A lawsuit by the county against JPMorgan over the improprieties, still active in state court, would be resolved as part of the proposed agreement. In 2009, JPMorgan agreed to forgive all the termination fees the county owed on the swaps, or about $647 million, to settle a complaint from the Securities and Exchange Commission. The bank also paid the county $75 million under the same settlement.
Despite those concessions, residents of Jefferson County have still often complained that they were treated inequitably because several of their elected officials went to prison as a result of the refinancing, while no one from the bank was convicted of a crime. They have railed in particular against the possibility that their sewer rates would go up to allow the county to pay sewer debt that many now see as illegitimate.
On Wednesday, the federal bankruptcy judge, Thomas B. Bennett, is also scheduled to hear arguments in a lawsuit arguing that much of the debt was issued in violation of the state Constitution and should be voided, not restructured or repaid.
In addition, the Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee for small creditors, has asked Judge Bennett for a full independent review of the sewer system's finances, as well as what it has called "poor planning, gross incompetence, waste, graft, corruption or fraud in connection with the construction, repair or rehabilitation" of the sewer system since 1997.
The term sheet indicated that the sewer fees for county residents would indeed rise, by 7.41 percent a year for the first four years of the refinancing deal. After that, they could rise by as much as 3.49 percent a year, depending on variables like inflation and new federal clean-water regulations.
Still, members of the county commission said the new agreement was significantly better than what they could have won without the bankruptcy filing. The five-member commission approved the terms in a 4-to-1 vote.
If the refinancing goes forward, the county's public creditors on the sewer debt will be offered a choice: either 80 cents for every dollar of sewer debt they now hold, if they relinquish all other claims, or 65 cents on the dollar with the right to pursue their own claims, either against the county or its bond insurers.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.
Correction: June 6, 2013, Thursday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Wednesday about a sewer debt refinancing agreement that may soon allow Jefferson County, Ala., to emerge from bankruptcy protection misstated the potential increase in sewer fees for county residents under the deal. After four years of annual 7.41 percent increases, they could rise by as much as 3.49 percent a year, not by 3.94 percent.

Full text:   The United States on Tuesday blacklisted what it described as a global network of front companies controlled by Iran's top leaders, accusing them of hiding assets and generating billions of dollars' worth of revenue to help Tehran evade sanctions over its disputed nuclear program.
The action, by the Treasury Department, was one of the broadest in the American-led effort to isolate and pressure Iran economically and came as Congress is moving toward enacting even harsher penalties on Iran.
It was the fourth time in a week that the Obama administration had escalated the sanctions and the first time it accused Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, of directing an effort to bypass them.
"Even as economic conditions in Iran deteriorate, senior Iranian leaders profit from a shadowy network of off-the-books front companies," David S. Cohen, the Treasury under secretary who oversees the sanctions effort, said in a statement.
The Treasury identified 37 companies, including enterprises in Germany, South Africa, Croatia and the United Arab Emirates, that it said operated as a labyrinth of "ostensibly private businesses" directed by the Execution of Imam Khomeini's Order, run by Ayatollah Khamenei.
The statement said the companies exploited favorable loan rates from Iranian banks for the profitable sale and management of property, including real estate in Iran confiscated from Iranians living abroad.
The main purpose, the Treasury statement said, was to hide billions of dollars in corporate profits, "evade our sanctions and escape international isolation."
The action was announced on the same day that Mr. Cohen testified before a Senate committee on the effectiveness of the Obama administration's sanction regimen, which some outspoken critics of Iran have called insufficient. Although Iran has suffered economically, its leaders have described the sanctions as a futile attempt to bully them.
The nuclear dispute is centered on Iran's uranium enrichment activities, which it calls peaceful and legal, but that Western nations suspect is a cover for developing the ability to make atomic bombs.
Talks aimed at resolving the dispute have stalled in advance of the Iranian presidential elections on June 14.
Under United States sanctions policies, blacklisted Iranian companies or individuals are banned from doing business with any American companies or individuals, and their American assets are frozen. Any company or individual that helps Iran evade the sanctions can also face heavy American penalties.
Over the past week, the Obama administration has blacklisted Iranian petrochemical companies, Iran's automotive industry and more than 50 Iranian officials, and has threatened to penalize foreign banks that trade or hold Iran's national currency, the rial.
There was no response to the latest sanctions from Tehran, where Ayatollah Khamenei and other top leaders commemorated the 24th anniversary of the death of the leader of Iran's revolution, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. But in a speech carried by Iran's state-run news media, Ayatollah Khamenei warned that whoever wins the election next week should never compromise on the nuclear issue.
"Some have the wrong analysis that by giving concessions to enemies, their anger toward Iran will be reduced," he said. "This is a mistake."
Mr. Cohen contended in his Senate testimony that the sanctions were having a profound effect on Iran, where oil exports have been halved, inflation has soared and the rial has lost two-thirds of its value in two years.
At the same time, he said, "we know there is far more to do" to isolate Iran, an acknowledgment of its leadership's intransigence.
Cliff Kupchan, an Iran expert at the Eurasia Group, a political risk research and consulting firm, said: "I think there is real frustration within the administration about the Iranian position on the nuclear issue." Given the pace at which Iran's nuclear program is progressing, he said, "there may not be more bites of the diplomatic apple."

To the Editor:
The American College of Gastroenterology is disappointed that "The $2.7 Trillion Medical Bill" ("Paying Till It Hurts" series, front page, June 2) unfairly casts outsized blame for high medical care costs on colonoscopy and by extension on gastroenterologists.
The roots of the problem of high medical costs are many, varied and complicated. The fact that the article focuses attention on the one and only preventive cancer test that has been demonstrated to significantly reduce the incidence of colon cancer and death from the disease is disappointing. The evidence suggests that colonoscopy is a public health success story.
Indeed, an article in The Times last year, "Report Affirms Lifesaving Role of Colonoscopy," reported on a study published in The New England Journal of Medicine that showed a 53 percent decline in deaths for patients who underwent colonoscopy and had precancerous polyps removed.
The American College of Gastroenterology is proud to have led the way on the issue of advancing colorectal cancer screening by colonoscopy. This is the test we recommend for our friends and family, as well as our patients. It is correct that there are screening strategies other than colonoscopy and likewise there are varied patient preferences, so while colonoscopy is our preferred screening strategy, we agree that the best test is the one that actually gets taken.
RONALD J. VENDER President American College of Gastroenterology New Haven, June 2, 2013
To the Editor:
I suspect that if physicians were salaried there would be a substantial decrease in the number of medical procedures performed, including colonoscopies. Money has an insidious way of biasing medical judgment. When physicians profit from every procedure, it is too easy for some to justify it as in the patient's best interest even when sound clinical judgment argues the contrary.
Second: There is a yawning and unjustifiable gap between payment for procedures and consultations. When I spend an hour to an hour-and-a-half with a patient who brings a stack of medical records and many imaging studies, I must often answer to Medicare for charging its highest consultation fee, which is but a fraction of the amount allowed for endoscopy.
Third: Overcoming an American culture that believes that more medical testing is better is a daunting challenge.
There is so much that is wrong with the byzantine and arbitrary way our doctors and hospitals are paid, and so many powerful entrenched interests arguing for the status quo, that it's easy to be pessimistic about meaningful reform.

The writer is a professor of clinical medicine at Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons.
To the Editor:
Your series on the high cost of medical care in the United States will perform a valuable service if it causes us to behave as consumers of medical services rather than as children of authoritative parents, as we currently do. There is a telling quote from a patient in your article: "If a doctor says you need it, you don't ask."
Attitudes like that need to change. Of course you ask. You ask why. You ask if there are other options. You ask how the results will affect your treatment. And you should be able to ask what it will cost.
The advertising slogan "An educated consumer is our best customer" applies to medical services as much as any other product or service. We have a responsibility to participate in our care.
CLAIRE BURSON New Milford, Conn., June 2, 2013
To the Editor:
"The $2.7 Trillion Medical Bill" suggests that the causes for high procedure costs are profiteering and no transparency. While this is true, the article doesn't address another major reason for price inflation: cost shifting from the uninsured and inadequately covered.
Many nonprofit hospitals are in the red as the "market" (insurance company contracting) demands discounted rates, and the uninsured are given services as mandated by law. Health care now exists in the worst of two worlds -- for-profit exploitation and, unlike any other "market," an obligation to give care at no cost to the uninsured.
The only solution: Medicare for all, a national health insurance that eliminates needless profiteering and stealth subsidies.
SARA HARTLEY Oakland, Calif., June 2, 2013
The writer is a psychiatrist.
To the Editor:
At age 50, I had a routine colonoscopy, recommended by my physician and fully covered by my insurance. When a copy of the bill arrived in the mail, I knew the temptation of simply looking for a zero balance and filing it away.
I actually examined the bill and found a whopping charge for an office visit. So I called the gastroenterologist's office and informed it that I never had an office visit. The billing clerk calmly explained that my insurance policy covers one office visit before the procedure. I learned that my "office visit" consisted of a perfunctory conversation I had with the doctor while I was wearing a paper gown, lying on an operating table and in a fog, minutes before he did the deed.
I tried to challenge this absurd billing to both the doctor and my insurance company, and got nowhere. If it's paid for, why should I care? I do care.
THOMAS P. ROBERTS Lawrenceville, N.J., June 2, 2013
To the Editor:
Your article rightly questions why an anesthesiologist is required for a colonoscopy. I would go further: No sedative of any kind is needed, in many if not most cases. In my experience, the procedure does not involve any pain, and scarcely any discomfort.
I have had several colonoscopies, all without a sedative. I insist in advance that it be that way. I can drive myself home afterward and go about my normal business for the rest of the day.
DONALD D. BREED Providence, R.I., June 2, 2013
To the Editor:
"The $2.7 Trillion Medical Bill" creates an underlying distrust between patients and physicians that will do little to fix the admittedly broken American health care system and potentially adversely affect the quality of patient care.
Portraying doctors as overly concerned with financial advancement plants seeds of skepticism in patients when a successful physician-patient relationship rests upon unwavering trust. The American College of Gastroenterology recommends colonoscopies not because of their profitability but because of their efficacy in colon cancer prevention.
Your article may serve as a deterrent for patients to follow their physician's advice.

U.S. Adds To Its List Of Sanctions Against Iran

Abstract: The latest actions, contained in an executive order effective July 1, were a response to what a White House statement called Iran's "continued failure to meet its international obligations," a reference to its disputed nuclear energy program, which Iran has called peaceful and Western nations call a guise to achieve the ability to make atomic bombs.

Full text:   The Obama administration escalated sanctions pressure against Iran on Monday for the third time in a week, taking actions that could further weaken the country's already-devalued currency and seriously disrupt its automotive industry, a significant domestic employer and revenue generator for the Iranian government.
The latest actions, contained in an executive order effective July 1, were a response to what a White House statement called Iran's "continued failure to meet its international obligations," a reference to its disputed nuclear energy program, which Iran has called peaceful and Western nations call a guise to achieve the ability to make atomic bombs.
Talks aimed at resolving that protracted dispute have stalled in advance of Iran's presidential elections in less than two weeks, and the leading candidate, Saeed Jalili, is Iran's top nuclear negotiator. He has said that the country will never compromise on the nuclear issue and that the sanctions will have no effect.
Under the executive order, President Obama authorized sanctions on any foreign financial institutions that conduct "significant transactions" in the Iranian rial, the national currency, or maintains rial accounts outside Iran. While the United States and European Union have taken other steps that severely limit Iran's ability to conduct financial transactions, the administration's action is the first time that the rial itself has been directly targeted for sanctions.
"As of July 1, significant transactions in the rial will expose anyone to sanctions," said an administration official briefing reporters in a telephone conference call. "It should cause banks and exchanges to dump their rial holdings."
The rial already has lost half its value from a year ago in part because of the cumulative effects of other economic sanctions, which have made it far costlier for Iran to import goods. Inflation has accelerated in Iran, and many people are worried that the rial could weaken further. The objective of the new sanction, the administration official said, is to "make the rial essentially unusable outside of Iran."
The executive order also authorized sanctions against any companies or individuals who do business with Iran's automotive industry, essentially adding that industry to Iran's shipping, shipbuilding and energy sectors, which have already been targeted under a sanctions law that took effect last year.
The sanctions generally freeze American assets of targeted Iranian businesses or individuals and prohibit them from commerce with any American companies or citizens. Foreign companies that help Iran evade the sanctions can also face severe reprisals, including a ban on doing business in the United States.
Mark Dubowitz, executive director of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington group that supports tough sanctions, said the automotive sanctions could have serious consequences for Iran, where the automotive industry is one of the biggest employers. Sanctions advocates in the United States also contend Iran's automotive industry is a major procurement network that imports material and technologies used to build uranium centrifuges instead of cars.
Last week, the United States blacklisted companies in Iran's petrochemical industry for the first time and issued sanctions against more than 50 Iranian officials for what the administration called their efforts to stifle political dissent in Iran.
Critics of the sanctions policy say it has done nothing to weaken the Iranian government's resolve and may be having the opposite effect. Trita Parsi, the founder of the National Iranian American Council, a Washington-based group that opposes the sanctions, pointed to Iran's intransigence on the nuclear issue, its more aggressive stance in military aid to the Syrian government and a State Department report last week that asserted Iran's support for terrorism is at its highest in 20 years.
Despite the sanctions, Mr. Parsi said, "Iran has moved in the wrong direction on every front."

Full text:   BEIJING -- For four days, more than 400 of China's brightest political minds gathered in smoke-clouded halls at a Beijing hotel, vigorously debating the nation's future.
It was April 1989, and after a decade of economic transformation, China faced a clamor for political liberalization. Days later, protests erupted in Tiananmen Square, and the lives of those at the meeting took radically different turns. Several are now national leaders, including Li Keqiang, China's prime minister. Others ended up in prison or exile, accused of supporting the demonstrations that shook the Communist Party and ended with soldiers sweeping through the city on June 4, shooting dead hundreds of unarmed protesters and bystanders.
"The atmosphere at the meeting was to let a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," said Chen Yizi, who helped organize the conference. "Afterwards, it was impossible to hold a meeting like that where everyone was willing to debate different points of view."
This year is the 24th anniversary of the bloodshed, and the first under a party leadership dominated by officials with such intimate and ambivalent ties to the events of 1989. Many top leaders served their political apprenticeship in the 1980s, when the boundaries between the permissible and the forbidden were not as stark and heavily policed as they are now. Their careers and friendships, and sometimes their viewpoints, overlapped with intellectuals, officials and policy advisers who were jailed or dismissed after the June 4 crackdown.
Few expect China's new leaders, installed in November, to overturn the official verdict that the protests were a counterrevolutionary rebellion that had to be crushed. But the immersion of today's leaders in the political experimentation of the 1980s raises the question of whether they will be more open to new ideas and discussion than their immediate predecessors in high office.
Chinese leaders openly debate competing approaches to the economy, but their calls for political liberalization have become increasingly rare. For now, at least, any potential embrace of the more freewheeling spirit of the 1980s appears to be hindered by the conformism demanded of those who have ascended in the hierarchy -- and their dread of being accused of ideological heresy.
Yet the lessons of June 4 and its repressive aftermath may weigh on the new leaders, especially if they are confronted by another political uprising, said Wu Wei, a former aide to Zhao Ziyang, the reform-minded party leader ousted shortly before the crackdown.
"For those in power now, it's still a heavy political burden, even if it's one that they can never openly discuss," Mr. Wu said. "Now the people who took part in that time are middle-aged or older, and it's still a knot in their hearts."
Prime Minister Li, now 57, was one of six current members of the elite 25-member Politburo who attended the meeting, according to Zhong Dajun, an editor for the official Xinhua news agency at the time. Others included Li Yuanchao, the vice president; Wang Qishan, the chief of anti-corruption investigations; and Yu Zhengsheng, who deals with policy toward religious groups, ethnic minorities and nonparty groups.
Many of these future Chinese leaders were among the hundreds of thousands of students who crowded into universities beginning in the late 1970s, eager for knowledge after years of rote-learning Mao Zedong Thought during the Cultural Revolution, when colleges were mostly shut or paralyzed by ideological campaigns. Photographs showed them dressed in the blue or green cotton coats of the Mao era, a reminder of the drab conformity they yearned to escape.
Throughout the Tiananmen upheaval, Xi Jinping, the nation's current president, was a local official in Fujian Province in China's southeast, far from the protests in Beijing. But his father, Xi Zhongxun, a veteran Communist turned supporter of economic reform, had been a friend of Hu Yaobang, the Communist Party leader demoted in 1987 for his liberal tendencies and whose death in 1989 sent thousands swarming into Tiananmen Square to voice their grief and demand steps toward democracy.
There are some indications that the elder Mr. Xi obliquely signaled opposition to martial law but stepped into line after June 4, said Warren Sun, a historian at Monash University in Australia.
At the time, China had abandoned the ideological zealotry of Mao's era and pursued market reforms under Deng Xiaoping that allowed farmers, factories and traders to escape state fetters. The economic changes were accompanied by a ferment of new ideas and calls for political opening and cultural renovation, despite counteroffensives against "spiritual pollution" led by conservatives.
"What we all shared was the belief that China had to reform, and to do so urgently," said Chen Ziming, a writer. "The only real division among students and scholars was whether to reform the economy first, or take on political reform first, or do both at the same time."
Many of China's current leaders started climbing the political ladder in this febrile atmosphere, when it was not unusual for officials to mix with advocates of more radical change, and even to show some sympathy for them. As a student, Li Keqiang socialized with Hu Ping and Wang Juntao, two firebrands who threw themselves into the unbridled student elections of 1980. Friends say Mr. Li sometimes joined in campus salons, where students stayed up late into the night debating electoral politics, Western philosophy and the excesses of authoritarian rule.
Later, friends say, Mr. Li was cajoled by party officials into giving up the chance to study abroad and instead became a cadre in the Communist Youth League.
"At the time, we had a lot of views in common," said Mr. Wang, who was jailed after June 4 and left for the United States in 1994. "A lot of the issues that came to divide us hadn't arisen yet."
Other future leaders came from similar backgrounds. Wang Qishan, the current anticorruption chief, won prominence in the early 1980s as one of the "four reform gentlemen," young intellectuals who advocated shifting away from a rigidly planned economy. Later that decade, he sat on the editorial committee of Toward the Future, a series of books avidly read by students.
Chen Yizi, the former leader of the government institute that organized the Beijing conference, recalled having long chats with Mr. Wang and one long conversation with Mr. Li in 1988. Referring to China's recently retired leadership, Mr. Chen said, "This generation should be more enlightened than Hu Jintao, Wen Jiabao and their generation."
By 1989, divisions were tearing at the Communist leadership. Despite a decade of economic growth, students and intellectuals were dismayed by corruption and the party's reluctance to emulate the changes sweeping the Soviet bloc. The broader public was also irate about official privilege and price reforms that had unleashed inflation.
Those tensions flared after the death of Hu Yaobang, when the mourning in Tiananmen Square escalated into demands to curtail the power and privilege of the party's elite through steps to democracy and free speech.
Mr. Zhao and other relatively moderate members of the party hierarchy advocated measured political liberalization and press freedoms to defuse discontent. But hard-liners argued that liberalization was a menace, not a cure. They had the backing of Mr. Deng, who was more enthusiastic about economic reforms than about political compromise.
Wang Juntao, the democracy advocate, recalled meeting Li Keqiang, his former university acquaintance, for a last time in mid-May 1989, when Mr. Li was among a group of officials trying to coax students to end a hunger strike and return to class. "As a student, he used to speak his mind," Mr. Wang said. "Now some of that pushiness was gone. He'd become an official who deferred to his superiors, but I still think he had a sense of justice."
By the time the government declared martial law in Beijing on May 20, Mr. Zhao's authority was broken, and Mr. Deng and party conservatives prepared a harsher response to students clogging Tiananmen Square. Two weeks later, soldiers and tanks plowed toward the square, and China went through a convulsion of purges and imprisonments.
To navigate these reversals, former acquaintances said Mr. Li and other Communist Youth League officials showed a ruthless pragmatism to ward off suspicions of disloyalty, taking steps that included attending meetings at which they denounced the protests as counterrevolutionary. "To survive in the party, you have to become an opportunist," Mr. Wang said.
Soon after the June 4 crackdown, Xi Jinping's wife, Peng Liyuan, a singer in a military troupe, was among the performers who entertained troops in Tiananmen Square. Photographs of her performance, published in a People's Liberation Army magazine in 1989, spread briefly on the Chinese Internet this year before disappearing -- a reminder of the sensitivities of that time.
"The party system changes people," said Mr. Wu, the former official. "Once you go down that path, you learn that to defend yourself, you have to defend the system. But I don't believe that era left no traces on them."

Full text:   HONG KONG -- THE combination of a strong, rising China and economic stagnation in Europe and America is making the West increasingly uncomfortable. While China is not taking over the world militarily, it seems to be steadily taking it over commercially. In just the past week, Chinese companies and investors have sought to buy two iconic Western companies, Smithfield Foods, the American pork producer, and Club Med, the French resort company.
Europeans and Americans tend to fret over Beijing's assertiveness in the South China Sea, its territorial disputes with Japan, and cyberattacks on Western firms, but all of this is much less important than a phenomenon that is less visible but more disturbing: the aggressive worldwide push of Chinese state capitalism.
By buying companies, exploiting natural resources, building infrastructure and giving loans all over the world, China is pursuing a soft but unstoppable form of economic domination. Beijing's essentially unlimited financial resources allow the country to be a game-changing force in both the developed and developing world, one that threatens to obliterate the competitive edge of Western firms, kill jobs in Europe and America and blunt criticism of human rights abuses in China.
Ultimately, thanks to the deposits of over a billion Chinese savers, China Inc. has been able to acquire strategic assets worldwide. This is possible because those deposits are financially repressed -- savers receive negative returns because of interest rates below the inflation rate and strict capital controls that prevent savers from investing their money in more profitable investments abroad. Consequently, the Chinese government now controls oil and gas pipelines from Turkmenistan to China and from South Sudan to the Red Sea.
Another pipeline, from the Indian Ocean to the Chinese city of Kunming, running through Myanmar, is scheduled to be completed soon, and yet another, from Siberia to northern China, has already been built. China has also invested heavily in building infrastructure, undertaking huge hydroelectric projects like the Merowe Dam on the Nile in Sudan -- the biggest Chinese engineering project in Africa -- and Ecuador's $2.3 billion Coca Codo Sinclair Dam. And China is currently involved in the building of more than 200 other dams across the planet, according to International Rivers, a nonprofit environmental organization.
China has become the world's leading exporter; it also surpassed the United States as the world's biggest trading nation in 2012. In the span of just a few years, China has become the leading trading partner of countries like Australia, Brazil and Chile as it seeks resources like iron ore, soybeans and copper. Lower tariffs and China's booming economy explain this exponential growth. By buying mainly natural resources and food, China is ensuring that two of the country's economic engines -- urbanization and the export sector -- are securely supplied with the needed resources.
In Europe and North America, China's arrival on the scene has been more recent but the figures clearly show a growing trend: annual investment from China to the European Union grew from less than $1 billion annually before 2008 to more than $10 billion in the past two years. And in the United States, investment surged from less than $1 billion in 2008 to a record high of $6.7 billion in 2012, according to the Rhodium Group, an economic research firm. Last year, Europe was the destination for 33 percent of China's foreign direct investment.
Government support, through hidden subsidies and cheap financing, gives Chinese state-owned firms a major advantage over competitors. Since 2008, the West's economic downturn has allowed them to gain broad access to Western markets to hunt for technology, know-how and deals that weren't previously available to them. Western assets that weren't on sale in the past now are, and Chinese investments have provided desperately needed liquidity.
This trend will only increase in the future, as China's foreign direct investment skyrockets in the coming years. It is projected to reach as much as $1 trillion to $2 trillion by 2020, according to the Rhodium Group. This means that Chinese state-owned companies that enjoy a monopolistic position at home can now pursue ambitious international expansions and compete with global corporate giants. The unfairness of this situation is clearest in the steel and solar- panel industries, where China has gone from a net importer to the world's largest producer and exporter in only a few years. It has been able to flood the market with products well below market price -- and consequently destroy industries and employment in the West and elsewhere.
THIS is the real threat to the United States and other countries. However, most Western governments don't seem to be addressing China's state-driven expansionism as an immediate priority.
On the contrary, European governments dealing with their own economic crises see China as a country that can help, either by buying sovereign debt or going ahead with investments in their countries that will create jobs.
The Chinese state-owned company Cosco currently manages the main cargo terminal in the biggest Greek port, Piraeus, near Athens -- a 35-year concession deal. And China's sovereign wealth fund, C.I.C., took a 10 percent stake in London's Heathrow Airport in 2012, as well as a nearly 9 percent stake in the British utility company Thames Water. The state-owned firms Three Gorges Corporation and State Grid are the main foreign investors in Portugal's power-generation sector, and C.I.C. also bought a 7 percent stake in France's Eutelsat Communications.
In the Greek port the Chinese have been able to triple capacity, amid local unions' criticism of worsening labor conditions. It's too early to measure China's impact in the other investments, but the fact that Chinese companies are able to invest in sectors that are closed or restricted for European firms in China says a lot about how minimal Europe's leverage with China is.
Take Germany, which accounts for nearly half of the European Union's exports to China. It's highly unlikely that Berlin would make unfair competition the cornerstone of its China policy. Moreover, the lack of leverage and leadership in Brussels means that the union is unable to take firm action to force China into adopting measures that would level the playing field or guarantee reciprocity in its domestic market.
The only exception is the United States, which seems to be addressing the issue by pushing forward the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a regional trade association that is seen by critics in Beijing and elsewhere as an American-led policy to contain China. The club is thought to be restricted to countries that meet high American standards on issues like free competition, labor and environmental standards and intellectual property rights. As China doesn't meet those standards, it will have to reform or risk regional isolation. Moreover, the United States has made life difficult for the Chinese telecom giant Huawei by refusing to grant it contracts from leading American telecom companies. This is not just about national security concerns but also about sending Beijing a clear message that the United States government is willing to block one of China's most visible and successful companies.
While Western companies complain about barriers to public procurement and bidding and struggles to compete in restricted sectors in China, Chinese companies enjoy red carpet treatment in Europe, buying up strategic assets and major companies like Volvo and the German equipment manufacturer Putzmeister.
The perception is that China is now unavoidable and, consequently, the only option is to be accommodating -- offering everything from a generous investment environment to essentially dropping human rights from the agenda. "We don't have any stick. We can just offer carrots and hope for the best," a senior European official told us.
Greenland, a massive resource-rich territory largely controlled by Denmark, is a case in point. Last year, it passed legislation to allow foreign workers into the country who earned salaries below the local legal minimum wage (the minimum wage there is one of the highest in the world). Chinese representatives had made it clear that Chinese state-owned banks and companies would invest in the high-risk, costly exploitation of Greenland's vast mining resources only if the modification of local regulations would allow the arrival of thousands of low-wage Chinese workers.
The Arctic territory didn't have too many alternatives. No other country is in a position to become Greenland's strategic partner for its future development, given the business risks involved in the Arctic region and the scale of the investment needed in a territory bigger than Mexico but without a single highway. An American oil company couldn't have handled the task alone. The Chinese state capitalist system, by contrast, allows multiple state-owned companies to work together, making it possible for the China National Petroleum Corporation, for instance, to extract oil while China Railway builds basic infrastructure.
Greenland's leaders accepted China's terms because they likely believed these costly projects might never go ahead if the Chinese didn't get involved; only China has the money, the demand, the experience and the political will to proceed. Moreover, there are not enough skilled workers in Greenland for such projects, so the Greenlandic government made an exception to the law, allowing Chinese laborers to earn less than minimum wage figuring that local residents would benefit from new infrastructure and royalties.
China's deep pockets, as well as its extensive labor force and unlimited demand for natural resources, made all the difference, and accordingly Greenland was prepared to pass tailor-made legislation to meet Chinese needs. Even Denmark, which holds authority in Greenland in areas like migration and foreign policy, decided not to interfere.
IT is even happening in progressive bastions like Canada. President Obama's refusal thus far to approve the Keystone pipeline project has made Prime Minister Stephen Harper's conservative government turn to China to secure an export market for Canadian crude oil reserves. The Calgary-based oil industry has lobbied Mr. Harper to adopt a new diversification strategy that includes the construction of a controversial pipeline to western British Columbia, despite strong opposition from environmental groups, the First Nations aboriginal communities and the public. In the meantime, Canada also signed a Foreign Investment Promotion and Protection Agreement with China, which gives remarkably generous investment protection to the Chinese.
With China in the center of debates over FIPA and the west coast pipeline, Canada's government then approved the takeover of the Canadian energy giant Nexen by the Chinese state-owned oil firm Cnooc. The $15.1 billion transaction was China's largest foreign takeover.
Closer economic ties have had political side effects; the Harper administration now seems much more cautious in criticizing China's human rights record. Given that Canada was until very recently one of the fiercest voices on China's handling of dissidents, this is not only a remarkable 180-degree turn, but also a clear indication of how China's economic influence can push the political agenda to the sidelines, even in the West.
In Australia, Chinese accumulated investment inflows at the end of 2012 surpassed $50 billion. The trend is striking: Chinese direct investment in Australia in 2012 increased 21 percent from 2011 levels to reach $11.4 billion, making it an important player in Australia's mining industry. Australia's trade portfolio remains highly diversified, but the Chinese share is growing rapidly.
China has also become the biggest investor in Germany (in terms of the number of deals), surpassing the United States. Chinese companies are looking for companies that, like Putzmeister, have a technological edge and have become world leaders in niche markets. Those takeovers also allow them to absorb Western know-how on branding, marketing, distribution and customer relations. Others are more opportunistic. Faced with recession, struggling European firms like Volvo quickly welcomed Chinese partners who were ready to inject capital and take full control.
The loans that Beijing is giving worldwide are even more significant, in dollar terms, than direct foreign investment. These loans include $40 billion to Venezuela and more than $8 billion to Turkmenistan in recent years. China's policy banks (China Development Bank and Export-Import Bank of China) are the key institutions supporting China's "Go global" strategy, as they provide billions of dollars in loans to foreign countries to acquire Chinese goods; finance Chinese-built infrastructure; and start projects in the extractive and other industries.
This is clearest in countries where the West claims to link its aid to human rights and good business practices. Chinese loans have been crucial in countries like Angola that have faced threats of a cutoff in financing from Western creditors, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Ecuador, Venezuela, Turkmenistan, Sudan and Iran have all faced such difficulties, and China has stepped in without political or ethical strings attached. Chinese statistics reveal little about these loans, but a study by The Financial Times showed that, between 2009 and 2010, China was the world's largest lender, doling out $110 billion, more than the World Bank.
It is important to remember what is really behind China's global economic expansion: the state. China may be moving in the right direction on a number of issues, but when Chinese state-owned companies go abroad and seek to play by rules that emanate from an authoritarian regime, there is grave danger that Western countries will, out of economic need, end up playing by Beijing's rules.
As China becomes a global player and a fierce competitor in American and European markets, its political system and state capitalist ideology pose a threat. It is therefore essential that Western governments stick to what has been the core of Western prosperity: the rule of law, political freedom and fair competition.
They must not think shortsightedly. Giving up on our commitment to human rights, or being compliant in the face of rapacious state capitalism, will hurt Western countries in the long term. It is China that needs to adapt to the world, not the other way around.

Abstract: Both are welcome developments to equity investors. [...]it results in losses for bonds," he said, which may prompt investors to sell those bonds and move money into stocks. Recently, Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, hinted that the central bank might soon begin to taper its purchases of Treasury bonds as part of its efforts to stimulate the economy.

Full text:   LOW interest rates have helped to fuel the stock market rally, and a climb in rates is eventually expected to snuff it out. At least that's the theory.
Here's the reality: In May, rates actually rose quite sharply, as 10-year Treasury yields jumped to 2.16 percent from 1.63 percent. Yet the Dow Jones industrial average still soared more than 400 points, to end the month at 15,115.57.
The stock market's road did become choppy as rates rose. The Dow lost more than 200 points on Friday, for example, but the overall trend remained upward. It just goes to show that while there is a connection between interest rates and the stock market, it isn't a simple one. When rates rise, said Jeffrey N. Kleintop, chief market strategist at LPL Financial, "it is not the size of the move itself, but the absolute level of yields reached that matters to the stock market."
Even with the recent uptick, the 10-year yields are only about half of what they were five years ago, during the global recession. And a climb in rates from such a low level may be a tail wind -- not a headwind -- for stocks, Mr. Kleintop said.
For starters, he said, "it reflects an improving outlook for economic growth and less risk of deflation." Both are welcome developments to equity investors. Moreover, "it results in losses for bonds," he said, which may prompt investors to sell those bonds and move money into stocks.
Indeed, over the past month, the average bond fund that invests in long-term government debt has lost more than 6.5 percent of its value, according to Morningstar, the investment research firm. The typical blue-chip stock fund, meanwhile, has gained about 4 percent.
But this is not to say that rising interest rates wouldn't hurt the stock market at all.
For instance, if rates were to climb enough to threaten the rebound in housing, stocks might start to sing a different tune, market strategists say. But the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is still at a historically low 3.81 percent, even though that rate is up since the end of April.
Similarly, climbing rates would threaten stocks if they signaled rising inflation, so that the Federal Reserve might have to curtail its efforts to stimulate the economy. But the most recent reading of the Consumer Price Index showed that prices were up only around 1.1 percent over the past 12 months. That's down from the 1.6 percent pace of inflation at the start of the year.
So how much would rates have to climb before investors became seriously worried about stocks?
If history is any guide, the threshold is around 6 percent.
Doug Ramsey, chief investment officer at the Leuthold Group, has looked at stock valuations and bond yields going back to 1878. He has found that while there is a relationship between the two, big trouble for the stock market appears to kick in only when 10-year Treasuries are yielding 6 percent or higher.
Theories abound as to why 6 percent seems the magic number. James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, argues that 6 percent is important because it reflects the overall economy's nominal long-term growth rate. "I can see why you'd get a negative reaction if the cost of capital for the market was above the inherent, sustainable growth rate of the economy," he said.
Mr. Ramsey offers a slightly different explanation. He said that for rising bond yields to hurt the stock market, they would have to be viewed by investors as real competition to stocks. Perhaps at 6 percent, he said, bond yields are high enough that "they are truly thought of as potential replacements or substitutes for long-term stock returns."
TO be sure, some market watchers say what really matters isn't the current move in long-term market rates, but what happens with the short-term rate that the Fed controls.
Recently, Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, hinted that the central bank might soon begin to taper its purchases of Treasury bonds as part of its efforts to stimulate the economy. He did not offer any clues, however, as to when the federal funds rate, now 0.25 percent, might be lifted.
John Stoltzfus, chief market strategist at Oppenheimer & Company, noted that whenever the Fed does raise short-term rates, "it could create a jostle in the stock market." But Mr. Stoltzfus warned investors not to assume that Fed increases would immediately pull the plug on the bull market.
He notes that the last time the Fed started raising rates was in June 2004, when the funds rate was at 1 percent. The central bank proceeded to lift rates 17 times through the end of June 2006. During that stretch, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 11.3 percent, while the Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks gained 22.5 percent. In the 12 months that followed -- while the Fed held rates steady -- stocks continued to post double-digit gains.
"What really counts here for investors is, are rising rates crimping the affordability of credit?" Mr. Stoltzfus said. With two-year Treasury notes yielding just 0.29 percent, he said, "I'd argue that we're far from that point."

Full text:   The N.H.L.'s conference finals will begin on Saturday, and fans in Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles and Pittsburgh can still dream of a Stanley Cup championship. But this year is an unhappy anniversary for America's northerly neighbor. It is 20 years since the Montreal Canadiens defeated the Los Angeles Kings to win the 1993 Stanley Cup; no Canadian team has won the championship since.
Just how unlikely has Canada's Stanley Cup drought been? And is there anything in the league's economics that might help to explain it?
The answer isn't simple, so let me give you the executive summary before we parse the details.
First, bad luck is a major component. Even after accounting for the fact that Canadian teams have rarely been among the league's best in recent years, you would still have expected Canada to pick up at least a couple of Stanley Cups at some point.
Second, the N.H.L.'s economic structure changed at an unfavorable time for Canada. During the first half of the 20-year drought, the league allowed teams to spend freely, but Canadian teams were hampered by the weak Canadian dollar. Since 2005, the Canadian dollar has recovered substantially, and Canadian teams are now turning large profits. But they are limited in their capacity to invest those profits in superior players because the league has instituted a hard salary cap.
Third, there is almost certainly a shortage of N.H.L. teams in Canada relative to the demand for hockey there and the revenues that Canada contributes to the league. Teams in nontraditional hockey markets like Raleigh, N.C., Tampa, Fla., and Anaheim, Calif., have won Stanley Cups since 1993, but without doing especially well financially. So have the Colorado Avalanche, who relocated from Quebec City in 1995-96. Had the distribution of N.H.L. teams more closely matched fan interest in the sport across the United States and Canada, Canada would have more teams in the league and -- very probably -- at least one Stanley Cup championship.
Finally, and related to the excess demand for hockey in Canada, Canadian teams routinely sell out their arenas at high ticket prices -- whether or not they are any good. This may reduce their incentive to compete.
The simplest way to conceive of the situation is to assume that each N.H.L. team begins with an equal chance of winning the championship and to estimate the odds of a Canadian team winning the Stanley Cup as a function of the number of Canadian teams in the league.
Eight of the 26 N.H.L. teams, or 31 percent, were from Canada in the 1993-94 season. The percentage fell to 20 (6 of 30 teams) by 2000-1, before increasing to 23 percent after the Atlanta Thrashers moved to Winnipeg in 2011.
If a champion were randomly chosen from all N.H.L. teams active each season, the odds that a Canadian team would have won at least one Stanley Cup since 1993-94 are 99.2 percent. (This period comprises 19 seasons, excluding 2004-5 when the N.H.L. canceled its season because of a labor dispute.) That means the chance of Canada failing to have won a Stanley Cup is just 0.8 percent, yielding odds of about 125-to-1 against.
But it is naïve, of course, to assume that the Stanley Cup champion is chosen randomly. Major League Baseball's Kansas City Royals, for example, aren't merely unlucky to have failed to reach the playoffs in 28 years: they have usually stunk. Perhaps the Canadian N.H.L. teams just haven't been very good either.
At first glance, the difference in competitiveness seems minor. Canadian teams have averaged 35.3 wins and 81.5 points per regular season over this period, compared with 36.7 wins and 84.4 points for the American teams. Canadian teams made the playoffs 54 percent of the time, compared with 56 percent for the United States-based clubs.
However, the Stanley Cup is not normally won by an average team that just sneaks into the playoffs -- instead, it usually goes to one of the best teams in the league. Eleven of the 18 Stanley Cup champions since 1993-94 have been seeded No. 1 or No. 2 in their conference. And there has been a lack of elite Canadian teams; only 14 percent of the No. 1 and No. 2 seeds since 1993-94 have been from Canada.
A more exacting way to evaluate the odds is by estimating each team's chance of winning the Stanley Cup as a function of its playoff seed and its regular-season power rating. (Power ratings, in this case, are taken from hockey-reference.com's Simple Ratings System, which accounts for each team's goal differential and strength of schedule during the regular season.) We can accomplish this by means of a logistic regression analysis. The probabilities for each season are recalibrated such that the 16 teams that make the playoffs have exactly a 100 percent chance of winning the Stanley Cup, in total.
In the 1996-97 season, for instance, I estimate that the Canadian teams had just a 2.1 percent chance of winning the Stanley Cup on the basis of their regular-season performance. Three of the six Canadian teams made the playoffs that year -- but all as No. 7 or No. 8 seeds, and none of them were much good.
In 15 of the past 19 N.H.L. seasons, in fact, the probability of a Canadian team winning the Stanley Cup, as calculated by this method, was lower than you would get if you drew from among all N.H.L. teams at random. Only twice -- the Ottawa Senators in 2005-6, and the Vancouver Canucks in 2010-11 -- did a Canadian team enter the playoffs as the best bet to win the Stanley Cup on the basis of regular-season performance.
You would still have expected a Canadian team to win the Stanley Cup sooner or later. The chance that at least one would do so was 97.5 percent, according to this method. Nonetheless, the lack of dominant Canadian teams has helped to make the 0-for-19 drought merely unlikely rather than almost impossible -- raising the chance of the Canadian shutout to 2.5 percent from 0.8 percent. So it is worth asking why Canadian teams have rarely been among the N.H.L.'s elite.
Perhaps Canadian teams are competing on an unlevel playing field? Among the seven current Canadian N.H.L. teams, the median television market is 1.7 million people. By contrast, the median American team competes in a television market with 5.4 million people.
Professional hockey, however, has an extremely regional following: it is extraordinarily popular in almost all of Canada, reasonably popular in parts of the northeastern and midwestern United States, and quite obscure elsewhere in the United States. These differences more than make up for the smaller size of Canadian markets. In fact, the typical Canadian team has considerably more N.H.L. fans in its market than the typical United States team does.
In 2011, I estimated the number of fans for each N.C.A.A. football team by comparing Google search traffic for the term "college football" in different media markets. We can do the same thing for hockey by evaluating the number of people who searched for the term "N.H.L."
On a per-capita basis, searches for the term "N.H.L." were more than seven times as common in Canada as in the United States. Although the United States population is about nine times larger than Canada's, this makes up for a lot of the difference.
How many N.H.L. fans are there in each country? A 2010 YouGov poll estimated that 11 percent of American adults were serious N.H.L. fans; a 2007 Scarborough Research study, using a stricter definition that was limited to the most avid fans, put the total at just 4 percent. Using the midpoint of those two surveys yields an estimate that 7.5 percent of Americans are N.H.L. fanatics, or about 23.5 million Americans among a population of 314 million.
The frequency of Google searches in Canada for "N.H.L." implies that about 54 percent of Canadians are serious N.H.L. fans, or about 18.5 million people in a country of 34.5 million.
In other words, the two countries are reasonably close in their number of N.H.L. fans, despite the United States' vastly larger population. I estimate that Canada accounts for something like 45 percent of the N.H.L. interest between the two countries. (The N.H.L., incidentally, makes about 40 percent of its national television licensing fees from Canadian networks -- and the percentage is likely to increase after the league negotiates new Canadian TV contracts.)
If N.H.L. teams were distributed between the countries in proportion to fan interest, Canada would have something like 12 to 14 teams out of a 30-team N.H.L. Instead, Canada has seven teams. This undersupply means that the Canadian N.H.L. teams have larger numbers of fans, on average.
In the chart below, I have used the Google search data to estimate the proportion of people in various United States and Canadian media markets who are serious N.H.L. fans. (The method uses Google search data at the metro-area level for the United States and at the provincial level for Canada as metro-level data is unavailable for Canada.)
The results demonstrate how much difference hockey avidity can make. Compare the cities of Los Angeles, Boston and Calgary. There are about 17 million people in the Los Angeles media market, 6.2 million in Boston's and 1.6 million in Calgary's. Based on their Google search traffic, however, I estimate that only 6 percent of the population in Los Angeles are serious N.H.L. fans, compared with 17 percent in Boston (high by United States standards) and 67 percent in Calgary (high even by Canadian standards). As a result, the three markets are roughly equivalent on hockey terms: each has about 1.1 million serious N.H.L. fans.
Another astonishing result can be obtained by comparing Houston and Saskatoon, Saskatchewan -- two markets that are occasionally mentioned as possible sites for N.H.L. expansion teams. Houston's media market has about six million people, compared with not quite 340,000 for Saskatoon. However, I estimate that only 2 percent of Houston residents are serious N.H.L. fans, versus 46 percent of the population in Saskatoon. Thus, they are roughly equal at about 150,000 N.H.L. fans each.
Accounting for the far greater propensity of Canadians to follow hockey, the median Canadian team plays in a market with about 1.1 million N.H.L. fans, while the median United States team plays in a market with about 530,000 fans.
The American cities that have had their hockey teams for a long time generally place well above the United States median, however. Of the United States-based markets that had an N.H.L. team continually since 1990, all but St. Louis have at least 500,000 fans.
So a couple of decades ago, there was a nice balance in the N.H.L. between American cities with large populations but moderate hockey interest, and Canadian cities with moderate populations but intense hockey interest. There were a few outlying cases -- Los Angeles has very low hockey interest but a very large population, while Buffalo has a modest population but levels of hockey affinity that approach Canadian levels. These teams functioned well enough, and no team was dragging down the average that much. The American markets that the N.H.L. has ventured into since 1990 have only about 250,000 hockey fans on average, however.
These differences in hockey interest have a profound effect on each team's bottom line. In the chart below, I have compared the number of hockey fans in each market against their estimated operating profit or loss in 2011-12, according to Forbes magazine. (For the markets with multiple hockey teams, I have divided the fans as follows: in New York, 55 percent of the market to the Rangers, 25 percent to the New Jersey Devils and 20 percent to the Islanders; and in Los Angeles, two-thirds to the Kings and one-third to the Anaheim Ducks. These estimates are derived by evaluating the number of Google searches for the team names among the residents in each metropolitan area.)
This measure of hockey fans does a very good job of predicting each team's profitability. The 13 teams with 700,000 or more N.H.L. fans in their markets all made money and totaled $357 million in operating profits. The six teams in markets with fewer than 300,000 fans all lost money, totaling $77 million in operating losses. The teams between 300,000 and 700,000 fans had varied results but roughly broke even, on average. (This is the range in which a quality of a team's management matters, along with other factors like per-capita income in the region and a team's appeal outside its immediate metropolitan area.)
Six of the seven Canadian teams are above the 700,000-fan threshold (and therefore made money). So did Winnipeg, with roughly 560,000 fans. In total, Canadian teams brought in $219 million in operating profits in 2011-12 -- whereas the American teams made a net of just $31 million. (Outside of the highly profitable Rangers, in fact, the United States-based teams lost money that year.)
So why have the Canadian teams struggled to win Stanley Cups?
Part of it stems from the same reason that operating profits are so closely tied to the number of N.H.L. fans in each team's media market. N.H.L. teams vary greatly in how many fans they have available to them. But under the league's current collective bargaining agreement, there is relatively little revenue sharing. There is a hard salary cap, however, along with a high salary floor, so each team's player expenditures are about the same.
The good news for the Canadian teams is that, with nothing else to spend them on, those extra revenues flow through straight through to the bottom line. The bad news is that they could not spend them by investing in better player talent, even if they wanted to.
Before the lost season of 2004-5, the N.H.L.'s economics were different: there was no salary cap. But something else was different as well: the Canadian dollar had been historically weak against the American dollar. Thus, the Canadian teams could not take full advantage of the excess demand for hockey in the country.
In the next chart, I have estimated per-game ticket revenues for American and Canadian N.H.L. teams since 1995. Ticket revenues are calculated as per-game attendance during the regular season, multiplied by average ticket prices as reported by Team Marketing Report. (Since 2003, Team Marketing Report has designated a portion of tickets in each arena as premium seats; I assume that 20 percent of ticket sales are priced at premium levels.) All figures are denominated in current (inflation-adjusted) United States dollars. The chart also shows how much revenue the Canadian teams would have brought in had the American and Canadian dollars been trading roughly at parity throughout the period, as they have been recently.
Per-game ticket revenues for the Canadian teams lagged somewhat behind the United States teams from 1995 through 1999. This was mostly because of the weak Canadian dollar; the Canadian teams would have run even with or slightly ahead of the American teams otherwise. From 2000 through 2003, the American and Canadian teams made about the same amount of money from a typical game despite a still fairly weak Canadian dollar. Since then, the Canadian dollar has strengthened, and Canadian teams have moved considerably ahead of the American teams: the average Canadian team now makes about 50 percent more than the average American team on a per-game basis. However, it is during this period that the N.H.L.'s salary cap has been in place.
But even if the Canadian teams cannot spend their extra revenues on better player talent, this does not fully explain why they have been underachieving in the Stanley Cup and not at least winning their fair share of championships.
Much of the reason, I must emphasize again, boils down to bad luck. Canadian teams have reached the Stanley Cup finals five times in the 19 seasons since 1992-93 but have come up short on each occasion, including in four cases where the series went to the seven-game maximum.
One other factor, however, may be that there is so much excess demand for hockey in Canada that the Canadian franchises do not have to field especially strong teams to sell out their stadiums or to make a considerable profit. In the next chart, I have compared the per-game ticket revenues for each team in the 2012-13 season against the number of points they tallied between this season and the last one.
For the United States teams, there is an imperfect but reasonably clear and statistically significant relationship between on-ice success and ticket revenues. There are lots of fair-weather American hockey fans, and they may not turn out unless their team is pretty good. In Canada, there is less competition from other sports, and there are many die-hard hockey fans who attend games almost no matter what. Consider, for instance, that the Toronto Maple Leafs increased their average ticket prices from about $75 (in inflation-adjusted United States dollars) in 2005-6 to $140 this season (or from about $85 to $140 in inflation-adjusted Canadian dollars) -- despite never qualifying for the playoffs in the interim. They have almost always sold out their stadium anyway.
These results can be generalized across other seasons. I ran a regression analysis that estimates per-game ticket revenues as a function of the number of hockey fans in a given media market, the number of points that a team averaged between the current season and the previous one, and a time trend. (Point totals are adjusted relative to the league-average number of points to correct for seasons shortened by labor disputes and changes to N.H.L. rules; the number of fans is expressed as a natural logarithm.)
For American teams, an additional regular-season win (worth 2 points in the standings) yields about $10,600 in extra ticket revenues per game, or roughly $430,000 over a full regular season. For Canadian teams, the marginal value of an additional regular-season win is about $1,400 per game (or $60,000 per season), which is not statistically or practically significant.
So the Canadian N.H.L. teams may suffer from a version of the problem that the Chicago Cubs faced during the "bleacher bum" years. Their fans are so loyal -- happy enough to turn out for the spectacle and the beer even if the team stinks -- that the franchises don't have all that much incentive to put out a competitive product.
Whether this has actually translated into complacency or mismanagement is harder to demonstrate. Even if N.H.L. teams are constrained in how much they can spend directly on player salaries, they could make other expenditures that should eventually translate into on-ice success -- for example, by investing more in scouting and development. The Toronto Maple Leafs, the Montreal Canadiens and the Vancouver Canucks each employ 20 or more scouts, according to their Web sites -- well above the N.H.L. average of about 15. So there is some evidence that they are making a good-faith effort to produce a quality team. (I wouldn't want to slander any professional sports franchise by comparing it with the Chicago Cubs.)
Nevertheless, a strong case can be made that these teams could stand some additional competition from N.H.L. franchises in their media markets and elsewhere in Canada.
I estimate, for instance, that there are five million N.H.L. fans in the greater Toronto region (which I define fairly liberally to include the outskirts of the Golden Horseshoe): about twice as many as in the New York metropolitan area, which has three N.H.L. teams. And Montreal and Vancouver are not far from New York in their number of N.H.L. fans.
Even acknowledging that additional N.H.L. teams in Toronto would not expect to draw as well as the Maple Leafs -- just as the Islanders and the Devils do not have nearly as many fans as the Rangers -- adding a second team in the Toronto area seems all but certain to produce another profitable N.H.L. franchise in a league where many teams are unable to break even. The new team would need to capture only about 14 percent of the Toronto market to reach the 700,000-fan threshold that seems to guarantee profitability in the N.H.L. A good case could also be made for a third Toronto-area team, along with second teams in Montreal and Vancouver.
At the other end of the fan-interest scale, it seems very difficult for N.H.L. teams with fewer than about 300,000 hockey fans in their media markets to turn a long-run profit under the league's current economic system. One might hold out hope that the newer hockey markets in the United States will grow to provide more revenue for their teams, but the evidence has not supported this conjecture so far. Per-game ticket revenues for United States teams in nontraditional media markets have grown at a rate of just 1.4 percent per year (inflation-adjusted) over the past 18 seasons, compared with 2.6 percent annually for traditional United States hockey markets and 4.2 percent annually for Canadian teams. These struggling United States teams hurt the Canadian teams both directly by diluting the share of Canadian teams in the league, and indirectly by compelling a salary cap structure that is meant to protect the struggling American teams (but which has yet to make most of them profitable).
My best guess is that the economically optimal distribution of N.H.L. franchises would look something like the schema in the chart below. This would include two new teams in the greater Toronto area, one new team in Montreal and one new team in Quebec City. In lieu of a second team in Vancouver, Seattle -- a marginal hockey market but probably better than several United States cities that already have N.H.L. teams -- would get a franchise in the hope that support might spill over into British Columbia and other parts of the Pacific Northwest. New York would retain its three N.H.L. teams as the Islanders sought to find success in Brooklyn, while Los Angeles (which has no more N.H.L. fans than Philadelphia or Boston and fewer than Vancouver or Montreal) would be shaved to one. The six United States markets with fewer than 300,000 N.H.L. fans would lose their teams.
This would yield a league with 11 Canadian franchises out of 28 -- just shy of 40 percent -- a level that comes much closer to the share of N.H.L. interest and revenues between among the two countries. And it would all but ensure that Canada's Stanley Cup drought ends sooner rather than later.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text:   There is a joke in the airline business that you could make money giving out free beer and charging a fee for the bathroom.
No one has tried that -- at least not yet -- but one small airline has led the way in the United States when it comes to passenger fees: Spirit Airlines, the no-frills carrier that prides itself for offering the lowest fares, then charging passengers for everything else.
Need an agent to print out a boarding pass at the airport? That's $10. Want some water? That's $3. Rolling a bag on board? The tag costs $35 from home and $50 at the airport. In all, there are about 70 fees enumerated in dizzying detail on Spirit's Web site for customers to navigate.
To the millions of travelers flying on vacation this summer, the fees can be infuriating, but Spirit makes no apologies. In an age of consolidation in the airline industry, Spirit, with about 1 percent of the nation's passenger traffic, has managed to succeed by going it alone, scraping for every dollar and scrimping on every cost.
"Spirit does everything it can to make or save a buck," said Henry Harteveldt, a travel analyst with Hudson Crossing. "To its credit, Spirit doesn't promise passengers that they'll be coddled. Its customer service standards are terrible, and the airline's actions have shown it doesn't care about being liked or respected."
The driving force behind that strategy is Spirit's chief executive, Ben Baldanza, 51, an industry veteran who arrived at Spirit eight years ago with no experience at a no-frills airline. Along with an obsessive attention to keeping costs low, Mr. Baldanza argues that the cornucopia of fees allows the airline to keep its fares lower than rivals. The airline, known for its tasteless ads (during the presidential election, one ad talked of Spirit having "binders full of sales. Women will love them!") is modeled after Ryanair, which charges low fares for flights throughout Europe with a minimalist approach to customer service.
"I cringe a little when people say I don't care about customers," said Mr. Baldanza, who brims with missionary zeal. "We care about the thing that customers tell us they care the most about, and that's offering the lowest possible fares. The customers who fly Spirit absolutely understand the trade-off."
On a recent day at La Guardia Airport, passengers seemed to be taking the fees in stride. Two students forgot about the fee that Spirit charges for carry-on bags. That did little to reduce their enthusiasm to fly to Las Vegas despite the early loss. Kevin Reed, a photographer flying to Myrtle Beach, S.C., paid an extra $10 on top of a $35 checked-bag fee because he failed to do so when he bought his ticket.
"They got me there," he said, shrugging. "But I'm still saving $400 over flying with Delta."
Not every customer has the same reaction, though. Spirit is routinely rated as the nation's worst airline because some travelers deem the fees unfair. The Transportation Department receives far more complaints about Spirit than other carriers, with 6 to 8 complaints per 100,000 passengers compared with the industry average of 1.4. And Spirit's on-time record is similarly abysmal, at 68.8 percent compared with 80 percent for the industry average. The best airlines are in the mid-90s.
Critics point out that the inflation of air travel fees makes it increasingly difficult to compare the cost of travel between airlines.
"The fee-for-everything technique allows airfares to be advertised as much lower than the overall cost," said Paul Hudson, the president of FlyersRights.org, a consumer group.
Mr. Baldanza acknowledged that the process can be tricky. "You can't sleepwalk through the process," he said.
But the model has allowed Spirit to offer cheap tickets. Since 2008, Spirit's airfare has dropped by 20 percent, averaging $75 in 2012 compared with $94 in 2008. The difference often jumps out at a customer searching for flights. On Friday, Spirit was offering a nonstop flight from Oakland, Calif., to Portland, Ore., in mid-July for $156; the same trip was $296 on Delta.
Because of its growing list of fees, however, nonticket revenues grew to $51.39 in 2012, from $18.61 in 2008. As a result, while fares fell, Spirit's total revenue per passenger grew by 12 percent from 2008 to 2012, reaching $126.50. Fees now account for 41 percent of Spirit's revenues, an industry record.
The trade-offs are obvious. Spirit has no business class, offers no movies and no Wi-Fi, and its seats don't recline, legroom is the tightest in the business. But a nonstop flight from Dallas to Orlando costs $366 on Spirit and $499 on American Airlines.
Still, Spirit is not about to take over the domestic industry. The carrier, which caters to leisure travelers and not the business flier, has only 49 planes, compared with more than 600 for Southwest. But it is growing about 20 percent a year when most of the industry is contracting or staying flat. It plans to add four more planes this year and another 17 over the next two years.
The airline, based in Miramar, Fla., flies about 50 routes, mostly on the East Coast, Florida, Central America and the Caribbean. It started flying as a charter airline in 1980, but adopted a low-cost model in 2007, when new investors charted a different course for the unprofitable airline.
Last year, Spirit had its fourth consecutive year of profitability, and generated some of the best returns in the industry, along with a record return on invested capital of 26.5 percent.
Investors have responded. Since the company's initial public offering two years ago, shares have more than doubled. They traded at $30.43 on Friday, valuing Spirit at $2.21 billion.
Mr. Baldanza said he is not done and wants to grow the fleet to 150 planes within five years and account for about 3 percent or 4 percent of traffic. He likens his airline to Southwest in the mid-1980s, when the low-cost airline was the industry's maverick.
Like Southwest before it, Spirit achieves significant savings from its bare-bones operations. This explains why the airline charges for water on board, since carrying bottles has a cost that Mr. Baldanza refuses to pay. "If you can do it yourself, it's free," he said. "If we have to do it, you'll pay for it."
Another way Spirit cuts costs is by packing more passengers on its plane, which all have 178 seats, while similar models on US Airways and JetBlue have 150. This allows Spirit to spread its costs. Its planes also fly longer each day -- nearly 13 hours, allowing for more flights. Southwest, by contrast, flies its planes about 10.4 hours a day.
At La Guardia, Spirit operates 12 flights every day out of a single gate. Passengers are not given many scheduling options either.
"We schedule our flights when the gate is available as opposed to when the customers want to fly," Mr. Baldanza said. "It doesn't matter that no one wants to fly at 9 a.m. or 2 p.m. or in the middle of the night. The reality is that they want to fly when they get the low fare."
Spirit also makes sure its flights are always full and sets its prices accordingly. (There's a joke inside the airline that empty seats don't check bags, Mr. Baldanza said.) As a result, it costs Spirit just 10.15 cents to fly one passenger for one mile, compared with United's 18.25 cents and Southwest's 11.08 cents.
Spirit was the first airline to charge for checked bags, in 2007, a move others eventually followed.
Last year, airlines collected $6 billion just from checked bag fees and reservation changes, up from $1.4 billion in 2007, according to the Department of Transportation.
Spirit was also the first airline to charge passengers for their carry-on bags, but that's still a red line few have dared to cross except for Allegiant Airlines and Frontier.
The big question is whether travelers will eventually push back on fees.
"People don't like the extra fees, they don't read the fine print and they get mad," said Ann Sheaffer, an accountant checking in for a Spirit flight to Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport. "But it's all there in black and white. You just have to read it and understand it."

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Americans cut back on spending in April after their income failed to grow, a sign that economic growth may be slowing.
Consumer spending dropped a seasonally adjusted 0.2 percent in April, the Commerce Department said on Friday. That was the first decline since May 2012. It followed a 0.1 percent increase in March and a 0.8 percent jump in February.
A drop in gasoline prices most likely lowered overall spending. Adjusted for inflation, spending ticked up 0.1 percent in April. Still, that was the smallest gain since October.
Consumers also seemed to spend less to heat their homes in April, which may have reduced spending on utilities. April's weather was mild after an unusually cold March.
Income was unchanged in April, after a 0.3 percent rise in March and 1.2 percent gain in February. Wages and salaries barely grew, while government benefit payments fell.
In the euro zone, unemployment continued its relentless march higher in April, according to official data published Friday, hitting yet another record.
The jobless rate for the 17 countries that use the common currency rose to 12.2 percent, from 12.1 percent a month earlier, with 19.4 million people out of work, according to Eurostat, the European Union statistics agency. Some analysts said the number of people without jobs could hit 20 million by the end of the year.
Separate data from Eurostat showed that inflation in the euro zone rose to 1.4 percent from 1.2 percent.
Most analysts do not expect the European Central Bank to cut interest rates or take other action to stimulate growth when its policy-making council meets in the coming week, but the inflation rate could prompt the central bank to wait for clearer signs that there is no risk of higher prices.
In the United States, the retrenchment in spending indicates consumers may be starting to feel the effect of higher taxes.
But a separate report Friday showed that consumer confidence rose to a six-year high in May, suggesting the decline in spending may be temporary.
Americans are taking home less pay this year because of a two-percentage-point increase in Social Security taxes. A person earning $50,000 a year has about $1,000 less to spend this year. Income taxes on the wealthiest Americans also increased.
Consumer spending drives 70 percent of economic activity. It grew at the fastest pace in more than two years from January through March, helping the economy expand at a 2.4 annual rate during that quarter.
Economists said the latest spending figures suggested that growth might be slowing in the April-June quarter, to around a 2 percent rate. But most still expect growth to improve slightly after that as the effect of tax increases and government spending cuts fades.
Paul Ashworth, chief North American economist at Capital Economics, called it "a sobering report" for people expecting stronger growth. "There will be some modest pickup in the second half of the year, as the fiscal drag starts to ease, but we expect the improvement to be very gradual rather than dramatic."

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDEDThe Obama administration on Friday escalated efforts to isolate Iran economically, blacklisting Iranian companies in the petrochemical industry for the first time and punishing five businesses in four other countries for conspiring to evade American sanctions aimed at restricting Iranian oil sales and air transportation.
The new steps came a day after the administration issued sanctions against a top aide of Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and more than 50 other Iranian officials for what it called their efforts to repress dissent and free speech in Iran, where presidential elections are scheduled in two weeks.
Under the increasingly strict sanctions on Iran, the United States freezes any American assets of blacklisted companies and individuals and bans them from doing business with any American companies or citizens. In addition, companies and individuals in other countries who help Iran evade sanctions can be cut off from the American financial system and face other restrictions.
"We are committed to intensifying the pressure against Iran, not only by adopting new sanctions, but also by actively enforcing our sanctions and preventing sanctions evasion," David S. Cohen, the Treasury Department under secretary whose office oversees the sanctions effort, said in a statement. "Today's actions take aim at revenues from Iran's petrochemical sector, as well as deceptive schemes Iran has employed in an effort to evade sanctions on its oil sales and its airlines."
The United States has never before aimed direct sanctions at Iran's petrochemicals industry, which Treasury officials said had become an important source of revenue to the Iranian government as sales of oil -- its most important export -- have fallen sharply in the past few years because of the effects of other sanctions, including a European Union embargo.
"The administration is taking action today to target this revenue stream by both designating companies involved in transactions with the sector and identifying several petrochemical companies as subject to sanctions because they are controlled by the Iranian government," the Treasury statement said.
The blacklist announced Friday covers eight companies scattered throughout Iran, five of them in special economic zones designed in part to encourage foreign investment.
American and European Union sanctions on Iran are aimed largely at pressing the country to halt its uranium enrichment activities, which the Iranians say are peaceful but which Western governments suspect are a cover for achieving the ability to make nuclear weapons.
Negotiations over the uranium enrichment have stalled with little expectation of progress anytime soon, particularly with Iran's approaching elections. A leading presidential candidate, Saeed Jalili, the country's unyielding nuclear negotiator and a protégé of Ayatollah Khamenei, has vowed that Iran will never bend to Western economic pressure on the nuclear issue.
The non-Iranian companies targeted by the American sanctions include Ferland Company, which is based in Cyprus and Ukraine and is accused of helping Iran disguise an oil shipment to evade sanctions; and Kyrgyz Trans Avia of Kyrgyzstan, Ukrainian-Mediterranean Airlines and Bukovyna Airlines of Ukraine, and Sirjanco Trading L.L.C. of the United Arab Emirates, all accused of helping Iran procure aircraft used to move illicit cargo to the Syrian government in its war against a two-year-old insurgency. Iran is Syria's major regional ally in that conflict.
Despite rising inflation and a weakening currency caused in part by the sanctions, the Iranian government has said it is weathering the economic deprivations. On Friday, the deputy economic minister, Behrouz Alishiri, was quoted by the semiofficial Fars News Agency as saying said Iran enjoyed "remarkable growth" in foreign investment this past year.
Correction: June 4, 2013, Tuesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Saturday about the Obama administration's escalation of efforts to isolate Iran economically overstated the significance of the action it announced on Friday toward the country's petrochemical industry. It was the first time it had imposed direct sanctions on petrochemical companies -- not the first time the administration had targeted the industry.

Full text:   SÃO PAULO, Brazil -- Brazil's largest cement producer, Votorantim Cimentos, is planning to raise as much as $4.8 billion in what would be one of the largest initial public offerings worldwide this year.
The move is a positive sign for Brazil as the country's government and private sector have been trying to encourage more financing through the public markets.
The company filed a preliminary prospectus on Friday, saying it would offer up to 540 million units, priced at 16 to 19 reais a share. If all the units were sold at the maximum price, the company would raise 10.26 billion reais, or $4.8 billion.
After a weak 2012, in which only three Brazilian companies held I.P.O.'s, the country's capital markets are recovering. Six public offerings have been held in Brazil in 2013. According to Thomson Reuters, the largest global I.P.O. was also in Brazil, when the insurance giant BB Seguridade raised $5.74 billion at the end of April. If successful, Votorantim Cimentos's public offering would rank as the second-largest globally so far this year.
Votorantim Cimentos's units will be offered on both the BM&F Bovespa stock exchange in São Paulo and on the New York Stock Exchange, with each unit representing one common share and two preferred shares. The pricing will be announced June 19 and trading should begin June 20.
Itaú BBA, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Securities, Credit Suisse, BTG Pactual, HSBC, Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank, Banco Bradesco BBI, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Banco do Brasil and Banco Votorantim are underwriting the offering.
According to the prospectus filed with the S.E.C., the company will use 45 percent of the money raised to finance its growth and potential acquisitions, in Brazil and abroad.
Votorantim Cimentos has operations in 20 countries, including the United States, but the vast majority of its business is in Brazil, whose booming real estate and construction sectors have benefited the company.
This success has come despite economic weakness in Brazil, where inflation is forecast at nearly 6 percent and the economy only grew at a 2.2 percent pace in the first quarter.
But after the drought of public offerings in 2012, investor appetite appears strong for Brazilian companies, especially ones that have dominant positions in relatively strong sectors of the economy.
Votorantim Cimentos will be the only Brazilian cement producer traded on the stock market, so its shares may prove attractive to investors eager to participate in the sector. The company is a subsidiary of Votorantim Industrial, one of Brazil's largest conglomerates, which had $11.5 billion in revenue last year.
Votorantim Industrial's other operations include steel and other metals, cellulose, agriculture, energy, and even finance, but Votorantim Cimentos is one of the crown jewels, responsible for $4.7 billion in revenue.
Like many Latin American companies, Votorantim Industrial is controlled by its founding family. Its chairman, Antônio Ermírio de Moraes, is worth an estimated $12.7 billion. (That makes him the 74th richest person in the world and the third richest in Brazil, according to Forbes magazine.)
Even after this I.P.O., Votorantim Industrial and Mr. Ermírio de Moraes should continue to own enough shares to maintain control of Votorantim Cimentos.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text:   The American markets are getting worried again. But this time the fear is refreshingly different.
The worry is that economic growth may be about to accelerate.
After five years of a disappointing economy, such a concern sounds too good to be true, and perhaps it is. But imagine what will happen if it is not. We've been complaining for years about how slow the recovery is. It would be great if it sped up appreciably.
But you might not know that if you listened to some of the commentary these days. Those who see a black cloud behind every silver lining can point to plenty of negatives in a good economy. Bond investors will lose money as the value of long-term bonds declines. That will mean that a lot of people are poorer. Banks own a lot of Treasuries, and some of them could suffer as the value of those bonds decline.
Perhaps rising interest rates will prompt a sell-off in the stock market. Perhaps they will choke off the recovery in housing.
The federal government will suffer a hit from having to pay higher interest rates as it borrows money. The Federal Reserve, which has bought a lot of long-term government bonds and mortgage securities, will lose money -- perhaps a lot of it -- as it sells those securities at lower prices than it paid. It might lose so much money that it stops funneling profits to the Treasury, further damaging the government's fiscal position.
Added to those specifics is the feeling that we are about to enter uncharted territory. Just as the Fed never before engaged in quantitative easing, it has never before unwound the positions. Who knows if it can handle the challenge?
"The Federal Reserve will need to carefully navigate through the completion of quantitative easing," the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said this week in its generally gloomy semiannual global economic forecast. "A premature exit could jeopardize the fragile recovery, but waiting too long could result in a disorderly exit from the program with sizable financial losses."
Of course, we've all known that -- someday -- the Fed would have to start reducing its positions. But on Wall Street, someday can seem a very long way off. "This was supposed to be next year's trade," a hedge fund manager told me this week.
What made it seem like this year's trade was the sudden backup in the bond market that began early in May and accelerated late in the month after the Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, mused that the Fed might be able to start to backing off the easing program later this year. The yield on 10-year Treasuries, below 1.7 percent early this month, rose above 2.1 percent on Tuesday.
That may not sound like a lot, but to owners of such bonds, it is a problem. If they bought at the latest auction of 10-year Treasuries, on May 8, the value of their securities fell enough in three weeks to offset more than a year of income.
That latest drop came on the heels of some surprisingly good economic news, as well an upbeat forecast. Last week, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said it expected the unemployment rate, now 7.5 percent, to fall to 6.5 percent by late next year. That is earlier than the Fed had expected when it said 6.5 percent was the level at which it might choose to back away from quantitative easing,
Then this week the Standard & Poor's Case-Shiller home price index was reported to have leapt 10.9 percent over the year through March. That was the largest gain since 2006, when the housing bubble was in full expansion. And on the same day that was reported, the Conference Board said consumer confidence was at a five-year high.
There are reasons to restrain enthusiasm about both figures, though. Home prices hit their lows for the cycle in March 2012, so this is a bounce off the bottom. And while consumer confidence is up, it is still well below the levels that seemed acceptable before the financial crisis. During the decade before the economy began to crater in 2008, there were only two months -- in 2003 -- when the index was as low as it is now. And not all statistics are surprising on the upside; first-quarter gross domestic product was revised a bit lower in the latest estimate, released Thursday.
The sudden optimism about the American economy -- even if it is tempered by fears about how we will handle prosperity -- came in part because the economy is not behaving as it did in 2011 and 2012. At the time, signs of strength as the years began were followed by spring swoons. So strength early this year was seen as a setup for another such fall. Add to that the increase in payroll taxes at the beginning of the year, and there was a widespread expectation that the economy would weaken.
But so far, anyway, it has not.
As for the Fed's ability to unwind quantitative easing, it may be worth remembering that the current level of interest rates -- short-term government interest rates near zero and long-term rates below 3 percent -- is not unprecedented.
"I have been struck by parallels between the challenges facing the Fed today and those when I first entered the system as a neophyte economist in 1949," Paul Volcker, the former Fed chairman, said this week when he accepted an award from the Economic Club of New York. Then as now, rates were low. But the Fed at the time controlled long-term rates as well as short-term ones, and there was a lot of fear about what would happen if markets were allowed to push long-term rates higher.
Government debt exceeded 100 percent of G.D.P. after World War II, he noted, "so there was concern about an intolerable impact on the budget" if rates rose. "Ending Federal Reserve support might lead to panicky reactions, and declines in bond prices would drain bank capital," he said. "Mainline economists, and the Fed itself, worried that a sudden rise in interest rates could put the economy back into recession."
We survived that increase in rates, and we will survive this one, whenever it comes.
What matters is why interest rates are rising. "In a world where bonds are getting killed because of inflation or mushrooming budget deficits, they will also kill stocks and home prices," said Robert Barbera, the co-director of the Center for Financial Economics at Johns Hopkins University. "If the proximate cause of a bond market sell-off now is that the trajectory of growth is a lot better, that is good news."
Of all the fears being bandied about now, as in 1949, worry about the effect on government finances is perhaps the most foolish one. A stronger economy can do wonders for tax receipts, as they are noticing in California. And while banks may lose money on bonds, they should make a lot more from fewer loan defaults in a weak economy. As for rising mortgage rates, the immediate effect might be an even stronger housing market, as some people try to buy before rates rise further.
The rise of the stock market since late last year has produced more than its share of doubters, who complained there was nothing in the economic data to justify the increase. Perhaps, Mr. Barbera said, "it will turn out that the inexplicable rise of the stock market turns out to indicate the market correctly anticipated" the improvement in the economy.
I've been fooled before by this economy -- notably in early 2011 -- and perhaps the latest "green shoots," to recall what Mr. Bernanke thought he saw in 2009, will again prove to be temporary. But for now it is nice to hear concerns about a surprisingly strong economy, rather than what we have heard for most of the last five years.

Full text:   As chairman of the Federal Reserve, Paul A. Volcker tamed inflation. More recently, he took on the country's biggest banks in an effort to force them to give up lucrative but risky Wall Street-style trading.
Mr. Volcker will declare another war on Wednesday, this time on the public's eroding faith in government. He plans to begin a foundation called the Volcker Alliance, aimed at improving how government works at the local, state and federal levels.
As he did in those other battles, Mr. Volcker faces a struggle. Wall Street has been pushing hard lately for a looser interpretation of what is widely known as the Volcker Rule, giving banks more flexibility when it comes to trading.
Mr. Volcker plans to deliver an address on Wednesday at the Economic Club of New York in which he will spotlight the challenges facing financial regulatory reform, including how slowly Washington has put the Dodd-Frank legislation, which was signed into law nearly three years ago, into effect.
"I've gotten concerned by the seeming impotence of federal regulatory agencies," Mr. Volcker said. "Too many agencies overlapping, too many opportunities for delay."
Mr. Volcker, whose goal is to start with a budget of about $5 million a year, plans to finance a substantial part of that personally, and will raise money from outside donors.
The group will work with universities as well as private entities like the RAND Corporation and the Partnership for Public Service, supporting research projects, awarding fellowships and holding conferences on how to make government work better.
Despite well-financed programs at Ivy League universities like Harvard and Princeton and elsewhere, in some academic quarters, "public administration is almost a bad word," Mr. Volcker said in an interview on Tuesday at his office in Rockefeller Center. Too often, he said, the focus is on theory rather than the nuts and bolts of governance.
"We're not going to be a think tank," he said. Initially, "We're going to be a catalyst, a coordinator, with a couple of senior people, a few junior people and some nonresident fellows."
"I want it to be free-standing," said Mr. Volcker, who said he worried his project would not have the same impact if it were begun under the auspices of an academic institution.
The Volcker Alliance will operate out of Mr. Volcker's offices in New York.
One focus will be putting into effect the Dodd-Frank legislation, which was passed in 2010 and was aimed at strengthening financial market regulation. The instituting of specific regulations, however, has been mired in federal bureaucracy. Agencies have been slow to write the regulations, including the provision known as the Volcker Rule, which seeks to prevent financial institutions with government backing from placing bets with their own capital.
The final language for the execution of the Volcker Rule may be completed this year, but some experts fear the rule-writing process could easily slip into 2014. The banking industry, which has deep pockets and possesses great influence in Washington, has been mounting a huge lobbying effort to dilute the Volcker Rule's effects.
Among other things, the Volcker Alliance will also explore ways to promote the training of bank supervisors who might one day be charged with enforcing the Volcker Rule. In addition, it is looking at a partnership with a university that would focus on putting financial change into effect.
Mr. Volcker acknowledged that it would not be easy to alter public perceptions of government, noting how sharply attitudes had changed since he entered public service during the Kennedy administration at the Treasury Department. As Washington has become more polarized, fewer and fewer public officials have careers resembling that of the 85-year-old Mr. Volcker, who served in a variety of administrations, Republican and Democratic.
After a stint at what was then Chase Manhattan Bank, he returned to the Treasury Department, this time in the Nixon administration. He was president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York from 1975 to 1979, and then was Fed chairman in the Carter and Reagan administrations.
In the early years of Mr. Volcker's two terms, the Fed raised interest rates sharply, which helped set off a recession but also ended the high inflation rates that plagued the United States in the 1970s and early 1980s.
A well-connected veteran of Washington and academia, Shelley H. Metzenbaum, will serve as the group's president, and Mr. Volcker has recruited other public figures for its board, like former Senator Bill Bradley and Alice Rivlin, a former Fed vice chairwoman who was director of the Office of Management and Budget in the Clinton administration.
Other board members will include Sheila Bair, the former chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, as well as William H. Donaldson, who co-founded the Wall Street firm of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette and went on to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission during the George W. Bush administration.
"So much energy goes into getting a law passed," Ms. Metzenbaum said. "There isn't the same impetus in terms of implementation."
"It's about accountability," she added. "How do we get government agencies to keep moving forward?"

Full text:   HONG KONG -- While developed economies have worried whether international investors will keep showing up at their bond auctions if their central banks keep printing money, China has had a different worry.
So many speculators want to move money into China that its biggest problem has been how to keep them out.
In the United States, the European Union and Japan, central banks have struggled with hangovers from past housing bubbles, anemic or no economic growth and even deflation, in the case of Japan. In China, a possible housing bubble is still going strong.
The central bank is keeping interest rates low partly to discourage speculators from pushing even more money into China. But low mortgage interest rates -- as little as 5.2 percent, in an economy with consumer price inflation running at 2 to 4 percent a year -- have set off further surges in home prices.
After a sharp slowdown last summer, economic growth rebounded vigorously last winter in China. But an unexpected weakening of growth in recent weeks has created a problem that the People's Bank of China, the central bank, is just starting to acknowledge.
Further monetary stimulus -- which might seem to be the answer for a slowing economy -- could drive housing prices even higher. Rising home prices are a source of tremendous anxiety across China, because very few young people can afford to buy an apartment when even an 800-square-foot unit can cost 35 times a young college graduate's first-year salary.
China's banking system has been awash with credit for years, with one result being that financing has been provided for even seemingly uneconomical projects like skyscrapers in third-tier cities or high-speed train lines to economically depressed areas. But the government's response to economic weakness in recent weeks has been to encourage the state-controlled banking system to engage in another round of heavy lending at low rates.
"It's very disappointing; this splurge in credit creation has taken off again," said George Magnus, a senior economic adviser to UBS. "What you need to put this genie back in the bottle is quite a stern application of oversight and supervision."
In its recent quarterly report on monetary policy, the People's Bank of China warned against being "blindly optimistic" that inflation was under control, given continued brisk growth in lending and the money supply. The central bank has allowed lending to race ahead while pursuing an unexpected approach to trying to limit inflation: letting the renminbi appreciate gradually against the dollar, which makes imports less expensive and helps them compete on price with domestic goods.
The renminbi has climbed 1.3 percent against the dollar, mostly since the start of April.
Chinese central bankers face another puzzle that their Western and Japanese counterparts have not had to worry about: mysterious mass deaths of pigs and their effect on inflation.
Video of thousands of dead pigs floating in a river near Shanghai in March temporarily made pork much less appetizing for tens of millions of Chinese. The occurrence of a new form of bird flu in the same area several weeks later turned many people away from chicken.
Because meat makes up one of the largest slices of household spending, the abrupt national experiment in something approaching vegetarianism -- beef and lamb are much less popular in China -- has sharply slowed consumer price inflation, to 2.4 percent in April.
That has made it hard for the central bank to argue that inflation is a problem. But no one knows -- not veterinarians, not the World Health Organization and certainly not the central bank -- how long livestock will continue to be infected, much less how much longer Chinese families will be put off chicken or pork.

Abstract: Mr. Jalili, known as Iran's unyielding nuclear negotiator and a protégé of the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is emerging as the presumed front-runner in Iran's presidential election on June 14, an unsettling prospect for future relations with the West.

Full text:   TEHRAN -- At his first presidential campaign rally, Saeed Jalili on Friday welcomed the cheers of thousands of young men as he hauled himself onto the stage. His movements were hampered by a prosthetic leg, a badge of honor from his days as a young Revolutionary Guards member in Iran's great trench war with Iraq.
"Welcome, living martyr, Jalili," the audience shouted in unison, most of them too young to have witnessed the bloody conflict themselves but deeply immersed in the national veneration of its veterans. Waving flags belonging to "the resistance" -- the military cooperation among Iran, Syria, the Lebanese Shiite group Hezbollah and some Palestinian groups -- the crowd roared the candidate's election slogan: "No compromise. No submission. Only Jalili."
Mr. Jalili, known as Iran's unyielding nuclear negotiator and a protégé of the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is emerging as the presumed front-runner in Iran's presidential election on June 14, an unsettling prospect for future relations with the West. Mr. Jalili, 47, who many analysts say has long been groomed for a top position in Iran, is by far the most outspoken hard-liner among the eight candidates approved to participate in the election.
Opposing "détente a hundred percent" and promising no compromise "whatsoever" with the West over matters like Iran's nuclear program and involvement in Syria, Mr. Jalili seems set to further escalate Iran's standoff with the United States and its allies if elected president.
"He seems to be Ahmadinejad Phase 2," said Rasool Nafisi, an Iran expert based in Virginia, referring to Iran's current president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. "He would probably not be a partner to negotiate for the nuclear issues, as we have seen before when he was heading the delegations."
An analyst based in Iran, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of reprisals, said Mr. Jalili was "the perfect follower of Khamenei."
"If he gets elected I foresee even more isolation and conflict, as he doesn't care about foreign relations, the economy or anything," the analyst said.
In recent weeks, Mr. Jalili has garnered the open support of Iran's governing establishment, a coalition of conservative clerics and Revolutionary Guards commanders known as the traditionalists. High-ranking Shiite Muslim clerics have begun speaking out in his favor, and a nationwide network of paramilitary volunteers, the basij, is now helping to organize his election campaign.
He has been featured in flattering terms in recent weeks in the semiofficial Fars news agency, which is connected to the Revolutionary Guards, as well as in dozens of Web sites and other news outlets. By contrast, the other candidates now sometimes discover their campaign appearances canceled for unclear reasons and often find themselves under sharp attack in interviews on state TV, while Mr. Jalili gets softball questions.
"He'll easily get 30 percent of the vote," said Amir Mohebbian, an analyst close to Iran's leaders, pointing to the well-organized groups supporting Mr. Jalili. "The remainder will be divided between the other candidates."
That would lead to a runoff election that Mr. Jalili would be heavily favored to win, since under Iranian law the president must receive at least half of the vote.
Iran's presidential elections, lacking independent opinion polls and subject to manipulation, are notoriously unpredictable. In 2005, Mr. Ahmadinejad came out of nowhere to win. In 2009, millions of people took to the streets to protest what they said was widespread fraud in the voting that returned Mr. Ahmadinejad to office over the more popular opposition candidate, Mir Hussein Moussavi.
But the major threats to Mr. Jalili's candidacy were apparently eliminated when the representatives of two influential political factions, one led by Mr. Ahmadinejad and the other by a former president, Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, were disqualified from the election by the conservative-dominated Guardian Council. That decision underscored not just the determination of the traditionalists to consolidate power, but their ability to ensure the result.
In a recent opinion article, Mr. Mohebbian said that while Mr. Jalili's relative inexperience in domestic politics might make him appear as an outsider, the support of Iran's governing establishment made it likely that "the conditions of the day will create an atmosphere which will put Mr. Jalili in a leadership position."
While Ayatollah Khamenei is officially neutral, Mr. Jalili's speeches and viewpoints closely resemble the leader's worldview of an Iran engaged in a multifaceted battle with the West.
"The best president," Mr. Khamenei said on Monday, speaking to students at a military academy, "is the one who powerfully resists the enemy and will turn the Islamic republic into an international example for the oppressed people of the world."
Mr. Jalili, who sports a gray beard and prefers collarless shirts, headed Ayatollah Khamenei's office for four years, starting in 2001, before emerging in recent years as the chief nuclear negotiator. But little is known about his views on other issues.
"Mr. Jalili is like a watermelon," said Mohammad Khoshchehreh, an economist and professor at Tehran University. "He looks ripe on the outside, but we don't know what color he is inside."
Partly because of Western sanctions, Iran's economy is reeling from high inflation and a battered currency, but Mr. Jalili has addressed the problems only obliquely. During a televised interview on Sunday he said that Iran should cut its dependency on oil revenues and establish a "resistance economy in order to foil the conspiracies against Iran."
Such talk has left economists baffled. "His theory of resistance economy doesn't mean anything," Mr. Khoshchehreh said. "If it is based on looking at our weak points, that can be good, but we have no idea if he has a deep knowledge. We are worried about him."
On Friday, during the campaign event in Tehran, Mr. Jalili chose to explain his policies by citing the first imam of the Shiites, the martyr Ali.
"All across the region we can hear our battle cry, 'Ya Ali,' " said Mr. Jalili, who wrote a dissertation on the Prophet Muhammad's foreign policy. "We heard it in Lebanon with the victory of Hezbollah. We hear it in our resistance against the Zionist regime. Time and time again we have proved our strength through this slogan."
As songs played memorializing the battles in the border town of Shalamcheh during the Iran-Iraq war, men punched their fists in the air and shouted, "The blood in our veins belongs to our leader."
The goal of Iran and its allies, Mr. Jalili said, is to "uproot capitalism, Zionism and Communism, and promote the discourse of pure Islam in the world."
He did not directly mention the Western sanctions that were imposed over the country's nuclear program -- which Iran insists is for peaceful purposes but the West says is a cover for developing nuclear weapons -- or the possibility that they will be tightened in response to Tehran's intransigence. Nor did he speak about the potential for deeper involvement in the Syrian civil war, where Tehran's proxy, Hezbollah, has recently intervened in support of the Syrian government.
If his supporters harbored worries over what these policies might mean for the Iranian economy, they kept them to themselves. "We are fighting an ideological war -- nobody cares about the economy," said Amir Qoroqchi, 25, a smiling electrical engineering student from the holy city of Qum. "The only thing that matters is resistance."
For decades, Iran's presidents have staked out an alternative power center, frequently in conflict with the supreme leader and the more conservative elements in the government. With the rise of Mr. Jalili and the apparent elimination of serious opposition candidates, those on the losing end of Iran's political spectrum fear a developing imbalance.
The republican and authoritarian religious parts of the government "have been in conflict from Day 1," Mr. Nafisi, the Iran expert, said.

Central Banks Act With a New Boldness to Revitalize Economies

Abstract: [...]the economic stagnation of the major developed nations has driven central banks in the United States, Japan, Britain and the European Union to take increasingly aggressive action. Because governments are not taking steps to revive economies, like increasing spending or cutting taxes, the traditional concern of central bankers that economic growth will cause too much inflation has been supplanted by the fear that growth is not fast enough to prevent deflation, or falling prices. Last month, the departing governor of the Bank of England, Mervyn King, gave a speech at the International Monetary Fund in which he said -- a bit acidly -- that there was a limit to what monetary policy could do to spur recovery in a country like Britain, where a small number of stingy banks dominate the economy and the government is tightening its spending.

Full text:   When James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, arrived in Frankfurt last week, he issued an unusual public warning to the European Central Bank: Be bolder.
Central bankers, anywhere in the world, are a cautious lot. They prefer slow and steady over the dramatic gesture. And they rarely go public with criticisms of other central banks.
But the economic stagnation of the major developed nations has driven central banks in the United States, Japan, Britain and the European Union to take increasingly aggressive action. Because governments are not taking steps to revive economies, like increasing spending or cutting taxes, the traditional concern of central bankers that economic growth will cause too much inflation has been supplanted by the fear that growth is not fast enough to prevent deflation, or falling prices.
The Fed has announced plans to keep borrowing costs at historic lows until unemployment declines. The staid Bank of England has bought more than a half-trillion dollars' worth of bonds to ignite British business activity.
Last month, Haruhiko Kuroda, the new chairman of the Bank of Japan, steered the central bank toward an audacious new policy of reinflating the Japanese economy by doubling the money supply. It is considered the boldest step so far by a central bank.
So far, the results of these activist central banks have fallen short of expectations.
"I'm not sure why we're not getting more response," said Donald L. Kohn, a former Federal Reserve vice chairman who is now at the Brookings Institution. "Maybe we've made some progress in identifying some of the causes, but it's not fully satisfying why we have negative real interest rates everywhere in the industrial world and so little growth."
Certainly investors around the world watch for any sign that the central bankers are backing away from their bold steps.
Stock markets wobbled in Japan and elsewhere last week on fears that the Federal Reserve might start pulling back on its stimulus sooner than expected and that Japan's effort might fall short of its goal of reviving the economy. A few central bankers' reassurances seemed to calm the markets.
The lackluster results have provided cover for the European Central Bank, which has remained the most cautious of the major central banks. It is sticking to the more traditional formula of cutting interest rates -- a string Japan ineffectually pushed for more than a decade -- in the hopes that it will encourage banks to lend more money to businesses.
The Federal Reserve in the United States has been significantly more aggressive since December 2008, when the Fed reduced its benchmark short-term interest rate nearly to zero. Ever since, it has pursued a pair of experiments aimed at dragging other interest rates closer to zero, too.
The Fed has tried to bolster confidence that rates will stay low by talking more about the future. In December, it said it intended to keep short-term rates near zero at least as long as the unemployment rate remained above 6.5 percent, the first time it had tied policy to a specific target. That, and buying almost $3 trillion in Treasury and mortgage-backed securities, has helped to cut borrowing costs for businesses and consumers.
While the share of Americans with jobs has barely budged and other economic indicators remain weak at best, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has doubled since the Fed announced its first round of bond purchases in November 2008. Interest rates on mortgages and car loans are near the lowest levels on record. Average yields on junk bonds fell below 5 percent for the first time. Corporations with strong credit ratings, like Apple, also are borrowing vast sums at little cost.
Still, for all the daring, some critics argue that the Fed is not trying hard enough. "It's as if we went to the biggest fire we've ever seen and we poured more water on it than we've ever poured, and the fire isn't completely out," said Joseph E. Gagnon, a former Fed economist now at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. "Well, we should try more water."
Officials in Britain, too, are debating its central bank's ability to do more.
Last month, the departing governor of the Bank of England, Mervyn King, gave a speech at the International Monetary Fund in which he said -- a bit acidly -- that there was a limit to what monetary policy could do to spur recovery in a country like Britain, where a small number of stingy banks dominate the economy and the government is tightening its spending.
Like other central banks around the world, the Bank of England, by far the oldest of them all, has done its part to ward off a depression. It has bought, to date, the equivalent of $569 billion worth of government bonds -- a bold use of the printing press for an institution known for its hidebound ways.
This shock treatment, the professorial Mr. King pointed out, equaled 20 percent of the British economy, outpacing the central bank interventions of the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan and the Federal Reserve.
And what does Mr. King have to show for his monetary exertions -- beyond record stock market highs and bottom-scraping yields for British corporate bonds? An anemic recovery. Growth this year is expected to be 0.5 percent, according to the monetary fund, while Japan's gross domestic product grew at an annualized rate of 3.5 percent in the first quarter and the United States' is expected to grow a little more than 2 percent.
"There is a limit to what the central bank can achieve," said Robert Wood, chief economist for Britain at Berenberg Bank in London, who worked previously at the Bank of England. "Britain's problem is that it is still paying for its past sins -- simply wishing we could be where we were before the crisis is just not going to happen."
Japan's willingness to use huge government spending -- despite racking up incredible debt to do so -- is unique among the developed economies.
Under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, the country is coupling its central bank action with fiscal stimulus, which means that the new money created by the bank is put to use. Calls for austerity have largely fallen on deaf ears. In the land famous for building bridges to nowhere, Mr. Abe pushed through an emergency stimulus package of 10 trillion yen, or $98.7 billion, and Parliament passed a further 92.6 trillion yen budget for 2013, with heavy spending on public works.
But in a happy confluence of policies, because the central bank promises to buy up the bonds that the government issues, interest rates are for now unlikely to soar out of control, while the weakening yen has created a surge in exporter profits, putting Japan in a policy sweet spot.
All eyes are now on Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank. A creative and determined central banker, he must find some unconventional way to prevent Europe from becoming stuck in the economic rut that held back Japan for most of two decades.
An interest rate cut in early May is unlikely to do much to promote the flow of credit to countries like Italy, Greece, Portugal and Spain. Even with the benchmark rate at 0.5 percent, down from 0.75 percent, cheap money is not persuading banks to lend and businesses to borrow.
There is fear that Germany and other countries like Austria and Finland are about to be swallowed by the recession that has afflicted Southern Europe for more than a year and has just reached France. Unemployment in the euro zone is 12.1 percent, and in Greece and Spain more than a quarter of the work force is jobless.
The European Central Bank faces legal and political restraints that make it harder for the bank to imitate the other major central banks. It cannot finance governments, which limits its ability to buy any country's bonds. Mr. Draghi has argued that doing so in any case would not accomplish much in the euro zone because most companies get their credit from banks rather than by issuing corporate bonds.
"It is different from the United States," Mr. Draghi told reporters after the bank's governing council met this month in Bratislava, Slovakia.
"In the United States, 80 percent of credit intermediation goes via the capital markets," he said. "In the European situation it is the other way round. Eighty percent of financial intermediation goes through the banking system. So, you are left with buying what?"
The European Central Bank is sworn to guard price stability above all else, so it is extremely cautious about any effort to inflate the currency, even as inflation in the euro zone is 1.2 percent and falling. But other central banks, operating under similar mandates, have concluded that deflation is now a greater concern.
Falling prices can freeze economic activity as buyers wait for still-lower prices, a cycle that is hard to reverse. Japan, the only major economy to fall into such a pattern in modern times, has struggled to escape for almost two decades.
Marie Diron, a former European Central Bank economist who now advises the consulting firm Ernst & Young, said, "The Japan scenario is a risk."
On his trip to Frankfurt, Mr. Bullard told an audience at Goethe University that Europe needed to act. "The lesson of Japan is that once you get stuck, it's very hard to get out."
"One way to get stuck," he said, "would be not to take aggressive action."

Full text:   HONG KONG -- The Japanese central bank on Monday released minutes of a recent meeting that showed some board members skeptical of the bank's own strategy of lifting Japan from deflation, while another big fall in the country's stock market stoked fears of further volatility in the weeks and months ahead.
But European stocks shrugged off the slide on the Japanese stock market Monday and traded higher as a member of the European Central Bank repeated the bank's commitment to low interest rates. Stock markets in Britain and the United States were closed for public holidays.
In Tokyo, the minutes of the Bank of Japan's policy meeting on April 26 revealed a degree of doubt about the bank's ability to inject a healthy dose of inflation into an economy that has suffered from crippling deflation for years.
According to the minutes, "a few members" pointed out that the goal of 2 percent inflation appeared "difficult to achieve" in the planned time frame of about two years, "since it was highly uncertain whether changes in inflation expectations would lead to a rise in the actual rate of inflation."
Some board members also noted that the bank's aggressive easing policies appeared to have been perceived by the markets as "contradictory" -- comments that highlighted the challenges that the bank and policy makers are wrestling with.
The bank, on one hand, has committed to ending deflationary expectations and starting an economic recovery by flooding the economy with money, which would cause long-term interest rates to rise. But the bank has also committed to keeping those interest rates in check, partly by buying large amounts of government bonds. That has sowed confusion among market players over whether they should welcome or worry about the recent rise in long-term rates.
On Monday, the Nikkei 225 share average in Tokyo fell 3.2 percent. The decline came after a 7.3 percent slump last Thursday, when a rally that started in mid-November of 2012, with stocks rising nearly 80 percent, came to an abrupt end.
"While it's still difficult to clearly pinpoint a reason, the big market falls themselves have started to stoke fear among investors," Koichi Fujishiro, an economist at the Dai-ichi Life Research Institute, said in a report. He said that high-frequency trading by investors looking for short-term gains helped magnify those market swings.
"Japan's fundamentals have not changed," Mr. Fujishiro said. But, he added, "turmoil in financial markets won't settle down overnight, and we are likely to see nervousness remain for some time."
An article carried by the Nikkei business daily on Monday urged calm.
"Investors need a bird's-eye perspective of market movements, not a bug's-eye perspective," wrote Ryo Suzuki, a columnist who is a member of Nikkei's editorial board. "Things look different from a larger perspective," he said. "For people who sat out on the market surge, this might be a good time to get in on the action."
Japanese stocks have been on a tear since last November, swept by a wave of optimism that bold plans outlined by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who took over in December, would succeed in breathing life back into the Japanese economy.
Volatility in the Japanese bond markets, a renewed strengthening of the yen and concern about the dynamism of China's economy all have combined in recent days to underline the challenges facing Mr. Abe and the Japanese central bank as they seek to renew growth.
Analysts have struggled to explain the exact cause of the recent reversal, saying that a range of factors were probably at play and continue to fan nervousness in the market.
"There have been times when the market jumped over 1,000 points in a week. We were bound to see a correction," Yoshihide Suga, the chief cabinet secretary, told reporters in Tokyo. "But Japan's economy is recovering steadily. So it is extremely important that we react in a calm manner."
Investors are also concerned that the United States Federal Reserve might reduce its own stimulus measures before too long.
The realization that Mr. Abe's stimulus efforts -- in particular, the structural overhauls that are needed to bolster Japan's long-term competitiveness -- face a struggle also have played a part, analysts said, as did profit-taking after the long rally this year.
"Investors have realized that the Japanese market does not just rise and rise," said Jun Yunoki, an analyst at Nomura in Tokyo.

Full text:   THE state of the economy is far from ideal, but some very definite positives are brewing. It's not just that we are continuing to recover from a deep recession; we are also seeing signs that America's long-term future may be looking up, too.
The case for optimism is hardly open-and-shut. The economy's problems include high unemployment, mediocre productivity gains and stagnant or slow-growing earnings for most income classes. Still, let's consider five indicators that the future is starting to brighten:
MORE DIPLOMAS The nation's high school graduation rate has risen -- to 78 percent in 2010, the Education Department says in its most recent estimate. That's obviously still not where it should be, but it's the highest figure since 1974. (For a long time, the rate was under 70 percent. After decades of stagnation, the graduation rate started to turn up in 2000, and the growth has been robust for more than a decade.)
On average, these additional high school graduates -- not to mention college degree recipients -- will find better jobs and enjoy better health, long-lasting benefits that will be reaped for many decades.
NEW KNOWLEDGE, LESS COST When it comes to education, an even greater productivity gain may be on the way. This month, for instance, the Georgia Institute of Technology announced a new online master's degree in computer science, for a price of no more than $7,000.
It's part of a trend toward less expensive education and certification. The examples are numerous: the Khan Academy offers free online instruction in mathematics and other topics, and Coursera and other companies have popularized online courses for millions of users.
How far these trends can be pushed is unclear, but it can no longer be argued that the basic technologies of education haven't changed in decades or even centuries.
LOWER HEALTH CARE INFLATION The growth rate in health care costs has been slowing for the last four years. In some years, in fact, it's been no higher than the growth rate of the economy as a whole. And much of the change appears driven by efficiencies, rather than by the recent recession. This is documented in a paper by David M. Cutler, an economics professor at Harvard, and Nikhil R. Sahni, a fellow at Harvard Business School; it appeared in the May 2013 issue of Health Affairs.
This cost deceleration isn't guaranteed to stick, but the danger that sharply rising health care costs, compounding over time, will crash the entire economy is now somewhat reduced.
POWERING AMERICA FOR LESS We appear to be at the start of a new era of cheap energy. Through advances in both oil and natural gas production, the United States is again becoming a leading exporter of fossil fuels.
Many of the nation's economic troubles, like slow productivity and income growth, began about the same time that America's first age of cheap energy came to a sudden end, in the early 1970s. The effect of today's energy boom on broader productivity remains to be seen, but it could prove a source of further gains. Unfortunately, cheap natural gas isn't the path toward sustainable green energy, although it is cleaner than coal and has helped the nation make some progress in reducing emissions.
MOBILIZING THE CREATIVE This final development, concerning the fate of talent in lesser-developed nations, is perhaps the most fundamental. If you were born a genius in Shanghai in 1960, for example, your chances of making much contribution to the larger world were small, because China was largely isolated back then -- and extremely unfree economically. It now does a much better job of mobilizing its considerable natural talent.
While the populations of countries like the United States are aging, the number of innovative young people worldwide has never been higher. Countries like China, India, Brazil and Russia, despite recent slowdowns in growth, still are making progress in improving their educational systems and scientific networks. That increases their ability to supply technological innovations -- or scientists and entrepreneurs -- to the United States. These gains can be reaped in coming decades.
Note, too, that none of these trends can be reduced to breathless or utopian claims about the future of information technology, even though each is intertwined with tech progress in subtle ways. Further breakthroughs in technology, perhaps in the field of quantum computing, could add substantially to these positive trends.
The first decade of this century was largely a lost one, economically speaking, for the average American household. And in the beginning of this decade, median household income has actually dropped, during a time of ostensible economic recovery. Yet the longer-run picture, finally, can be given a partly optimistic gloss. These trends may not ultimately be the dominant ones, but if we're looking for a positive narrative about the American economic future, some important pieces are starting to fall into place.

Amid Deflation Fight, Japan Keeps to Its Bold Policy

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDEDTOKYO -- The Bank of Japan stood pat on monetary policy Wednesday amid market anxiety over volatility in bond markets, which has threatened to undermine the country's battle to end deflation and stimulate growth in the giant economy.
In a unanimous vote, the bank's board stuck to its strategy of expanding the monetary base at an annual pace of 60 trillion yen to 70 trillion yen, or $586 billion to $684 billion, through purchases of government bonds, commercial debt and other assets.
Haruhiko Kuroda, the bank's new governor, pledged to "respond flexibly" to the recent moves in Japanese government bond yields, as markets "searched for a new equilibrium." He stressed that there was no cause for immediate concern.
"Yields are up, but at this stage there is no large impact on the real economy," Mr. Kuroda said at a news conference after the bank's decision.
He said that the central bank would continue to make large bond purchases to "keep up the downward pressure on interest rates." He has also suggested that the bank would adjust the way it bought bonds in the market.
At its first policy meeting under Mr. Kuroda last month, the bank unleashed what analysts have called a "shock and awe" monetary policy, a sea change for a bank that had come to be known in recent years for its caution and conservatism.
Declaring he would do "whatever it takes" to combat falling prices, Mr. Kuroda announced that the bank would seek to double Japan's monetary base, as well as the bank's holdings of Japanese government bonds, by the end of 2014.
In recent days, worries have grown about rising interest rates in the government bond market, which could threaten Japan's monetary policy. Japan is vulnerable to rising borrowing costs because of its high public debt, which is twice the size of its economy. Bonds are also the main financial asset held by banks, pension funds and insurance companies, making a surge in debt yields perilous.
The scale of Japan's quantitative easing is striking. Assuming that the Japanese economy grows by 2 percent a year, the Bank of Japan would expand its assets to just under 60 percent of the country's gross domestic product, according to estimates from CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets.
The assets of the Federal Reserve, which now total about 20 percent of the American economy, and the European Central Bank's assets, which come to about 28 percent of the euro zone's G.D.P., pale in comparison.
Japan stands out in another important way. Under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who took office in December and has been the main champion of the bank's new boldness, Japan is coupling its monetary push with heavy government spending.
Barely two months into office, Mr. Abe pushed through an emergency stimulus package of 10 trillion yen, and last week the Japanese Parliament passed an initial budget of 92.6 trillion yen for 2013, with heavy spending on public works.
By contrast, the Fed and the European Central Bank have been forced to depend on monetary policy alone to stave off stagnation and bring about an economic recovery. In both the United States and Europe, a significant increase in government spending remains controversial.
Still, critics have pointed to Japan's skyrocketing public debt as proof that such spending is not sustainable. The latest spending packages, they say, will be the final push that could send Japan plummeting into a Europe-like debt crisis. Defenders of the bank's monetary policy had argued that Japan's bold stimulus efforts would not push interest rates higher, because the central bank promises to buy bonds the government issues.
But in recent days, yields have been volatile, with the key 10-year nominal government bond yield hitting five-year highs last week before later settling down. Traders blamed the central bank's purchases, saying they created a lack of liquidity in bond markets.
"We think Kuroda has done a great job in boosting asset prices by raising asset price inflation expectation, but he now has to calm down the sentiment in bond market," Masaaki Kanno, chief economist at JPMorgan Securities Japan, said in a research note. "This is quite challenging."
Correction: May 24, 2013, Friday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Thursday about the Bank of Japan's monetary policy strategy gave outdated information on the status of the latest budget in the Japanese Parliament. The budget passed last week; it was not "expected to pass."

Abstract: Community colleges and four-year colleges have both suffered in recent years from state budget cuts, said Sandy Baum, a senior fellow at the George Washington University Graduate School of Education and Human Development.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Community colleges have received a declining share of government spending on higher education over the last decade even as their student bodies have become poorer and more heavily African-American and Latino, according to a report to be released Thursday.
"Many community colleges end up receiving minimal federal support," said Richard D. Kahlenberg, a senior fellow at the Century Foundation, which is publishing the report. "The kids with the greatest needs receive the fewest resources."
The report argues that colleges have become increasingly separate and unequal, evoking the Supreme Court's landmark Brown v. Board of Education decision in 1954, which barred racial segregation in elementary and secondary schools. Higher education today, the report says, is stratified between four-year colleges with high graduation rates that serve largely affluent students and community colleges with often dismal graduation rates that serve mostly low-income students.
In 2009, community colleges spent $9,300 per student on educational resources, virtually unchanged from 1999 once inflation was taken into account. Public research universities spent $16,700, up 11 percent from 1999, and private research universities spent $41,000, an increase of 31 percent.
Community colleges often receive substantially less money per student than elementary or high schools, said Sara Goldrick-Rab, a University of Wisconsin professor who served on the 22-member committee that wrote the report.
The other members included the chancellor of Syracuse University, the president of the New York Public Library and three community college presidents.
Community colleges, which enroll about 44 percent of the nation's college students, will play a major role in determining how quickly educational attainment rises in the United States, experts say. While the United States once led the world in educational attainment by a wide margin, it has fallen behind some other rich countries over the past generation.
President Obama has called for the country to regain its lead by 2020, and community colleges would probably have to improve significantly for that goal to be met.
Although 81 percent of new students at community colleges say they want to transfer to a four-year college and earn a bachelor's degree, only 12 percent do so within six years, according to the report. Most entering students also fail to receive a two-year degree, although some community colleges have compiled an impressive record of graduating low-income students.
Community colleges began in the early 20th century, known then as junior colleges, and expanded rapidly in the 1960s. They became not only steppingstones to four-year colleges but also places that trained students for specific jobs, like nurses, paralegals or engineering technicians.
The largest, each with tens of thousands of students, include Miami Dade College; Northern Virginia Community College; City College of San Francisco; Lone Star College, in Houston; and Kingsborough Community College, in Brooklyn.
The report describes a network of federal and state educational policies that has failed to keep pace with the increasing enrollment of lower-income students in higher education. The largest federal financial aid program -- Pell grants, which go to lower-income students to offset tuition -- does relatively little to help community colleges because their tuition tends to be low.
"In the 20th century, going to college was not necessary for getting a job in the middle class," said Eduardo J. Padrón, the president of Miami Dade College and a co-chairman of the 22-member committee. "But in today's job market, if you don't have a postsecondary credential, you can't get a job that lets you achieve the American dream. It keeps you in a cycle of poverty."
Community colleges and four-year colleges have both suffered in recent years from state budget cuts, said Sandy Baum, a senior fellow at the George Washington University Graduate School of Education and Human Development. But four-year colleges have made up some of the shortfall through tuition increases, while community colleges have not increased tuition as rapidly.
The financing gap, Ms. Goldrick-Rab said, "is contributing to really appalling completion rates."
The report recommended a series of policy changes, including more transparency about who benefits from federal education spending; more outcome-based financing, to reward colleges that do the best job with challenging students; and programs to make community colleges economically diverse. Community colleges could create more honors programs, including classes for high school students, and four-year colleges could set aside more slots for community college transfers, the authors said.
Other research has found that poor students tend to fare worse, all else equal, when enrolled in a school made up mostly of poor students. Yet over the last generation, higher education appears to have become more stratified.
In 2006, 28 percent of community college students came from the bottom quartile of the socioeconomic distribution, up from 21 percent in 1982. Only 16 percent of community college students came from the top quartile in 2006, down from 24 percent in 1982.
By comparison, only about 5 percent of students at the 200 most selective four-year colleges came from the bottom quartile in 2006, according to Anthony P. Carnevale and Jeff Strohl, of the Center on Education and the Workforce, at Georgetown University.

Full text:   CARACAS, Venezuela -- There may be no honor among thieves, but there certainly is no shortage of chutzpah.
First came the hefty kickbacks that employees at a Miami brokerage office pledged to pay María de los Angeles González, a Venezuelan banking official, for steering millions of dollars of business their way -- which she did, federal prosecutors contend.
Then Ms. González's American conspirators secretly shortchanged her on the agreed-upon bribes, lying to her about how many millions they made and delivering just a fraction of the illicit profits she was promised, according to court documents filed in New York this month.
If that were not enough, one of the Americans even insisted that Ms. González reimburse him for a portion of his income tax, arguing that Uncle Sam was unfairly taxing him on money he had passed on to her as bribes.
And she paid him, court papers say.
But the real loser in what prosecutors described as a $66 million scheme appears to be the Venezuelan government, which controls the bank where Ms. González worked. It was duped into forking over huge overcharges on financial transactions to line the conspirators' pockets, according to the court papers.
Ms. González and two of the brokerage employees were arrested in Miami this month, and federal authorities in the United States are taking steps to seize property linked to the defendants' dealings, including Swiss bank accounts and four Florida condominiums that officials say were bought with illicit proceeds.
Financial fraud is common enough in both countries, but the scandal has generated headlines at a particularly sensitive time in Venezuela, throwing open a window onto what critics call endemic government corruption.
The nation's new president, Nicolás Maduro, was elected last month in a special election to replace the country's longtime president, Hugo Chávez, who died in March.
But his narrow margin of victory, just 1.5 percentage points, has left him weakened, and if the scandal were to spread it could undermine him further as the nation struggles with a deepening economic crisis characterized by high inflation and shortages of basic foods and other goods, like toilet paper.
At the center of the case is Ms. González, 55, alternately identified as vice president of finance and as executive manager of finance and funds administration of the Economic and Social Development Bank of Venezuela, known as Bandes, an arm of the government. She has a long career in private and government-run banks, and her possible ties to current and former government officials suggest that the case has the potential to shake the political establishment.
Shortly after winning the election, Mr. Maduro appointed the head of the development bank, Edmée Betancourt, to be the new president of Venezuela's Central Bank. A previous president of the development bank, Alejandro Andrade, who led the institution at the time the suspected fraud is said to have begun, was a close ally of Mr. Chávez and is still considered to be a major power broker. He also held the post of national treasurer at the time he ran the development bank.
The court papers indicate that at least one other official at the bank besides Ms. González received kickbacks as part of the scheme. But that official, whose title appears as "Treasury Management" in an e-mail cited in the court papers, is not named in the documents and is not charged.
"It's a news item, just a news item," said Temir Porras, who was named last week to lead the development bank. He said the public prosecutor's office would investigate to see "if there is some type of punishable offense."
But others here were quick to see in the banking scandal signs of a deeper problem.
"What the case of Bandes shows is the impunity that reigns in Venezuela," said Carlos Tablante, a former legislator and governor. "This has to be investigated deeply, not for the amount of money it represents in bribes, but to look for networks of corruption."
Venezuela had the lowest ranking of any country in the Western Hemisphere last year in an index compiled by Transparency International, a group that campaigns against corruption, meaning that Venezuela was perceived as the most corrupt.
The bribery scheme began in 2008, according to a criminal complaint by the office of Preet Bharara, who is the United States attorney in Manhattan, and a civil complaint by the Securities and Exchange Commission, both filed in federal court.
The papers contend that employees of the Miami office of the brokerage firm, Direct Access Partners, which has its headquarters in New York, struck a deal with Ms. González: She agreed to steer the development bank's lucrative bond trading business to the firm in exchange for kickbacks.
The brokerage employees agreed to pay Ms. González at least half of the grossly inflated fees they planned to charge the bank for routine transactions, according to the federal filings.
But, the complaints said, the employees routinely lied to Ms. González about the size of those fees, sharply cutting her kickbacks and increasing their share of the illicit take, the papers said.
In one trade, in August 2009, the brokerage firm charged an $875,000 markup, but the employees told Ms. González that it made just $125,000, according to the S.E.C. She was paid $62,500, the S.E.C. said, although her deal called for her to get at least half of the firm's full markup.
Nonetheless, Ms. González, whom the brokerage employees nicknamed "the ant" (they called the other bank employee who received bribes "passion fruit"), received as much as $9 million from 2009 through June 2010, the S.E.C. charged.
In the scheme's most audacious maneuver, authorities said, the brokerage firm twice bought a large quantity of bonds from the bank and sold them back to the bank at an inflated price on the same day. The two round-trip transactions generated $10.5 million in revenue for the brokerage firm while providing only a loss to the bank.
The authorities say that those transactions and many others generated millions of dollars for the brokerage firm, paid partly in the form of bonuses and other compensation to two of its employees, Tomas Clarke, 43, and Jose Alejandro Hurtado, 38, and that the men passed on a portion of that money to Ms. González, using a web of companies and bank accounts in the United States, Panama and Switzerland. Court papers show that other executives at the firm also received large amounts from the trades in question, and that the S.E.C. investigation is continuing. The firm did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
At one point in 2010, Mr. Hurtado complained to Ms. González, that the subterfuge had increased his income tax payments and insisted that she return to him $709,989.
Ms. González was surprisingly sympathetic. "Now I understand your bad mood when you spoke to the accountant," she wrote to Mr. Hurtado in an e-mail quoted in the court papers. "That Uncle Sam is baaaaaad. You work and he charges. He makes you crazy." Ms. González then transferred to Mr. Hurtado the money he requested, the court papers say.
Mr. Hurtado and Mr. Clarke were charged with violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; the two men and Ms. González were charged with money laundering and with using foreign or interstate travel to commit a crime.

Full text:   FRANKFURT -- A top official of the Federal Reserve on Tuesday urged the European Central Bank to take more aggressive action to restart growth, warning that the euro area risked becoming mired in the same kind of economic stagnation that has plagued Japan for two decades, with far-reaching implications for the global economy.
James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis and a voting member of the Fed's policy-setting open markets committee, said Europe's central bank should consider quantitative easing similar to that undertaken by the Fed -- large bond purchases meant to drive down market interest rates.
The public comments were highly unusual. While central bankers from different countries frequently confer in private and offer advice and criticism to their peers behind closed doors, it is rare for any official to go public with even the mildest criticism of another central bank.
But with official interest rates in almost every advanced economy already close to zero, Mr. Bullard said, central bankers must reach for stronger tools to avoid getting trapped in economic doldrums.
"The lesson of Japan is that once you get stuck, it's very hard to get out," Mr. Bullard told an audience at Goethe University in Frankfurt. "One way to get stuck would be not to take aggressive action."
Mr. Bullard sent a message to Wall Street not to expect the Fed to begin rolling back its own quantitative easing program soon, saying that there was no sign of inflation risk, and that even if there were, the central bank could deal with it.
"We just haven't seen it so far," Mr. Bullard said of inflation. And when it starts to appear, he added, "we know how to fight that problem -- we can raise rates."
Mr. Bullard spoke ahead of meetings in Frankfurt with some of his European counterparts, including Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank. Mr. Bullard said he was speaking for himself and not the Fed or any other members of its policy committee.
Still, his remarks represented one of the strongest public statements yet from a Washington policy maker in response to increasing concern that European leaders were reacting too timidly to a spreading recession.
A sluggish European economy has global implications, Mr. Bullard said. "You have to be concerned," he told the group. "The European Union as a whole is the biggest economy in the world."
A move by the European Central Bank to buy government bonds on a grand scale would certainly face harsh opposition from the Bundesbank, the conservative and influential German central bank that, while officially under the European Central Bank, wields outsize influence because of its historical role as defender of the German currency and as Europe's bastion of anti-inflation fervor.
The European Central Bank has given no signals that it is seriously considering quantitative easing.
There are also practical hurdles to emulating Fed policy in Europe. There is no pan-European government bond similar to United States Treasuries. Mr. Bullard said the solution would be to buy bonds of all 17 governments in the euro zone in proportion to their size.
With the official euro zone interest rate at a record low of 0.5 percent, below the rate of inflation, the central bank has been groping for ways to stimulate the slumping European economy. Mr. Draghi has floated the idea of a negative deposit rate -- in effect charging banks to keep their reserves at the central bank as a way to prod them into lending more money to businesses and consumers.
Mr. Bullard said a negative deposit rate would be a "dead-end policy." It would not have much effect and could be done only once, he said.

A Keynesian Victory, But Austerity Stands Firm

Full text:   To go by the statements of most mainstream economists, one would be forgiven for believing this is the best of times for Keynesian economics.
Fans of John Maynard Keynes, the renowned early 20th-century economist who developed the theory on how nations could dig themselves out of an economic downturn, have been running victory laps since the collapse last month of the claim by the Harvard economists Carmen M. Reinhart and Kenneth S. Rogoff that economies tend to slow significantly after government debt reaches 90 percent of gross domestic product.
Then, as if on cue, the number-crunchers in Brussels announced last week that the economy of the euro area countries -- which have been following a decidedly non-Keynesian path -- shrank yet again at the beginning of the year. It was the region's sixth quarterly contraction in a row.
The confluence of events provided further evidence of Keynes's central proposition: when consumers and businesses set out to reduce their debt burden, and private spending and investment stall, it is the government's job to borrow, spend and pick up the slack.
The claim by Ms. Reinhart and Mr. Rogoff had provided an intellectual foundation to the demand by House Republicans, British Tories and Germans that indebted governments should move quickly to reduce their budget deficits and the burden of debt.
Its demise -- at the hands of a graduate student from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, who discovered flaws in the Harvard economists' methods -- left a more modest assertion in its wake: heavily indebted nations grow more slowly. Yet it is not even clear that debt necessarily depresses growth. The track record from Europe and elsewhere suggests that austerity programs that hold back growth often make the debt burden even worse.
Two economists -- Lawrence H. Summers of Harvard, President Obama's former chief economic adviser; and Brad DeLong of the University of California, Berkeley -- proposed in a recent paper that at the rock-bottom interest rates that prevail today, government spending to encourage growth would in fact pay for itself. In the United States, they concluded, it would lighten the nation's future debt burden -- not increase it.
But in many ways it is the worst of times for Keynesian economists. For despite all this intellectual firepower, governments across the industrial world are zealously tightening their belts.
The Italian government has cut its annual budget deficit to 3 percent of G.D.P. last year from 5.5 percent in 2009, and the Irish government has slashed it to 7.6 percent from 13.9 percent. In Britain -- which has its own currency and is freer than its euro-area neighbors to set policy -- the government of Prime Minister David Cameron reduced the deficit to 6.3 percent of G.D.P. last year, down from 11.5 percent in 2009.
"We will not be able to build a sustainable recovery with long-term growth," Mr. Cameron said in a speech in March, "unless we fix this fundamental problem of excessive government spending and borrowing that undermines our whole economy."
The German government is running a budget surplus. And despite the public's belief that Washington is engaged in a spending spree, the deficit in the United States narrowed to 7 percent of G.D.P. in 2012 from 10.1 percent in 2009.
None of these countries are growing much, mind you. In the United States, unemployment is still stuck at 7.5 percent. In its latest economic forecast last month, the International Monetary Fund predicted that the nation's economy would grow only 1.9 percent this year, slowed by further budget-cutting.
What explains the gap between theoretical victory and policy defeat? Voters appear to want everything -- including more jobs and a smaller deficit. Is resistance to fiscal stimulus simply a matter of political tactics? Do Republicans automatically oppose anything coming from a Democratic administration they loathe?
Economists have articulated other tempting possibilities. One is that moral views are getting in the way of reason: the decisions of both elected officials and voters are driven not by economic research but by a belief in the virtue of thrift drawn from The Ant and the Grasshopper.
Another is that policy serves the interests of moneyed creditors, lenders who fear that heavily indebted governments will be tempted to default, permit higher inflation to erode the debt's real value or tax the wealthy more heavily in the future.
N. Gregory Mankiw of Harvard, a former chief economic adviser to President George W. Bush, has proposed another reason, rooted in a notion of democratic rule.
"If the goal of government is to express the collective will of the citizenry, shouldn't it follow the lead of those it represents by tightening its own belt?" he wrote in a recent paper. "If we as individual citizens are feeling poorer and cutting back on our spending, why should our elected representatives in effect reverse these private decisions by increasing spending and going into debt on our behalf?"
These propositions probably hold some truth. Yet they rely on a misdiagnosis of our economic circumstances. The world's recent experience suggests fairly strongly that excessive thrift will make us all poorer. If everybody stops consuming and starts saving at the same time, there will be a lot fewer jobs producing stuff to consume.
There are two additional arguments that rely less on a misreading of economics. The first, which applies primarily to the euro area, has to do with the distribution of the costs of fiscal stimulus and austerity.
The idea that austerity is the solution for the economic crisis in Greece, Spain, Italy and other weak economies of the euro area is appealing in Germany precisely because it demands sacrifices of the citizens of the periphery. Keynesian stimulus would require German money.
The other argument derives from a seemingly myopic conflation of the short and the long term: worried about the scary rise of Social Security and Medicare spending in future decades, voters demand budget cuts now.
This self-defeating demand is the main driver of economic policy in the United States today.
Yet the voters' position is not irrational. Americans' unwillingness to support more spending now comes from an entirely reasonable mistrust of the government's willingness to cut spending later.
Fortunately, there is a way to square the circle, if only our political masters could overcome their partisan animus to embrace it. The answer is to combine some stimulus in the present -- via tax cuts or more public spending -- with transparent, legally binding initiatives to limit spending in the future.
For instance, the administration could propose raising the retirement age a decade down the road. It could also save a lot of money by rejiggering Medicare's cost-sharing formulas. The higher-income elderly could be made to shoulder a larger share of their health care costs in the future.
Swapping future cuts in Social Security and Medicare for more spending today will not be an easy deal. Liberal Democrats will balk at trimming the social safety net. House Republicans appear immune to any fiscal compromise.
The Obama administration has tried some of this at the margin. It proposed changing the price index used to adjust Social Security benefits, slowing their rise. It has had no success.
But a deal along these lines offers a plausible political path toward an economic policy that is not quite as self-destructive as the one we've got. The goal: Keynesian today, when the economy needs it, but not tomorrow.

Full text:   Reassuring comments from a Federal Reserve official and better earnings from two big retailers helped push the stock market higher on Tuesday.
Stock indexes wobbled between gains and losses in early trading, then took a turn higher just before noon. That's when news outlets reported that James Bullard, president of the Fed's St. Louis branch, had told an audience in Germany that the Fed should continue its bond-buying effort to bolster the economic recovery.
"Those words were a salve for investors' nerves," said Lawrence R. Creatura, a fund manager at Federated Investors. Other Fed officials have recently talked about scaling back the program. "There's a lot of uncertainty surrounding this issue," Mr. Creatura said. "And uncertainty and investors aren't always a happy match."
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 52.30 points, to 15,387.58, a gain of 0.3 percent. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index edged up 2.87 points, to 1,669.16, a 0.2 percent bump. Both the Dow and the S.& P. are at record highs, not factoring for inflation. In addition, the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 5.69 points, to 3,502.12, a 0.2 percent gain.
Many investors were already looking ahead to Wednesday, when the Federal Reserve will release minutes from its most recent policy meeting and its chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, will go before Congress to discuss his economic outlook.
"I think a lot of people are sitting on their hands waiting to see what the Fed says tomorrow," Michael Binger, senior portfolio manager at Gradient Investments in Minneapolis, said on Tuesday.
Mr. Binger said some investors believed that the Fed's support had underpinned the stock market rally. If the Fed pulls back, they reason, the rally would fizzle.
Stock in JPMorgan Chase, the country's top bank, gained 1.4 percent, to $53.02. Shareholders voted on Tuesday to allow Jamie Dimon to keep his two titles, chief executive and chairman.
Home Depot shares rose 2.5 percent, to $78.71, after the company reported an 18 percent increase in quarterly income as the housing market continued to recover.
It has been another solid earnings season for big companies, with corporate profits hitting highs even as revenue barely rises. Seven of every 10 companies in the S.& P. 500 have topped Wall Street's earnings forecasts, according to S&P Capital IQ. First-quarter earnings are on track to climb 5 percent over the year before. Revenue is expected to rise just 1 percent.
In the market for United States government bonds, the price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 10/32, to 98 12/32, and the yield slipped to 1.93 percent, from 1.97 percent late Monday.
