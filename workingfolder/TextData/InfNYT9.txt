Full text: It has been nearly two years since the Federal Reserve began to raise its core interest rate, yet income investors in the United States are still waiting for a tailwind to kick in. Those who are willing to bear additional risk might turbocharge their returns with emerging market bond funds, an often ignored slice of the fixed income sector that lately has delivered a combination of high yield and high total returns.
The iShares J.P. Morgan USD Emerging Markets Bond, for example, pays a 4.5 percent yield and delivered a total return of more than 9 percent through the first nine months of the year. By comparison, the iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond E.T.F., an exchange-traded fund that invests in a broad slice of the investment-grade domestic bond market, pays a 2.5 percent yield and gained 3.1 percent in the same period.
Emerging market bonds denominated in local currency have had an especially good run recently as a slump this year in the dollar increased the purchasing power of other currencies. The Pimco Emerging Local Bond fund has a 5.2 percent yield and a total return of more than 14 percent through the end of September. (Total return is the combination of yield plus any change in the value of a portfolio's bonds.)
Valuations are stretched after average gains of nearly 25 percent since early 2016, and rising rates in the United States would hurt bond prices. Yet many emerging market bond fund managers make a bullish case.
"For the first time since the financial crisis, we've got commodities stabilizing and a global growth story," said Penelope Foley, a manager of TCW Emerging Markets Income fund. Emerging market companies are also reporting stronger earnings, which can make it easier to repay debt.
These fund managers do not expect the Fed's actions to muck up the landscape.
"It depends why the Fed is tightening," said Samy Muaddi, manager of T. Rowe Price Emerging Markets Corporate Bond fund. "If it's because the U.S. is adding 200,000 jobs a month, that's wonderful for emerging markets." Economic growth that is strong enough for the Fed to try to pull rates a bit closer to normal should not be confused with rapid and steep rate increases meant to combat runaway inflation, he said.
The upshot is that even if rates rise in the United States, emerging markets can remain appealing as long as the global economic outlook remains positive because they offer higher yields.
Consider that investment-grade United States bonds with a five-year maturity currently yield 2.4 percent and that comparable eurozone bonds yield less than 1 percent. Yet similar-term bonds from India, Indonesia and Mexico have yields of at least 6.5 percent.
In a recent report, Brian Nick, chief investment strategist at TIAA Investments, wrote that over the past 20 years emerging market bonds had annualized gains of 6.9 percent when rates were rising in the United States, while an index of core American bonds lost 3.3 percent on average.
Tina Vandersteel, a leader of the asset management firm GMO's emerging market debt team, said that after the recent strong run, her institutional clients said they would probably have to "rebalance away from us. But that hasn't happened much."
One reason is GMO's track record. The GMO Emerging Country Debt IV fund's 12.9 percent annualized gain over the past 15 years is three percentage points better than that of the average emerging market bond fund. Another reason is a lack of compelling alternative investments.
What may appeal to institutional clients requires careful consideration for 401(k) savers. The geopolitical risk that comes with investing in emerging markets means such fixed-income investments are not equivalent to those held in prudent, high-grade, core United States bond funds.
Beyond the risks within specific countries, China, a major trade partner for other emerging markets, casts a long shadow. If China has problems, other countries probably will, too.
"It's a daisy chain in how these economies work," said Kathy Jones, chief fixed income strategist at Charles Schwab. "China not being able to work its way out of its slowdown could have repercussions."
If you have not paid attention to emerging markets for a long while -- since the Latin American debt crisis of the 1980s, for example, or the Asian financial crisis of the 1990s -- it is worth noting that many countries have far more stable economic and monetary policies today.
Many nations now allow their currencies to float, rather than be artificially fixed. They hold much more foreign currency, which may help the next time foreign investors rush for the exits. And their central banks have a stronger hand on the rudder.
Michael Hasenstab, chief investment officer of the Templeton Global Macro group at Franklin Templeton Investments, said in an email that these improvements "were tested and affirmed by impressive resilience during the global financial crisis, with many emerging markets able to avoid recession."
The Templeton Global Bond fund can invest anywhere, and about $25 billion of the nearly $40 billion fund is invested in emerging market bonds. Securities from Brazil, Colombia, India, Indonesia and Mexico are the biggest stakes.
Countries that relied on external trade and investor demand a few decades ago now have growing, consumer-driven, domestic markets and increasing local investment, along with revised economic and monetary policies.
"The label 'emerging markets' is almost unfortunate," Mr. Muaddi of T. Rowe Price said. "It's a label from 25 years ago when emerging markets were 15 countries."
Today, he said, there are 70 emerging market countries, including established ones and their outlier cousins in so-called frontier markets, and all of them have their own idiosyncratic characteristics. "Tajikistan is not Indonesia," Mr. Muaddi said.
About two-thirds of emerging country debt is now rated as investment grade. It is a mix of government bonds, corporate bonds and a combination called quasi-sovereign, which is debt from companies that are state owned. One quasi-sovereign bond issuer popular with emerging market funds is Petróleos Mexicanos, the state-owned Mexican energy company known as Pemex.
Emerging market debt can be issued in local currency, or in a hard "external" currency. That is probably code for dollars, although some emerging market debt is tied to euros or Japanese yen. Even with the recent slide in the dollar, Ms. Vandersteel of GMO said, "local currencies are still cheap."
But predicting currency trends is one of the riskiest aspects of emerging market investing. And when the dollar rises, local-currency bonds tend to suffer. From 2013 through the end of 2015, the dollar gained 25 percent against a basket of currencies, and the average emerging market local currency bond fund lost 23 percent, according to Morningstar.
"If you are going to invest in emerging market bonds you have to ask yourself what risks are you willing to take," Ms. Jones of Charles Schwab said. The iShares J.P. Morgan USD Emerging Markets Bond E.T.F., the largest in its category, tracks an index of United States dollar bonds, eliminating currency risk. VanEck Vectors J.P. Morgan EM Local Currency Bond, on the other had, follows an index of local-currency bonds.
Something else to keep in mind is that emerging market bond indexes often track a small fraction of a targeted market. Old-school active fund management can earn its keep in these sectors. The Fidelity New Markets Income Fund, T. Rowe Price Emerging Markets Bond Fund and TCW Emerging Markets Income Fund hunt among the entire emerging market bond universe, and have the flexibility to mix dollar and local-currency bonds. The annualized returns for all three funds over the past five years is more than a half a percentage point better than the return for the iShares J.P. Morgan USD Emerging Markets Bond E.T.F.
Ms. Jones recommended that investors limit all noncore bond investments to around 10 percent of their fixed-income portfolio.
"Risks exist," she said, warning that volatility in emerging market bonds could be severe. "This is not a short-term trade at this level," she said. You need an investment horizon of at least five years."

Full text: Hurricanes in North America, earthquakes in Latin America, tensions on the Korean Peninsula and political turbulence in the United States, Germany and Spain have produced little but shrugs on Wall Street. The stock market's rise -- not just in the third quarter of 2017 but for eight years -- suggests that traders are convinced the Federal Reserve will meet any meaningful decline with fresh steps to prop stocks up. In the bond market, by contrast, rising yields betray a growing sense that monetary policy will become a headwind.
If that belief spreads to the stock market, fund managers and investment strategists warn, it could disrupt a long bull run that has left stocks expensive by historical yardsticks and more susceptible to a decline.
"Everybody wants to interpret the Fed as having orchestrated a reasonable economic environment on the upside, and that it's going to be equally successful in not getting us into too much trouble on the downside," said Kimberly Scott, a manager of the Ivy Mid Cap Growth fund. "It's silly to make that comfortable assumption. We have to make sure something doesn't sneak up on us."
That something, Ms. Scott said, could be an economy that is "somewhat more strong than people appreciate," leading to a faster pace of rate hikes. That would be especially hard on stocks in high-growth sectors like technology that have been strong performers lately.
She acknowledged that the fund owns "a lot of expensive growth stocks" and said that she was taking some profits and putting the money into areas such as health care and business services.
Tad Rivelle, chief investment officer for fixed income at TCW, expressed the opposite economic concern. After the Fed's September meeting, short-term interest rates rose as long-term bond yields fell, closing the gap between them. In bond market parlance, the yield curve flattened.
If the yield curve goes beyond flattening, into outright inversion, with short rates above long rates, it might be a sign of a recession, so even a flattening yield curve is worrisome.
"It has been often said that the smartest guy in the room is the yield curve," Mr. Rivelle said. The flattening could be "signaling that prospects for growth and inflation are more muted."
Stocks nonetheless reached new highs in the third quarter, unmoved by warnings from Fede officials that monetary policy would be tightening. The benchmark Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 4 percent for the quarter.
The Fed's signals seemed to be taken more seriously in the bond market. Treasury issues rallied initially, then sold off, leaving the 10-year note yielding 2.33 percent at the end of the quarter, compared with 2.3 percent three months earlier and well above its 2.06 percent yield in early September.
Mr. Rivelle advised investors to emphasize shorter-term "securities that focus on more dull parts of the bond market," such as high-quality municipal issues, AAA-rated mortgages and government-guaranteed student loans. He said he was "more skeptical of high-yield and emerging markets."
"If you wanted to take a walk on the wild side," he said, "you should have been doing that in 2010."
Bond funds provided a walk on the mild side in the third quarter, gaining 1.2 percent on average, according to Morningstar. Portfolios focused on emerging-market, local-currency debt performed especially well, rising 3.6 percent. High-yield funds were up 1.8 percent.
The average domestic stock fund returned 4.2 percent, led by a 5.5 percent gain for specialists in larger growth stocks. Technology was the big winner among sector funds, rising 9 percent.
Optimists contend that the Fed's monetary policy has been close to ideal, and that the stock and bond markets are reacting appropriately.
"We have good and solid real economic growth with dissipating inflation," said Ronald Sanchez, chief investment officer of Fiduciary Trust Company International. "Noninflationary growth is positive for both markets. Both are telling you that inflation is modest and, if anything, has started to decline."
Mr. Sanchez said he anticipated a gradual rise in interest rates for the rest of the year and a "shallow rise" in 2018. And while he finds the economic backdrop benign for bonds, he acknowledged that they are "priced for optimal inflation," leaving them at risk if his appraisal is off.
Richard Turnill, global chief investment strategist at BlackRock, thinks that investors are underestimating the economy's staying power and the Fed's commitment to tightening monetary policy.
"Right now we see no signals that tell us the cycle is about to end," he said. "The upshot is we're going to get a steeper yield curve and see bond yields gradually moving higher." As for stocks, he added, "the bottom line is this is still a constructive environment."
Judging by how far the market has risen, Mr. Turnill is not alone in that assessment. But it can hardly be disputed that stocks are expensive. It is not impossible to make a case that valuations are reasonable, but it is difficult. Just how difficult is revealed in recent research by GMO and Deutsche Bank.
A GMO report highlighted the four components of stock returns: earnings growth, dividends, price-earnings ratios and profit margins. It notes that price-earnings ratios and profit margins tend to return to average levels after they deviate appreciably, while earnings growth and dividends tend to track economic growth and account for nearly all long-term returns.
Expanded margins and price-earnings multiples are responsible for more than half of the advance of the present bull run, the report shows. They are all but certain to snap back, probably before long, it warns.
That leads GMO to forecast a decline of 3.9 percent a year for the next seven years for stocks of large American companies, with smaller companies and developed foreign markets doing better, but still losing ground. The only stock markets that GMO expects to produce gains, of 2.9 percent a year, are in emerging economies. Most bonds are expected to lose money, too, with emerging markets again doing best.
Jim Reid, a strategist at Deutsche Bank, echoed the belief that investors had few places to hide. He examined valuations of 15 stock markets and 15 bond markets since 1800 and concluded that "at an aggregate level, an equally weighted bond/equity portfolio has never been more expensive." Bonds alone have never had such rich valuations, meaning low yields, since 1800, he said, and stocks have been more expensive just over 10 percent of the time.
Mr. Reid said the high valuations come at a particularly fraught time, because of "the incredibly unique size of central bank balance sheets, debt levels, multi-century all-time lows in interest rates and even the level of potentially game-changing populist political support around the globe."
Rich valuations were among the factors that prompted warnings in the third quarter of an imminent correction in stocks. In September, Citi Research put the odds that one would begin in the succeeding three months at 45 percent. Citi cited the flattening yield curve and soft growth in earnings, along with the high valuations, in explaining its estimate.
Other firms used snippets of data to argue that a decline was anything but imminent.
Leuthold Group noted that on the 15 previous occasions since 1928 when the S.&P. 500 closed at a 12-month high on any day in September -- the worst month for stocks historically -- and the advance-decline line, a measure of market breadth, also reached a 12-month high, the S.&P. rose 5.9 percent on average during the fourth quarter.
The stock market seldom falls just because it is overvalued; there usually is another catalyst. A more aggressive Fed is one obvious candidate, but not the only one.
Wall Street has been largely unperturbed by North Korea's missile tests, but that would almost certainly change if a war ensues. Efforts to change the federal health care and tax laws remain works in progress -- without much progress -- potentially testing investors' patience. Ramifications of a stronger than expected showing by the far right in Germany's elections and a violent crackdown by the authorities in Spain as Catalonians voted overwhelmingly for independence in a referendum could unnerve the markets, too.
If overvaluation does not cause declines, it exacerbates them once they start. Some investment advisers are gravitating toward foreign markets because they are cheaper and, especially in Europe and Japan, have central banks that continue to flood the economies with cash.
"I think it's very early in their cycle," Mr. Sanchez of Fiduciary Trust said of those markets. "There was a rolling debt crisis in Europe for six or seven years. After having a subdued growth profile, there's some pent-up demand there, especially vis-à-vis the U.S."
The average international stock fund rose a healthy 5.4 percent in the third quarter, led by gains of 7.9 percent in emerging markets, 10.9 percent in China and 18 percent in Latin America.
Mr. Turnill of BlackRock said that investors were "paid to take risk in emerging markets in particular." As for international markets in general, he cited their lower valuations and "higher operational leverage to economic expansion," meaning that earnings of companies there were more sensitive to a pickup in activity than those of American companies.
Both strategists also like American stocks. Mr. Turnill is partial to the technology and financial sectors, while Mr. Sanchez favors larger companies over smaller ones, although he noted that an overhaul of the tax code would benefit smaller companies.
Mr. Sanchez, emphasizing his enthusiasm for stocks, said: "We have good macro, good micro, and financial conditions are as optimal as they possibly can get."
Doesn't that mean things can only get worse? Even if the Fed is steering the economy well enough and North Korea is steering its missiles into open water instead of at people, other adverse developments can pop up and hurt markets that are expensive and therefore vulnerable.
Mr. Sanchez acknowledged that no matter how good the times are, it is still wise to moderate expectations.
"I think market returns will become more modest and more subject to volatility," he said. "I expect more of the same from an economic standpoint, but I think it's very unlikely to expect the risk/return profile we've had to date."

Full text: WASHINGTON -- It is one of the iconic moments in modern economics: A young professor named Arthur Laffer sketched a curve on a bar napkin in 1974 to show an aide to President Gerald R. Ford why the federal government should cut taxes. The Laffer Curve became famous; the Republican Party became the party of tax cuts; and, in 2015, the Smithsonian announced that it was putting the napkin on display.
But the napkin now celebrated for starting a tax revolt is not, in fact, the original napkin, according to the people who were at the fabled meeting at what was then the Two Continents restaurant in Washington. In an interview last week, Mr. Laffer, 77, said it was most likely a keepsake created a few years later.
Among the clues: It is cloth, while the original napkin was paper. It is dated 9/13/74, while the original meeting took place after the November 1974 midterm elections. And it is inscribed to Donald H. Rumsfeld, then Ford's chief of staff. Mr. Laffer met with Dick Cheney, Mr. Rumsfeld's deputy.
Mr. Laffer said that he had drawn on the Smithsonian's napkin, but that he had most likely done so several years later, at the request of the journalist Jude Wanniski, who wanted a keepsake of the famous moment.
The napkin was found among Mr. Wanniski's personal effects after his death in 2005. In a pair of interviews last week, Mr. Laffer said that the Smithsonian had not contacted him before putting the napkin on display, and that he had learned about the exhibit only after the fact. He said he had never before been asked about the napkin's authenticity.
"Look at how neatly it was done!" Mr. Laffer said of the museum napkin, on which he drew his curve, along with a brief explanation. "You tell me how, late at night with a glass of wine, you're going to do it that neatly."
Mr. Laffer's Curve, which illustrates the theory that cutting tax rates can increase tax revenues, is enjoying a revival. The idea played a starring role in Republican campaigns for tax cuts in 1981 under President Ronald Reagan and in 2001 under President George W. Bush. Now Republicans are once again leaning on the Laffer Curve to argue that cutting tax rates would not increase the federal debt.
Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, who has invoked Mr. Laffer's theory during the current debate, keeps on the wall of his personal office a framed napkin illustrated and signed by Mr. Laffer and inscribed "to my friend, Paul Ryan."
The Smithsonian presents its napkin as the tablecloth that started this tax revolt.
"Economist Art Laffer sketched a new direction for the Republican Party on this napkin," the display says, "illustrating his theory that lowering taxes increased economic activity."
Brian Domitrovic, a historian at Sam Houston State University who has studied and written about the creation of the Laffer Curve, said the sum of the available evidence showed that the Smithsonian's napkin was "most certainly an ex post facto creation."
But Peter Liebhold, the curator for the Smithsonian's division of work and industry, who acquired the napkin in 2013, said the museum was confident of its authenticity.
"As you know, oral history is wonderful but subject to problems," he wrote in an email. "The Two Continents meeting happened many years ago, and some of the participants' memories of details may be slightly off. In this case, we have a piece of primary material that clearly documents the occasion. I look forward to your story, but strongly stand by the authenticity of the Smithsonian artifact."
The Laffer napkin has long been shrouded in mystery, partly because none of those present at the original meeting thought that it was particularly historic at the time.
Mr. Wanniski, the hype man of the tax cut movement, was the first to publish an account, in 1978, which he embroidered in multiple retellings. He was working for The Wall Street Journal's editorial page in 1974, and he said that after the Republicans suffered sweeping losses in the 1974 midterm elections, he arranged a meeting between Mr. Laffer, whose ideas he considered important, and Mr. Cheney.
The economy was mired in stagflation, the unfortunate combination of high inflation and high unemployment. Mr. Laffer, then a professor at the University of Chicago, was a leading spokesman for a new school of economic thought, supply-side economics, that saw tax cuts as the best way to increase economic growth while reducing inflation.
The two men met for drinks with Mr. Wanniski in early December at a restaurant across the street from the Treasury Department. Mr. Wanniski also invited Grace-Marie Arnett, a Republican aide who was interested in supply-side economics.
In Mr. Wanniski's account, Mr. Laffer grew frustrated as he tried to explain the value of tax cuts to Mr. Cheney, finally grabbing a paper napkin so he could draw a visual aid. The Laffer Curve, which looks like the nose of an airplane, is meant to show that higher tax rates can reduce tax revenues -- and lower tax rates can bring in more money.
Ms. Arnett, now known as Grace-Marie Turner, said that she recalled the moment vividly because she had never seen the Laffer Curve before, and she found it illuminating.
She said she was certain that the meeting had happened after the elections because until then, she was working for a Republican House candidate in Texas. And, she added, "I absolutely know that it was a paper cocktail napkin."
Mr. Cheney also wrote in his memoirs that the meeting had happened after the midterms.
Mr. Laffer has always said he does not have a clear recollection of the original meeting, but he said that he did not regard the Smithsonian's napkin as the authentic original.
"There was a napkin done and I don't know where it ended; I guess it was probably in the trash," he said. "And Jude Wanniski wanted me to do another example of it two years later, and I believe that this is the napkin that Jude Wanniski asked me to do for him."
Mr. Wanniski never mentioned the cloth napkin in his public writings. In June 2005, shortly before his death, he published an account of the original meeting on his website. He wrote again that Mr. Laffer drew the curve on a cocktail napkin, in December 1974, and he specifically denied that Mr. Rumsfeld was there.
Patricia Koyce Wanniski, his widow, said in an interview that she had found the napkin at the back of a drawer of Mr. Wanniski's clothing after his death.
Why did Mr. Laffer dedicate the napkin to Mr. Rumsfeld and write the date "9/13/74"?
One possible explanation is suggested by Mr. Rumsfeld's 2011 memoir. He wrote that his datebook showed he had dined with Mr. Laffer and Mr. Cheney on Sept. 16, 1975, and that he had made a note at the time that Mr. Laffer drew a curve on a napkin.
Is it possible Mr. Laffer reprised that napkin for Mr. Wanniski, creating a reproduction of a reproduction? Mr. Laffer said he simply was not sure.
"When you get old," he said, "it's hard to say which napkin was which and when and where."

Full text: NEW YORK -- U.S. stock indexes drifted back to record highs Wednesday as investors got ready for another round of corporate reports to begin. Technology, health care and household goods companies all rose. Technology companies like PayPal, Visa, and Google's parent company Alphabet made some of the biggest gains as the market was little changed for the third day in a row. Banks slipped along with interest rates and industrial companies took small losses.
Minutes from the Federal Reserve's September meeting showed officials were split about whether they need to raise interest rates again soon. But they appeared to be getting used to the idea that inflation is going to stay lower than they had hoped. For years it's come up short of their 2-percent target.
Kristina Hooper, global markets strategist for Invesco, said one reason for that low inflation is continued fallout from the financial crisis a decade ago. In her view, many of the jobs that were lost after the 2008-09 meltdown were replaced by lower-paying ones.
"There are still a good portion of Americans who are making less today than they made before the global financial crisis," she said. "That's playing a role in lower wage growth and low inflation."
The Standard & Poor's 500 index gained 4.60 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,555.24. The Dow Jones industrial average added 42.21 points, or 0.2 percent, to 22,872.89. The Nasdaq composite rose 16.30 points, or 0.2 percent, to 6,603.55. All three indexes finished at all-time highs. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks edged down 1.08 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,506.92.
Hooper said inflation might increase if President Donald Trump and Congress pass a tax cut that encourages businesses to invest more money. She said that businesses and consumers both feel optimistic about the economy, but they're reluctant to spend money because they're not sure what economic policy will look like.
Airlines rose for the second day in a row. Delta Air Lines' profit and revenue were better than analysts anticipated, and the company also issued a strong forecast for the fourth quarter. Delta rose 37 cents to $53.07. It has surged 9 percent since Oct. 3, when it raised its third-quarter projections. JetBlue gained 30 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $20.53 after it gave an update on the revenue it lost following hurricanes Irma and Maria.
Johnson & Johnson led health care companies higher after it asked regulators to approve its drug apalutamide. It's intended for patients with a hard-to-treat form of prostate cancer. Johnson & Johnson stock climbed $2.75, or 2.1 percent, to $136.65.
Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.35 percent from 2.36 percent. That sent affected bank stocks because lower yields mean lower interest rates on loans, and lower profits for banks.
JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup will report their quarterly results Thursday morning as bank earnings get started.
An upset loss by the U.S. men's soccer team dented shares of Twenty-First Century Fox. The team will miss the 2018 World Cup following its loss to Trinidad and Tobago. That could cut into advertising revenue for Fox, which will broadcast the event. The stock fell 66 cents, or 2.5 percent, to $26.11.
Luxury handbag and accessories maker Coach said it will change its name to Tapestry at the end of October. It bought the Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman brands over the last few years and said it wants its name to reflect its growth beyond the iconic Coach brand. The stock lost $1.13, or 2.8 percent, to $38.87.
Sears sagged after the company's former Canadian unit asked a court to allow it to liquidate its 130 remaining stores. Sears Canada said it couldn't find a buyer to allow it to stay in business. Sears Canada was split off from Sears Holdings in 2014, but the U.S. business has also been struggling for years and investors are unsure about its future. On Wednesday the stock lost 46 cents, or 6.9 percent, to $6.24.
Benchmark U.S. crude oil rose 38 cents to $51.30 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, added 33 cents to $56.94 a barrel in London.
Wholesale gasoline picked up 2 cents to $1.61 a gallon. Heating oil gained 2 cents to $1.79 a gallon. Natural gas remained at $2.89 per 1,000 cubic feet.
Gold fell $4.90 to $1,288.90 an ounce. Silver lost 7 cents to $17.13 an ounce. Copper gained 4 cents to $3.10 a pound.
The dollar rose to 112.42 yen from 112.37 yen. The euro rose to $1.1855 from $1.1804.
The German DAX added 0.2 percent and the FTSE 100 in Britain slipped 0.1 percent. France's CAC 40 took a small loss. The Spanish Ibex 35 rose 1.3 percent after the Catalan regional government stopped short of declaring independence. Late Tuesday regional President Carles Puigdemont said Catalonia should hold talks with the Spanish central government after a landslide result in an independence referendum earlier this month.
The Madrid-based government has given few hints it is willing to talk since it does not consider the vote to be valid.
Japan's Nikkei 225 index rose 0.3 percent and closed at another 21-year high. South Korea's Kospi rose 1 percent but the Hang Seng in Hong Kong ended 0.4 percent lower.

Full text: For decades, the global economy has been defined by dissonance. There has been the Japanese recession. The financial crises in the United States and Europe. And drama in emerging markets throughout.
But as central bankers, finance ministers and money managers descend on Washington this week for the fall meetings of the International Monetary Fund, they will confront an unusual reality: global markets and economies rising in unison.
Never mind political turmoil, populist uprisings and threats of nuclear war. From Wall Street to Washington, economists have been upgrading their forecasts for the global economy this year, with the consensus now pointing to an expansion of more than 3 percent -- up noticeably from 2.6 percent in 2016.
Economists from the I.M.F. are likely to follow suit when the fund releases its biannual report on the global economy on Tuesday.
The rosy numbers are noteworthy. But what's more startling is that virtually every major developed and emerging economy is growing simultaneously, the first time this has happened in 10 years.
"In terms of positive cycles, it is difficult to find very many precedents here," said Brian Coulton, the chief economist at Fitch, the debt ratings agency. "It is the strongest growth we have seen since 2010."
In Japan, a reform-minded government and aggressive action by the central bank have pushed growth to 1.5 percent -- up from 0.3 percent three years ago.
In Europe, strong domestic demand in Germany and robust recoveries in countries like Spain, Portugal and Italy are expected to spur 2.2 percent growth in the eurozone. That would be more than double its average annual growth in the previous five years.
Aggressive infrastructure spending by China; bold economic reforms by countries including Brazil, Indonesia and India; and rising commodities prices (helping countries such as Russia) have spurred growth in emerging markets.
And in the United States, despite doubts about President Trump's ability to pass a major tax bill, the economy and financial markets chug along.
In fact, one of the few large economies not following an upward path is Britain, whose pending exit from the European Union is taking a toll. Having grown at an average annual pace of just over 2 percent from 2012 to 2016, the British economy is expanding just 1.5 percent this year.
Still, the good news may result in some backslapping this week for policy makers and regulators more accustomed in recent years to putting out financial fires than basking in improved economic well-being.
"The meetings will celebrate this period of synchronized economic growth and calm financial markets," said Mohamed A. El-Erian, chief economic adviser to the fund giant Allianz.
There are plenty of reasons to hold off on uncorking the Champagne. Wage gains have been slow in coming. And most experts think the current sweet spot of positive growth, low inflation and accommodating central bank policies could be fleeting.
Mr. El-Erian, for example, said he was nervous about several possibilities: that global growth could taper off; that prices of stocks, bonds and other financial assets are unsustainably high; and, most important, that markets might not be prepared when central banks reverse their efforts to stimulate economies by keeping interest rates low and buying huge sums of assets.
But for the time being, investors, economists and policy officials point to a growing quantity of data that highlight the power of this recent burst of economic growth.
Business sentiment in Japan and Europe is at 10-year highs. And last month, manufacturing activity in the United States hit its highest level in 13 years.
A big driver for growth in emerging markets, said Mr. Coulton, the economist at Fitch, has been Chinese imports, which are up more than 10 percent this year. China is the world's largest consumer of raw materials such as oil, steel and copper, and it is increasingly buying them from emerging economies.
Global portfolio managers like Rajiv Jain of GQG Partners, who oversees $9 billion, have been quick to capitalize, snapping up shares of Russian banks and French construction companies.
"The global economy looks pretty darn good," Mr. Jain said.
But with interest rates still historically low, investors have been pushing into even riskier assets, including the bonds of emerging-market economies, to eke out returns.
Some countries are taking advantage of the frenzy by issuing more debt. Argentina recently sold so-called century bonds, which don't come due for 100 years. Jordan and Ukraine issued government bonds that mature in 30 years and 15 years, respectively.
Susan Lund, an expert on global financial trends at the McKinsey Global Institute, said these types of investments from global asset managers tended to be longer term -- and thus less destabilizing -- than the so-called hot money from commercial banks that contributed to recent debt crises in the United States and Europe.
Are things getting too hot?
"We are in a boom today, but we should not forget that the financial system is still relatively unstable," said Jim Reid, a credit strategist at Deutsche Bank.
Mr. Reid, who spices up his market analyses by regaling clients with pop songs on the piano, recently published a detailed study on what he expects will be the causes of the next global financial crisis.
Pick your poison: an abrupt slowdown in China, the rise of populism, debt problems in Japan or an ugly outcome to Britain's move to leave the European Union.
His overriding worry, though, is that investors and policy makers aren't prepared for what will happen when global central banks put a halt to their easy-money policies.
Since the 2008 crisis, Mr. Reid noted, central banks have accumulated more than $14 trillion in assets -- an amount that exceeds the annual output of China by $3 trillion.
What happens when the central banks all start to sell?
"This is unprecedented," Mr. Reid said. "And no one knows what the outcome will be."

Full text: ECONOMY Nobel in Economics to Be Awarded
Nobel season reaches its grand finale on Monday with the announcement of the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, better know as the Nobel in economics. The prize committee in recent years has mostly honored economists for careful work on narrow questions. Macroeconomic theorists, who long dominated the list of recipients, have fallen into disrepute since the 2008 financial crisis, which their theories largely failed to predict or to explain. Last year's winners were Oliver Hart, a professor at Harvard, and Bengt Holmstrom, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, for work that has improved the design of contracts. Binyamin Appelbaum
BANKING
Stress Test Results for Some European Banks
The European Central Bank is expected on Monday to publish the results of its latest stress test to measure the ability of some of the region's lenders to weather another financial shock. As part of this year's exercise, the central bank examined the sensitivity of banks' assets and liabilities to interest rates and of lenders' net interest income to hypothetical rate changes. Chad Bray
ECONOMY
The I.M.F. and World Bank Annual Meetings
Economic power players will converge in Washington beginning Tuesday for the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. Near-term financial forecasts are rosy -- the global economy expanded more than 3 percent this year, a more robust pace than last year, and unusually, most national economies are experiencing growth. Still, the central bankers and finance ministers will be discussing continued underlying economic issues. One discussion, for example, is called, "How Much Inequality Can We Live With?" Zach Wichter
Report on Fed's September Meeting to Be Released
The Federal Reserve at its September meeting capped months of careful preparation by making the widely expected announcement that it would begin to reduce its holdings of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities. The markets barely budged, and an account of the meeting that the Fed plans to publish on Wednesday is unlikely to contain any new details about those plans. The Fed wanted to avoid surprises, and it has succeeded. Attention instead is focused on whether the Fed will raise rates in December, its final meeting of the year, despite the persistent sluggishness of inflation. So far, the Fed has indicated that a rate increase is likely. The meeting account may shed light on any internal misgivings. Binyamin Appelbaum
TRADE
Negotiators to Discuss Changes to Nafta
United States officials will again face off against their Canadian and Mexican counterparts as the fourth round of negotiations over the North American Free Trade Agreement begin on Wednesday in Arlington, Va. The United States has not yet presented specific written proposals for many of President Trump's biggest goals for the trade pact. But officials have said they hope to provide Canada and Mexico with more detail on some of their proposals in the fourth round, as the three countries race toward the ambitious goal of completing the rewrite before the end of the year. Ana Swanson
BANKING
Bank Earnings Season Begins
A spate of banking earnings are coming this week, with Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase reporting on Thursday and Bank of America, PNC and Wells Fargo releasing third-quarter results on Friday. Analysts expect solid but tepid results. Lending has been slow in many areas, including mortgage originations and refinancings. Low volatility has reduced trading profit for many banks, and a drop in mergers and acquisitions has cut into investment banking revenue.
Investors are keeping a close eye on Wells Fargo's management. The bank is still struggling with the aftereffects of the fake accounts scandal that came to light last year, and the company's chief executive, Timothy J. Sloan, faced blistering attacks from lawmakers at a Senate hearing last week. Analysts will be scouring the bank's third-quarter earnings and its executives' guidance for signs of how the turnaround effort is going. Stacy Cowley
ECONOMY
Hurricanes May Skew Inflation Data ...
The Bureau of Labor Statistics on Friday will release its reading of the Consumer Price Index, a crucial measure of inflation, for September. The report will be closely watched by economists looking for clues about when the Federal Reserve will next raise interest rates. The Fed's chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, said last month that she expected the Fed to keep raising rates but cautioned that those plans could change if inflation stays low. September's data could be skewed, however, by hurricanes Harvey and Irma, which drove up prices for fuel and other goods in Florida and Texas. That could lead the Fed to put less significance on Friday's report. Ben Casselman
RETAIL
... And They May Affect Sales Results
On Friday, the Census Bureau will release data on retail sales in September. Analysts expect that the retail sales report will be heavily affected by the major hurricanes that ripped through Florida and drenched parts of Texas. The hurricanes could have a mixed result, though, slowing sales in specialty clothing and nonnecessities. But they may also have bolstered spending on home repair items as homeowners picked up after the storms. Michael Corkery
AUTO INDUSTRY
VW Will Loom Large in Vote in German State
Voters in the German state of Lower Saxony, where the economy revolves around Volkswagen, will elect a new state Parliament next weekend. The outcome could affect Volkswagen management because the state owns a 20 percent stake and has two seats on the company's 20-person supervisory board. The Christian Democrats, who are trying to unseat the Social Democrats, have said they will give their places on the board to business professionals rather than politicians, as has been the case. Poor governance at Volkswagen is viewed as contributing to an emissions scandal that threatens local jobs. Polls show the two main parties neck and neck. Jack Ewing

Full text: LILLESTROM, Norway -- In the three-plus decades since Ola Karlsson began painting houses and offices for a living, he has seen oil wealth transform the Norwegian economy. He has participated in a construction boom that has refashioned Oslo, the capital. He has watched the rent climb at his apartment in the center of the city. What he has not seen in many years is a pay raise, not even as Norway's unemployment rate has remained below 5 percent, signaling that working hands are in short supply.
"The salary has been at the same level," Mr. Karlsson, 49, said as he took a break from painting an office complex in this Oslo suburb. "I haven't seen my pay go up in five years."
His lament resonates far beyond Nordic shores. In many major countries, including the United States, Britain and Japan, labor markets are exceedingly tight, with jobless rates a fraction of what they were during the crisis of recent years. Yet workers are still waiting for a benefit that traditionally accompanies lower unemployment: fatter paychecks.
Why wages are not rising faster amounts to a central economic puzzle.
Some economists argue that the world is still grappling with the hangover from the worst downturn since the Great Depression. Once growth gains momentum, employers will be forced to pay more to fill jobs.
But other economists assert that the weak growth in wages is an indicator of a new economic order in which working people are at the mercy of their employers. Unions have lost clout. Companies are relying on temporary and part-time workers while deploying robots and other forms of automation in ways that allow them to produce more without paying extra to human beings. Globalization has intensified competitive pressures, connecting factories in Asia and Latin America to customers in Europe and North America.
"Generally, people have very little leverage to get a good deal from their bosses, individually and collectively," says Lawrence Mishel, president of the Economic Policy Institute, a labor-oriented research organization in Washington. "People who have a decent job are happy just to hold on to what they have."
The reasons for the stagnation gripping wages vary from country to country, but the trend is broad.
In the United States, the jobless rate fell to 4.2 percent in September, less than half the 10 percent seen during the worst of the Great Recession. Still, for the average American worker, wages had risen by only 2.9 percent over the previous year. That was an improvement compared with recent months, but a decade ago, when the unemployment rate was higher, wages were growing at a rate of better than 4 percent a year.
In Britain, the unemployment rate ticked down to 4.3 percent in August, its lowest level since 1975. Yet wages had grown only 2.1 percent in the past year. That was below the rate of inflation, meaning workers' costs were rising faster than their pay.
In Japan, weak wage growth is both a symptom of an economy dogged by worries, and a force that could keep the future lean, depriving workers of spending power.
In Norway, as in Germany, modest pay raises are a result of coordination between labor unions and employers to keep costs low to bolster industry. That has put pressure on Italy, Spain and other European nations to keep wages low so as not to lose orders.
But the trend also reflects an influx of dubious companies staffed by immigrants who receive wages well below prevailing rates, undermining union power.
That this is happening even in Norway -- whose famed Nordic model places a premium on social harmony -- underscores the global forces that are at work. Jobs that require specialized, advanced skills are growing. So are low-paying, low-skill jobs. Positions in between are under perpetual threat.
"The crisis accelerated the adjustment, the restructuring away from goods producing jobs and more into the service sector," says Stefano Scarpetta, director for employment, labor and social affairs at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris. "Many of those who lost jobs and went back to work landed in jobs that pay less."
Union Power Eroded
In November 2016, a week after Donald J. Trump was elected president on a pledge to bring jobs back to America, the people of Elyria, Ohio -- a city of 54,000 people about 30 miles west of Cleveland -- learned that another local factory was about to close.
The plant, operated by 3M, made raw materials for sponges. Conditions there were influenced by an increasingly rare feature of American life: a union that represented the workers.
The union claimed the closing was a result of production being moved to Mexico. Management said it was merely cutting output as it grappled with a glut coming from Europe. Either way, 150 people would lose their jobs, Larry Noel among them.
Mr. Noel, 46, had begun working at the plant seven years earlier as a general laborer, earning $18 an hour. He had worked his way up to batch maker, mixing the chemicals that congealed into sponge material, a job that paid $25.47 an hour.
Now, he would have to start over. The unemployment rate in the Cleveland area was then down to 5.6 percent. Yet most of the jobs that would suit Mr. Noel paid less than $13 dollars an hour.
"These companies know," he said. "They know you need a job, and you've got to take it."
In the end, he found a job that paid only slightly less than his previous position. His new factory was a nonunion shop.
"A lot of us wish it were union," he said, "because we'd have better wages."
Last year, only 10.7 percent of American workers were represented by a union, down from 20.1 percent in 1983, according to Labor Department data. Many economists see the decline as a key to why employers can pay lower wages.
In 1972, so-called production and nonsupervisory workers -- some 80 percent of the American work force -- brought home average wages equivalent to $738.86 a week in today's dollars, after adjusting for inflation, according to an Economic Policy Institute analysis of federal data. Last year, the average worker brought home $723.67 a week.
In short, 44 years had passed with the typical American worker absorbing a roughly 2 percent pay cut.
The streets of Elyria attested to the consequences of this long decline in earning power.
"There's some bail bondsmen, some insurance companies and me," said Don Panik, who opened his gold and silver trading shop in 1982 after he was laid off as an autoworker at a local General Motors plant.
Down the block, a man with a towel slung over bare shoulders panhandled in front of a strip club, underneath a hand-lettered sign that said "Dancers Wanted." A tattoo parlor was open for business, near a boarded-up law office.
One storefront was full of activity -- Adecco, the staffing company. A sign beckoned job applicants: "General Laborers. No Experience Necessary. $10/hour."
Lyndsey Martin had reached the point where the proposition had appeal.
Until three years ago, Ms. Martin worked at Janesville Acoustics, a factory midway between Cleveland and Toledo. The plant made insulation and carpets for cars. She put products into boxes, earning $14 an hour.
That, combined with what her husband, Casey, earned at the plant, was enough to allow them to rent a house in the town of Wakeman, where their front porch looked out on a leafy street.
Then, in summer 2013, word spread that the plant was shutting down, putting 300 people out of work.
Ms. Martin took 18 months off to care for her children. In early 2015, she began to look for work, scouring the web for factory jobs. Most required associate's degrees. The vast majority were temporary.
She took a job at a gas station, ringing up purchases of fuel, soda and fried chicken for $9 an hour, less than two-thirds of what she had previously earned.
"It almost feels degrading," she said.
Her hours fluctuated. Some weeks she worked 35; most weeks, 24.
A competitor to Ms. Martin's former employer has set up a factory directly opposite the plant where she used to work. The company hired 150 people, but not her. She said she had heard the jobs paid three to four dollars less per hour than she used to make.
Ms. Martin recently took a new job at a beer and wine warehouse. It also paid $9 an hour, but with the potential for a $1 raise in 90 days. In a life of downgraded expectations, that registered as progress.
Fear Factor
Conventional economics would suggest that this is an excellent time for Kuniko Sonoyama to command a substantial pay increase.
For the past 10 years, she has worked in Tokyo, inspecting televisions, cameras and other gear for major electronics companies.
After decades of decline and stagnation, the Japanese economy has expanded for six straight quarters. Corporate profits are at record highs. And Japan's population is declining, a result of immigration restrictions and low birthrates. Unemployment is just 2.8 percent, the lowest level in 22 years.
Yet, Ms. Sonoyama, like growing numbers of Japanese workers, is employed through a temporary staffing agency. She has received only one raise -- two years ago, when she took on a difficult assignment.
"I'm always wondering if it's O.K. that I never make more money," Ms. Sonoyama, 36, said. "I'm anxious about the future."
That concern runs the risk of becoming self-fulfilling, for Japan as a whole. Average wages in the country rose by only 0.7 percent last year, after adjusting for the costs of living.
The government has pressed companies to pay higher wages, cognizant that too much economic anxiety translates into a deficit of consumer spending, limiting paychecks for all.
But companies have mostly sat on their increased profits rather than share them with employees. Many are reluctant to take on extra costs out of a fear that the good times will not last.
It is a fear born of experience. Ever since Japan's monumental real estate investment bubble burst in the early 1990s, the country has grappled with a pernicious residue of that era: so-called deflation, or falling prices.
Declining prices have limited businesses' incentive to expand and hire. What hiring companies do increasingly involves employment agencies that on average pay two-thirds of equivalent full-time work.
Today, almost half of Japanese workers under 25 are in part-time or temporary positions, up from 20 percent in 1990. And women, who typically earn 30 percent less than men, have filled a disproportionate number of jobs.
Years of corporate cost-cutting has weakened Japan's unions, which tend to prioritize job security over pay.
The recent uptick in wages, although modest, has raised hopes of increased spending that would embolden businesses to raise pay and to upgrade temporary workers to full-time employees.
Until that happens, workers will probably remain hunkered down, reluctant to spend.
"I have enough to live on now," Ms. Sonoyama said, "but I worry about old age."
Global Threats
No one is supposed to worry in Norway.
The Nordic model has been meticulously engineered to provide universal living standards that are bountiful by global norms.
Workers enjoy five weeks of paid vacation a year. Everyone receives health care under a government-furnished program. Universities are free. When babies arrive, parents divvy up a year of shared maternity and paternity leave.
All of this is affirmed by a deep social consensus and underwritten by stupendous oil wealth.
Yet even in Norway, global forces are exposing growing numbers of workers to new forms of competition that limit pay. Immigrants from Eastern Europe are taking jobs. Temporary positions are increasing.
In theory, Norwegian workers are insulated from such forces. Under Norway's elaborate system of wage negotiation, unions, which represent more than half of the country's work force, negotiate with employers' associations to hash out a general tariff to cover pay across industries. As companies become more productive and profitable, workers capture a proportionate share of the spoils.
Employers are supposed to pay temporary workers at the same scale as their permanent employees. In reality, fledgling companies have captured slices of the construction industry, employing Eastern Europeans at sharply lower wages. Some firms pay temporary workers standard wages but then have them work overtime without extra compensation. Unions complain that enforcement patchy.
"Both the Norwegian employer and the Polish worker would rather have low paid jobs," said Jan-Erik Stostad, general secretary of Samak, an association of national unions and social democratic political parties. "They have a common interest in trying to circumvent the regulations."
Union leaders, aware that companies must cut expenses or risk losing work, have reluctantly signed off on employers hiring growing numbers of temporary workers who can be dismissed with little cost or fuss.
"Shop stewards are hard pressed in the competition, and they say, 'If we don't use them then the other companies will win the contracts," said Peter Vellesen, head of Oslo Bygningsarbeiderforening, a union that represents bricklayers, construction workers and painters. "If the company loses the competition, he will lose his work."
Last year, companies from Spain and Italy won many of the contracts to build tunnels south of Oslo, bringing in lower-wage workers from those countries.
Mr. Vellesen's union has been organizing immigrants, and Eastern Europeans now comprise one-third of its roughly 1,700 members. But the trends can be seen in paychecks.
From 2003 to 2012, Norwegian construction workers saw smaller wage increases than the national average in every year except two, according to an analysis of government data by Roger Bjornstad, chief economist at the Norwegian Federation of Trade Unions.
When Mr. Karlsson, the painter, came to Norway from his native Sweden in the mid-1990s, virtually everyone in the trade was a full-time worker. Recently, while painting the offices of a government ministry, he encountered Albanian workers. He was making about 180 kroner per hour, or about $23, under his union scale. The Albanians told him they were being paid barely a third of that.
"The boss could call them, and 20 guys would be standing outside ready to work," Mr. Karlsson said. "They work extra hours without overtime. They work weekends. They have no vacations. It's hard for a company that's running a legitimate business to compete."
He emphasized that he favored open borders. "I have no problem with Eastern Europeans coming," he said. "But they should have the same rights as the rest of us, so all of us can compete on equal terms."
Even in specialized, higher-paying industries, Norwegian wage increases have slowed, as unions and employers cooperate toward improving the fortunes of their companies.
That is a pronounced contrast from past decades, when Norway tallied up the profits from oil exports while handing out wage raises that reached 6 percent a year.
As the global financial crisis unfolded in 2008, sending a potent shock through Europe, Norway's high wages left businesses in the country facing a competitive disadvantage. That was especially true as mass unemployment tore across Italy, Portugal and Spain, depressing wages across the continent. And especially as German labor unions assented to low pay to maintain the country's export dominance.
Starting in mid-2014, a precipitous descent in global oil prices ravaged Norway's energy industry and the country's broader manufacturing trades. That year, Norwegian wages increased by only 1 percent after accounting for inflation, and by only a half percent the next year. In 2016, wages declined in real terms by more than 1 percent.
Peder Hansen did not relish the idea of a smaller pay raise, but neither was he terribly bothered.
Mr. Hansen works at a nickel refinery in Kristiansand, a city tucked into the nooks and crannies along Norway's southern coast. His plant is part of Glencore, the mammoth Anglo-Swiss mining firm. He sits at a computer terminal, controlling machinery.
Much of what the refinery produces is destined for factories in Japan that use the nickel to make cars and electronics. Lately, nickel prices have been weak, limiting revenue. This year, Mr. Hansen's union accepted an increase of about 2.5 percent -- a tad above inflation.
"If they were to increase our wages too much, the company would lose customers," Mr. Hansen says. "It's as simple as that."
He exudes faith that his company's fortunes will be shared with him, because he has lived it. At 24, he earns 630,000 kroner a year, with overtime, or more than $80,000. He owns a two-story house in Kristiansand, and he has two cars, an Audi and an electric Volkswagen. The lives of company executives seem not far removed from his own.
"The C.E.O. of the plant is a humble person," he said. "You can say 'Hi."'
But for some workers, the plunge in oil prices has tested faith in the Norwegian bargain.
In Arendal, a coastal town of wooden houses clustered around a harbor, Bandak, a local employer, succumbed to the crisis. The company made equipment connecting oil pipelines. As orders grew scarce in late 2014, a series of layoffs commenced. Workers ultimately agreed to a 5 percent pay cut to spare their jobs.
"We wanted to keep all of our employees, so we stuck together," said Hanne Mogster, the former human resources director. "There was a lot of trust."
But the company soon descended into bankruptcy. And that was that for the 75 remaining workers.
Per Harald Torjussen, who worked on Bandak's assembly line, managed to find a job at a nearby factory at slightly better pay.
Still, his confidence has been shaken.
"It feels a lot less secure," Mr. Torjussen says. "We may be approaching what it's like in the U.S. and the U.K."

Full text: NAIROBI, Kenya -- Sudan Airways regularly ranks among the worst airlines in the world. The national carrier has only one working plane, and it has suffered so many deadly accidents in recent years that passengers have acquired the habit of praying before takeoff. The troubled airline, or rather, airplane, epitomizes some of the effects that two decades of American sanctions have had on Sudan, a predominantly Arab country on the edge of sub-Saharan Africa.
Since the 1990s, the United States has imposed a series of economic sanctions on Sudan over its government's support of terrorist groups, including Al Qaeda, turning the country into a pariah state.
Most Western countries have shunned Sudan, making it hard for companies like Sudan Airways to procure parts or buy new planes from Boeing or Airbus. The airline's general manager once described the sanctions as "hell."
The country's economic isolation is about to end.
The Trump administration announced on Friday that it would formally lift a host of sanctions, including a trade embargo, saying the Sudanese government had made progress on a number of issues, like cooperating on counterterrorism efforts and making modest improvements.
The State Department also said the government has stopped attacking civilians and has improved in allowing humanitarian aid to reach troubled regions like Darfur, the scene of a genocide starting in 2003, in which the government was accused of massacring hundreds of thousands of people.
Washington said the country was also curbing its destabilizing activities in neighboring South Sudan, which split off as an independent nation in 2011.
The sanctions, which had been under suspension, will be lifted permanently as of Thursday.
In exchange for ending sanctions, the United States said it had secured a commitment from Sudan that it would not engage in weapons trade from North Korea.
The United States is still keeping Sudan on its list of terrorism sponsors, which means it will not be granted debt relief, a major drag on the economy.
The Trump administration decision has provoked a backlash from some human rights groups that say Sudan has not done enough to improve its rights record.
Amnesty International accused Sudanese government forces of using chemical weapons against civilians in Darfur last year, and there are ongoing skirmishes in the region. President Omar Hassan al-Bashir, who came to power 27 years ago, is sought by the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity and war crimes committed in Darfur.
Supporters of the American decision say the sanctions have done little to encourage reforms and instead pushed Sudan into the arms of United States trade rivals like China and the Gulf States.
Removing sanctions is an admission by the United States that they "are no longer appropriate and effective," said Magnus Taylor, a Sudan analyst at the International Crisis Group.
"It is appropriate now to offer Sudan incentives and the beginning of a way back to a kind of international order from which it was thoroughly expelled," Mr. Taylor added. "They had made enough progress to make the first rung of the ladder, and we need to keep pushing them to climb."
Sudan is now expected to become at least moderately more attractive to Western investors, particularly companies eager to enter a region where countries like China, Malaysia and India are already present.
The lifting of the trade embargo "will be very positive for Bashir," said Alex Vines, head of the Africa program at Chatham House, a research organization in London. "This has long been anticipated and it shows how Bashir has been remodeling himself through international partnerships."
State Department officials say the removal of sanctions would unfreeze government assets and benefit aviation and energy businesses.
Sudan's economy is mired in debt -- foreign creditors are owed $51 billion, or 60 percent of its gross domestic product -- and it suffers from high inflation and low productivity. The economy was dealt a severe blow after the oil-rich south tore itself away.
The sanctions placed restrictions on international financial transactions, making it difficult to acquire technology and equipment. Hundreds of factories were shut down because of a lack of parts and trade barriers.
Since the lifting of sanctions was announced, "there's been a lot of excitement among the Sudanese middle classes, even for things like getting a cinema," Mr. Taylor said.
Remittances from abroad will be transferred more easily, which will help lift domestic consumption and the economy.
"It won't be transformational," said Mr. Taylor, who called it "a first step in a normalizing process."
He added: "It's taking their place in the world as an ordinary, responsible state."

Storms Lead Jobs to Fall; First Decline In 7 Years

Full text: Staggering from the impact of hurricanes that walloped Texas, Florida and neighboring states, the economy lost 33,000 jobs in September, the first monthly decline in employment in seven years, the government reported on Friday. But economists discounted the discouraging report, describing it as a blip in a job market that was fundamentally strong.
Some of the good news released by the Labor Department -- a drop in the jobless rate to 4.2 percent and a year-over-year gain in wage growth of 2.9 percent -- may also have been skewed by weather disruptions.
"The numbers were certainly blown around a lot by the storms," said Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist for Northern Trust. For that reason, he said, the Federal Reserve, which has been scrutinizing the employment report for signs of inflation, will probably look past this report. "As winds calm," he said, "my guess is employment figures will stabilize."
That pattern held true for Bruce Gropper, who runs Right at Home, a home-care franchise in Palm Beach, Fla.
"We put our hiring on hold" because of the weather, Mr. Gropper said, adding that many of the 50 to 75 caregivers who work for him and would typically have been in the field were unable or unavailable to work during a two-week period. "Now, things are back to normal."
It was the same in Texas. "There's a lot of manufacturing jobs in Beaumont, Corpus Christi, Houston, all of which suffered damage," noted Ray Perryman, president of the Perryman Group, an economic research and analysis firm based in Waco, Tex. "Some of these plants were shut down for an extended period of time, and that would have gotten into the September survey."
One upside may be a surge in hiring in subsequent months. Using Hurricane Katrina in August 2005 as a benchmark, Jim O'Sullivan, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics, said he expected payrolls to bounce back by the end of the year.
"There's no question there were huge hurricane effects," he said. Food and drinking establishments alone lost 105,000 jobs last month, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the number of people who said they were not working because of bad weather jumped by 1.5 million.
Mr. O'Sullivan and several economists agreed that the labor market was still pushing ahead -- no matter how unevenly -- in what is now the ninth year of an economic expansion. "The other data we've been seeing this week don't show any signs of a weaker trend," Mr. O'Sullivan said. "If you take out Texas and Florida, there's been no increase in jobless claims over the past five weeks."
The stock market's reaction to the news was mildly negative. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined slightly from record levels after eight straight days of gains.
President Trump called attention this week to the economy's successes, writing on Twitter on Thursday, "Stock Market hits an ALL-TIME high! Unemployment lowest in 16 years!" Last week, Mr. Trump said that the Republicans' proposed tax cuts would provide further "rocket fuel for our economy."
Many workers have been waiting to see concrete evidence of economic progress in their paychecks. Although the Census Bureau last month reported a jump in annual incomes across a wide spectrum, households with incomes below the median remain worse off than they were in 2000.
The hefty growth in average wages reported on Friday was probably exaggerated, because many low-wage workers were temporarily displaced by the storms, bumping up the overall average.
At least a portion of the 0.5 percent average hourly wage growth last month, though, is likely to stick. There is plenty of evidence that broad swaths of the labor market are tightening. Target said last month that it would increase its base hourly pay by $1, to $11 -- higher than or equal to the minimum wage in every state.
Amy Glaser, senior vice president of Adecco Staffing, said that employers she worked with were raising wages and reaching into less-common pools of potential employees like retirees, stay-at-home moms and people with disabilities.
Ms. Glaser said she expected wages to rise further, saying some of her clients were thinking about increasing hourly wages as much as 20 to 40 percent during the peak holiday season and early next year. Employers are also pushing to retain the workers they have -- for example, by offering more bonuses for e-commerce and other seasonal workers who stay through the holidays.
Some businesses are trying to generate and educate their work forces by offering more paid internships and apprenticeships. Others are shortening the interview cycle to improve their chances. "There is a need for speed," Ms. Glaser said. "Whoever gets to a candidate first is well positioned."
Radial, the second-largest direct-to-consumer e-commerce company behind Amazon, is hiring 27,000 people to work in its 25 warehouses around the country through mid-January. Even as brick-and-mortar retail is suffering significant losses, e-commerce continues to thrive.
"We're hiring 35 percent, or 7,000, more people than we did last year," said Stefan Weitz, Radial's executive vice president for technology services. "It's very competitive. A lot of logistics companies have operations in similar areas because of the proximity to air and ground transport."
At the upper end of the labor market, the competition for highly skilled workers is intense. Bryan Leach, founder of Ibotta, a Denver company offering a mobile shopping app, said he had hired more than 100 people this year, including engineers, product managers and data scientists, mostly at six-figure salaries.
"We are hiring national search firms to shop for talent in the coasts," in addition to seven in-house recruiters, Mr. Leach said. The company has also helped sponsor billboards in San Francisco promoting the benefits of living in Denver and is offering $1,000 apiece to employees who refer friends who are hired.
Despite the scramble for workers, the labor market has stubborn weak spots. Many of the jobs available, like the seasonal positions at Radial, are at the lower end of the pay scale and do not offer long-term stability.
For some workers, such jobs have limited appeal. The labor force participation rate peaked its head above 63 percent in September, but many workers remain on the sidelines.
Revised hiring figures for July and August showed that a total of 38,000 fewer jobs were created in those two months than previously reported, bringing the monthly average gain in 2017 -- excluding September -- to 170,000. August's figures will be revised one more time, while September's will be revised twice over the next two months. State-by-state tallies for September are not yet available.
(Although Hurricane Maria also devastated Puerto Rico in September, the survey of employers that the Bureau of Labor Statistics uses to calculate monthly payroll gains does not include the island.)
The Katrina experience showed that hiring can rebound quickly after a disaster, as damaged communities clean up and rebuild. Employment gains averaged 249,000 in the six months before the storm. After New Orleans found itself underwater, gains averaged 76,000 over the next couple of months before soaring to 341,000 in November 2005.
While the recovery from the latest storms takes shape, businesses and workers are still counting their losses. Brian Petranick, Right at Home's president and chief executive, said Palm Beach was not the only community where franchises were unable to connect workers and clients. He estimated hurricane-related losses to the company would end up at $13 million to $15 million. "During big storms, we see a loss of hours and services," he said. "That means caregivers are losing the opportunity to work and make money."

Full text: Stocks in the United States faded a bit from their record highs on Friday after telecom and energy stocks sank. The loss for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was small, but it was the first in nearly two weeks. Much of the day's action was centered on the government's jobs report, usually the most anticipated economic data of each month, but it was a muddled one.
Economists cautioned not to read too much into the hiring numbers, which were far weaker than expected, because they were distorted by hurricanes that damaged businesses from Texas to Florida. Investors focused instead on a stronger-than-expected rise in workers' wages, which helped push Treasury yields higher.
The S.&P. 500 fell 2.74 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,549.33. The loss meant the end of the longest winning streak for the index in four years. Roughly nine stocks fell for every five that rose on the New York Stock Exchange.
The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 1.72, or less than 0.1 percent, to 22,773.67. The Nasdaq added 4.82, or 0.1 percent, to 6,590.18. All three indexes had closed at records on Thursday.
The government's jobs report showed that employers cut more jobs last month than they added, the first time that has happened in seven years. Hurricanes Harvey and Irma shut down thousands of businesses, and drops in employment at restaurants and bars were a big driver of last month's decline.
Many investors saw September's job losses as an aberration. Other economic data have been more encouraging, including strong reports on the nation's manufacturing and services sectors earlier this week.
Friday's jobs report also contained signs of strength. Average hourly wages jumped 2.9 percent in September from a year earlier, more than expected. Some of that may be because of how many lower-wage jobs were lost following the hurricanes, but the government also revised up its figure for wage growth in August.
"The previous month's revision, that probably has the most information" of all the data points in the government's jobs report, said Jon Adams, senior investment strategist at BMO Global Asset Management. "From the Fed's perspective, this doesn't change anything in terms of overall policy, but it makes them a little more worried about inflation."
Early gains on the yield of the 10-year Treasury faded later in the day, which traders said may have been because of worries about tensions with North Korea. A Russian lawmaker said that North Korea is preparing to test-fire a long-range missile soon.
By Friday evening, the 10-year yield sat at 2.36 percent.
Telecom stocks in the S.&P. 500 fell 2 percent, the largest drop among the 11 sectors that make up the index.
Energy stocks were also among the market's weakest after the price of benchmark United States crude sank $1.50, or 3 percent, to $49.29 per barrel. It is the fourth drop for oil in the last five days.
In the currency market, the dollar slipped to 112.65 Japanese yen from 112.82 yen late Thursday. The euro rose to $1.1731 from $1.1704, and the British pound fell to $1.3063 from $1.3115.
Gold rose $1.70 to settle at $1,271.60 per ounce.

Full text: By all accounts, Rex Tillerson has demoralized and degraded the State Department to the point of uselessness. Tom Price did much the same to Health and Human Services before jetting off. Scott Pruitt has moved rapidly to eliminate the "protection" aspect of the Environmental Protection Agency. And similar stories are unfolding throughout the executive branch. Donald Trump has, in short, been like a Category 5 hurricane sweeping through the U.S. government, leaving devastation in his wake. And one question I don't see being asked often enough is, will the same thing happen to the Federal Reserve? And if it does, how disastrous will that end up being for the world economy?
The Fed, which sets monetary policy, is by far our most important economic agency; its chairwoman (or chairman) is arguably the most powerful economic official in the world, more than the president himself. Its institutional status is peculiar: It isn't exactly part of the executive branch, but it isn't exactly independent, either. Its board members are appointed by the president subject to congressional approval, but have traditionally been technocrats expected to distance themselves from partisan politics.
That is, however, a norm rather than a legal requirement. And we know what tends to happen to norms in the Trump era.
For more than a decade the Fed chair has been a distinguished academic economist -- first Ben Bernanke, then Janet Yellen. You might wonder how such people, who have never been in the business world, who have never met a payroll, would deal with real-world economic problems; the answer, in both cases: superbly.
In particular, both Bernanke and Yellen responded effectively to a once-in-three-generations economic crisis despite constant heckling from back-seat drivers in Congress and on the political right in general. And their intellectual and moral courage has been completely vindicated by events.
Given this track record, you might expect to see either Yellen reappointed or an equally qualified technocrat take her place. But remember, we're living in the age of Trump, which means that we should actually expect the worst.
It seems safe to assume that Trump himself understands nothing about monetary policy. True, he's pronounced on the subject fairly often, but not in any coherent way. One day he praises low interest rates for boosting the economy; the next he denounces them for hurting the incomes of the middle class. So trying to guess his Fed choice from his policy views is a mug's game.
What he's more likely to do is what he's done with many other appointments: defer to congressional Republican leaders -- leaders who, on matters monetary, have been wrong about everything.
When the financial crisis struck in 2008, it was essential that the Fed engage in aggressive monetary expansion -- loosely speaking, print lots of money. There are circumstances in which that kind of action would be inflationary, but economists (like Bernanke and, well, yours truly) who had studied the subject understood that this wasn't one of those times. Indeed, inflation stayed quiescent even as the Fed quadrupled the monetary base.
But congressional leaders fought these necessary measures every step of the way. Most notably, Paul Ryan, who gets his ideas about monetary policy from Ayn Rand novels, berated Bernanke, claiming that his policies would debase the dollar and lead to runaway inflation.
Writing with John Taylor, one of the people whose name is being floated as a possible Fed chairman, Ryan went so far as to suggest that the Fed's policies were part of a politically motivated attempt to bail out President Obama's fiscal policies. And so on.
And it goes more or less without saying that none of the people who kept warning that the Fed would cause terrible inflation have admitted having been wrong, or learned anything from the experience.
What all this means is that if congressional Republicans play a large role in selecting the next Fed chair, they'll insist that it be someone who has been wrong about everything for the past decade.
Kevin Warsh, a former Fed governor widely considered a favorite for the job, certainly fits the bill. He warned about inflation in the midst of global economic collapse; he argued vigorously against doing anything, monetary or other, to fight 10 percent unemployment; he warned that the United States was about to turn into Greece, Greece I tell you. And he has shown no hint of being chastened by the failure of events to play out the way he expected.
Now, I don't know who Trump will actually pick to head the Federal Reserve. It might actually end up being someone smart, knowledgeable and honest. Hey, there's a first time for everything.
But surely it's possible, even probable, that the Federal Reserve, like other government agencies, is about to get Trumpified, that one of American policy's last remaining havens of competence and expertise will soon share in the general degradation. And won't that be fun when the next crisis hits?

A Lasting Scar of Recession: 1.5 Million Workers Vanish

Full text: The American economy has created nearly 16 million new jobs in the eight years since the end of the Great Recession. The unemployment rate, which hit 10 percent in 2009, has fallen below 5 percent. And wages, at long last, are rising. Yet for some workers, the wounds of the recession have not fully healed. The key issue facing policy makers now is whether the scars will prove enduring.
In August, 78.4 percent of Americans in their prime working years -- typically defined as ages 25 to 54 -- had jobs, down 1.3 percentage points from when the recession began. That small-sounding change masks a vast human toll: the disappearance of more than 1.5 million workers from the economy. Research has found that many fell into drug addiction and poverty.
The question is how a recovery in progress for eight years could have left so many people on the sidelines. Is it a reflection of lingering economic weakness -- which traditional stimulus policies might yet address -- or long-term forces such as automation, globalization and changing demographics?
Recent evidence suggests that the recession's impact is still echoing through the work force. In a newly published working paper, Danny Yagan, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, used anonymous tax records to trace more than a million individual workers through the recession and its aftermath. He found that in the places that had been hit the hardest, the effects have lingered -- thousands of workers who lost their jobs struggled to find work and ultimately stopped looking. Many, according to Mr. Yagan's data, still haven't found it.
"The signals say the recession is over, but employment's not back to normal," Mr. Yagan said. "Recession effects aren't supposed to last this long."
Indeed, traditional economic theory has held that the damage from recessions is usually short-lived. For most of the 20th century, the nation bounced back quickly from downturns, with displaced workers quickly finding new jobs. Some economists even hailed recessions for their "cleansing" effects, purging unproductive companies in much the same way that forest fires burn up dead wood and release seeds that provide new growth.
More recently, however, that pattern seems to have changed. The United States recovered slowly from the relatively mild recession that followed the bursting of the dot-com bubble, and the current recovery has been anemic by many measures. Economic growth has averaged just 2.2 percent per year since the recession ended, half the rate that followed the recession of the early 1980s. Some places have done even worse: A recent report from the Economic Innovation Group, a nonprofit research and advocacy organization, identified large parts of the country, including cities like Cleveland and Memphis, that have experienced essentially no recovery at all.
"We seem to have had a series of shocks and recessions where things haven't quite come back," said Lawrence F. Katz, a Harvard economist.
For Mr. Yagan and many liberal economists, the solution to the problem is more and faster economic growth: If a weak economy is the disease, then a strong economy is the cure. That would argue for continued stimulus efforts such as low interest rates or perhaps increased spending on infrastructure. They point to the late 1990s as a period when low unemployment and strong demand for workers raised wages and attracted more people to the labor market.
But others are skeptical that a recovery, however strong, could draw back workers who have drifted so far from the labor market.
Another Harvard economist, the former Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers, said Mr. Yagan's research and other evidence made it "difficult to escape the conclusion" that recessions now do permanent -- or at least "quasi-permanent" -- damage to the economy. That is, the recession may have been what pushed people out of the labor force, but recovery alone may not be enough to bring them back.
"There are a bunch of people who were knocked out by the recession who aren't coming back even in the places where unemployment has fallen," Mr. Summers said, although he said he believed there is room for further improvement in the labor market.
It is not clear what has been preventing workers from returning to work as the economy has improved. Recent research from the Princeton economist Alan B. Krueger has linked the decline in employment among men, in particular, to opioid abuse, a problem unlikely to go away simply because more jobs become available. Mr. Krueger found that nearly half of the working-age men who are not in the labor force take pain medication daily; many employers have recently complained that they are having trouble finding workers who can pass a drug test.
Other factors that could be keeping people out of the job market are also being examined. In a widely discussed paper earlier this year, for example, economists at the University of Chicago and other schools argued that some young men are opting out of the labor force to play video games. (Other economists are skeptical.) Some research has pointed a finger at the federal disability system: Nearly two million more Americans are receiving federal disability payments than when the recession began in 2007, an increase that some economists argue is a reflection of the benefits' use as an alternative to work. Some research, however, has concluded that the increase in disability claimants is due mostly to an aging population and is, in any case, a small piece of the overall decline in employment.
Deeper changes in the structure of the American economy could also be playing a part. A variety of evidence, including declining rates of entrepreneurship and falling job turnover, suggests the nation's economy has become less dynamic and flexible since 2000, which could have made it harder for workers and companies alike to adapt following the shock of a recession.
And the recession may have accelerated trends that were already underway: Research from Lisa B. Kahn, a Yale economist, and a co-author has found that companies had, in effect, taken advantage of the recession to replace workers with machines. That was particularly damaging for men without a college degree -- a group that was already struggling before the recession and that has been especially slow to recover from it.
"We were on a kind of trend where that group of people was going to find it harder and harder to find productive outlets in the labor market, and the recession kind of accelerated that," Ms. Kahn said. Had the change happened more gradually, Ms. Kahn added, workers might have had a chance to adapt and learn new skills; instead, the recession left millions of them jobless in an environment where there was little demand for their labor.
Work like that of Ms. Kahn and Mr. Krueger suggests that what begins as a cyclical recession-driven problem can harden into a permanent structural issue. That could carry a lesson for policy makers: If the United States no longer recovers as quickly from recessions as it once did, and if those slow recoveries can leave permanent scars on workers, then it is all the more important to kick-start the economy before too much damage is done.
Ben S. Bernanke, then the chairman of the Federal Reserve, warned during the recession and the recovery that workers who stayed unemployed too long might drift too far away from the labor market to return. Mr. Yagan's research suggests that efforts by the Fed, Congress and the Obama administration to prevent that had not gone far enough.
Jared Bernstein, a former economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. who is now with the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said Mr. Yagan's research could be read as an indictment of economic policy after the recession. If Congress and the administration had been willing to act more aggressively, they might have avoided some of the long-lasting damage that has been done.
Now, it may be too late for some workers -- but perhaps not for all. The employment rate among working-age men, including among men without a college degree, has been inching back up. Mr. Yagan said that data, along with other evidence such as continued low inflation, is "consistent with these folks being employable rather than being lost forever."
Mr. Bernstein agreed, and said that should encourage the Fed and other policy makers to do all they can to keep the recovery on track.
"I see no reason not to try to claw back whatever we can from these effects," Mr. Bernstein said. "What good reason is there for not trying to draw in any potential labor supply that might be out there?"

As Debt Fear Fades, Risks Remain

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The federal government learned over the last half-century that it could run up a much larger debt than experts had previously considered prudent or even possible. Now, as Republicans push a tax plan that would propel the federal debt to new heights, experts are debating the lessons of that history. Some see evidence that the downside of deficits is greatly overstated; others say the country just hasn't reached the precipice.
Every dollar of federal borrowing clearly imposes real economic costs, starting with the basic obligation to make regular interest payments, including to foreign investors.
But the extent of additional costs is an unresolved question. If deficits are relatively benign, it would strengthen the case for near-term borrowing to increase growth.
Federal borrowing has increased sharply. From the mid-1950s until the global financial crisis in 2008, the debt never exceeded half of the nation's annual economic output. As of June, it stood at around 75 percent of that output. And even without new tax cuts or spending increases, the Congressional Budget Office projects that the debt will reach 106 percent of output over the next two decades, setting a record as an aging population strains federal retirement and health care programs.
The amount owed to investors is $14.4 trillion. That's already a record, but economists prefer to measure the debt in relation to the economy. The United States can afford a larger debt as the economy grows, just as millionaires can afford larger mortgages.
As the federal debt rose in the 1980s, and again in the early 2000s, so did the chorus of dire warnings: Inflation and interest rates would rise, economic growth would falter -- and, at some point, the markets might simply refuse to finance the federal government over concerns it would be unable to pay its bills.
This time around, even those who regard the debt as a real and present danger have become more cautious about the presentation of those arguments. They say policy makers simply can't know when markets might begin to demand higher rates.
"We don't have a measure of how much fiscal space we have, but a good political metric is to see how far we are from a record-high level of debt," said Marc Goldwein of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan group whose name describes its views.
He noted that the debt was on a pace to exceed the high point reached after World War II. "I don't want to be in the business of testing how far we can go," he said.
The problem confronting those who want the government to reduce annual deficits is that the short-term consequences of profligacy have proved to be very modest, while the political benefits are substantial.
"It doesn't take a political scientist to understand that taking stuff away is a lot less popular than giving stuff out," Mr. Goldwein said.
Low interest rates have greatly reduced the government's borrowing costs. Measured as a share of the national economy, the federal debt is about three times as large as in the 1960s, but by the same measure, the interest payments are about the same.
Interest payments are still projected to total $6 trillion over the next decade. And one thing that has changed: 40 percent of the debt is now held by foreign investors.
The impact of federal borrowing on the rest of the economy is harder to assess.
Economists warned for decades that deficits caused inflation and reduced the amount of money available to the private sector, ultimately reducing growth and prosperity.
The years under President Ronald Reagan suggested that those theories needed some work. As federal deficits ballooned, inflation declined -- and all the while the economy grew.
"Reagan proved that deficits don't matter," Vice President Dick Cheney said in 2002, as the George W. Bush administration pursued a similar fiscal policy with roughly the same results.
The International Monetary Fund in 2003 published a study of 107 countries over four decades that found little connection between deficits and inflation in developed nations.
The economist Robert Mundell had predicted all of this in the early 1970s, offering an alternative to the standard theory that came to be known as supply-side economics.
He argued that the government should cut taxes to stimulate the economy, then raise interest rates to attract foreign investment, offsetting the increased federal borrowing.
"Suppose it does mean a budget deficit in the United States," he declared at the 1971 conference where he first presented the proposal. "Who cares?"
When he was asked in the 1970s, Mr. Mundell predicted the money would come from the Saudis. In the 1980s, it came from the Japanese. In the 2000s, it came from the Chinese. The one constant has been a sufficient supply of money.
Other economists still see evidence that government borrowing weighs on the economy by reducing the money available for investment. This "crowding out" reduces the progress of productivity, which in turn suppresses the growth of incomes -- a fairly straight line from more federal debt to less money in the average American wallet.
The Congressional Budget Office estimated in 2014 that each dollar of debt reduces private-sector investment by somewhere between 15 and 50 cents, after accounting for the role of higher rates in encouraging domestic and foreign investment.
As the fear of debt has faded, both parties in recent years have embraced proposals to stimulate the economy at the cost of larger short-term deficits. Democrats have backed increased investment in infrastructure, education and research. Republicans argue that the government should simply leave more money in private hands.
Douglas Elmendorf, who led the Congressional Budget Office from 2009 to 2015, repeatedly predicted then that increased federal borrowing would pinch the economy. He said the failure of those predictions suggested there was room to borrow.
"The economy has recovered and interest rates have not risen, and that has caused a great deal of reflection and analysis," said Mr. Elmendorf, who is now the dean of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. "The widespread conclusion is that interest rates are likely to stay below historical norms for an extended period."
Mr. Elmendorf said the government in the long term still faced a difficult choice of some combination of raising taxes and reducing entitlements. It would be easiest to start soon so those changes can be made gradually. He noted that changes to the Social Security program passed in 1983 are still taking effect 34 years later.
In the short term, he said, the government should focus less on increasing overall economic growth than on improving the prospects of lower-income households.
Daniel Shaviro, a law professor at New York University, wrote a book called "Do Deficits Matter?" in the mid-1990s, back when most people thought the answer was yes. Today, he said, he worries that people are becoming too confident the answer is no.
He said the larger risks were real. If the debt continues to rise, "there's a pretty good chance that something bad is going to happen at some point," Mr. Shaviro said. "And you'd rather turn the wheel slowly and gradually rather than stopping abruptly."

Full text: ACCRA, Ghana -- After finishing high school a decade ago, Daniel Awaitey enrolled in computer courses, dropped out to work in a hotel, then settled into a well-paying job in the booming oil sector here. He has an apartment, a car, a smartphone and a long-distance girlfriend he met on a dating website. So he had reasons and the means to celebrate his 27th birthday in late July. His boss and co-workers joined him for an evening of laughter and selfies, lingering over dinner at his favorite restaurant: KFC.
Mr. Awaitey first learned about the fried chicken chain on Facebook. The "finger lickin' good" slogan caught his attention and it has lived up to expectations. "The food is just ----" he said, raising his fingertips to his mouth and smacking his lips. "When you taste it you feel good."
Ghana, a coastal African country of more than 28 million still etched with pockets of extreme poverty, has enjoyed unprecedented national prosperity in the last decade, buoyed by offshore oil. Though the economy slowed abruptly not long ago, it is rebounding and the signs of new fortune are evident: millions moving to cities for jobs, shopping malls popping up and fast food roaring in to greet people hungry for a contemporary lifestyle.
Chief among the corporate players is KFC, and its parent company, YUM!, which have muscled northward from South Africa -- where KFC has about 850 outlets and a powerful brand name -- throughout sub-Saharan Africa: to Angola, Tanzania, Nigeria, Uganda, Kenya, Ghana and beyond. The company brings the flavors that have made it popular in the West, seasoned with an intangible: the symbolic association of fast food with rich nations.
But KFC's expansion here comes as obesity and related health problems have been surging. Public health officials see fried chicken, french fries and pizza as spurring and intensifying a global obesity epidemic that has hit hard in Ghana -- one of 73 countries where obesity has at least doubled since 1980. In that period, Ghana's obesity rates have surged more than 650 percent, from less than 2 percent of the population to 13.6 percent, according to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, an independent research center at the University of Washington.
The causes of obesity are widely acknowledged as complex -- involving changing lifestyles, genetics, and, in particular, consumption of processed foods high in salt, sugar and fat.
KFC's presence in Ghana so far is relatively modest but rapidly growing, and it underscores the way fast food can shape palates, habits and waistlines.
Research shows that people who eat more fast food are more likely to gain weight and become obese, and nutrition experts here express deep concern at the prospect of an increasingly heavy and diabetic population, without the medical resources to address a looming health crisis that some say could rival AIDS.
"You are what you eat," said Charles Agyemang, a Ghanaian who is now an associate professor at the University of Amsterdam, where he studies obesity and chronic disease. KFC alone, he said, is only one factor in the country's obesity epidemic, but it represents the embrace of western foods. In Ghana, he said, "eating local foods in some places is frowned upon. People see the European type as civilized."
"This is having a major impact on obesity and heart disease."
KFC executives see a major opportunity here to be part of people's regular routines, a goal they are advancing through a creative marketing campaign and use of social media. When asked if it is unhealthy for people to eat fried chicken often, Kimberly Morgan, a KFC spokeswoman in Plano, Texas, said, "At KFC, we're proud of our world famous, freshly in-store prepared fried chicken and believe it can be enjoyed as a part of a balanced diet and healthy lifestyle."
Company representatives said they take health seriously in the region, noting their sponsorship of a youth cricket league in South Africa. The company, they said, has worked to make their menu more diverse and healthier.
"That's why we provide consumers choice," said Andrew Havinga, who runs the supply chain for KFC's Africa division. "We do believe in a healthy, balanced lifestyle."
For now, though, KFC customers in Ghana have fewer healthy options than in Western countries. Grilled chicken, salads and sides like green beans and corn, standard at KFC in the United States, aren't available here. Mr. Havinga said KFC hoped to offer Ghanaians more options eventually. "That's part of our journey," he said.
KFC emphasizes its focus on food sanitation and cleanliness. Ghanaian customers interviewed spoke appreciatively of the tidy containers used for takeout and the hairnets worn by workers.
"We wouldn't go into a market unless we are comfortable that we can deliver the same food safety standards that we deliver around the world and people see that," Greg Creed, the chief executive of YUM!, said in an interview last year on CNN. "They actually trust us that it's so much safer to eat at a KFC in Ghana, than it is to eat obviously, you know, pretty much anywhere else."
Some nutrition experts bristle at the implication.
"To say it's the safest food is a bit like saying my hand grenade is the safest hand grenade," said Mike Gibney, an emeritus professor of food and health at University College Dublin. "Ghanaians would be better off eating less KFC. But that is the way of the world I'm afraid."
In Ghana, a place that suffered severe food shortages as recently as the early 1980s, attempts at curbing obesity have butted up against long held societal views: girth can be a welcome sight here. To many, weight gain is an acceptable side effect of a shift from hunger to joyful consumption.
"People march their sons and daughters to buy KFC and buy pizza and the like to show them what we can afford," said Matilda Laar, who lectures about family and consumer sciences at the University of Ghana. KFC isn't just food, she said. "It's social status."
Mr. Awaitey, who celebrated his 27th birthday at a KFC, was raised eating local dishes like soup and banku, a mix of fermented corn and cassava dough. He has increasingly made KFC part of his routine. Some nights on his way home from work, he turns off a sewer-lined street -- jammed with cars and crisscrossed by men hawking sunglasses and women selling doughnuts from baskets they carry on their heads -- and steps into a world transformed: a tidy, air-conditioned KFC where Bruno Mars blares. He orders dinner with a Coke, sitting in a translucent red plastic chair at a white table beneath giant faux Polaroids of children blowing bubbles in a park and a couple strolling on a beach.
"When I grew up I did not have the benefits I'm enjoying today," Mr. Awaitey said. "This didn't even exist.
'Skin in the Game'
In late July, Ashok Mohinani, whose company owns all the KFC franchises in Ghana, dabbed away a smear on a plate-glass window in the dining room of a KFC on the outskirts of Accra as customers trickled in after the doors opened at 10 a.m. It was the newest KFC in the nation, the 13th so far, and Mr. Mohinani was eager to see how it would be received.
The executive director of Mohinani Group, he came to restaurants late, after years in other industries, notably plastics. In 2011, he saw potential in fast food. Incomes were rising as Ghana's oil business took off and other commodities soared; that year the country achieved "lower middle-income" status, according to the World Bank. Its economy had grown 7 percent a year since 2005.
In Accra, the country's densely populated capital, it was plain that diets were changing. Mr. Mohinani had watched street fare evolve from stews and porridges to fried rice and knockoff Cheetos. Vendors now stocked glass cabinets with fried chicken, which in the past families served only on holidays.
The first fast food restaurants to move in were local chains that served fried chicken and mimicked Western brands. Mr. Mohinani was convinced a foreign chain would succeed.
"The obvious brand," he said, "was KFC."
KFC had established a beachhead in South Africa, opening there in the early 1970s. It is now so popular that its executives say they impress dinner-party guests by name-dropping the company where they work.
In 2012, Mr. Mohinani opened a KFC franchise that included the first drive-through restaurant in the nation. People streamed in on foot, just to check it out.
"It was beautiful," he said.
Now, he said, the goal is to move KFC from a special treat to routine. Toward that end, he has opened restaurants alongside gas stations. "We want this to evolve into the idea of getting it to be a daily brand."
It is a goal pursued by fast food companies around the world. From 2011 to 2016, fast food sales grew 21.5 percent in the United States, according to Euromonitor, a market-research firm, while they swelled 30 percent worldwide. The industry has had remarkable success in finding new mouths to feed, with 254 percent growth in Argentina, 83 percent in Vietnam, 64 percent in Egypt.
From around the globe come snapshots of fast-food's spread. Carl's Jr. opened Cambodia's first drive-through fast-food restaurant in 2016, bringing Phnom Penh staples like the Western Bacon Cheeseburger; McDonald's, with 600 Russian outlets, recently opened in Siberia and the Urals; India, which, according to Euromonitor, saw fast-food sales rise 113.6 between 2011 and 2016, now has more than 1,100 Domino's Pizza outlets and is home to an experiment -- a "Dessert Pizza," topped with brownies, cookies, coconut nougat, cheesecake and fudge sauce.
While McDonald's remains the emblem of fast food worldwide, YUM! is number two and grew 22.9 percent from 2011 to 2016, considerably faster than the burger giant's 12.2 percent growth, according to Euromonitor. YUM!, which includes Taco Bell and Pizza Hut, has nearly 44,000 restaurants worldwide, about 17,000 of them in emerging markets as of 2016, the company said. KFC and its franchisees operate nearly 21,000 KFC restaurants in 129 countries and territories around the globe.
Crucial to its effort, the company said, is finding local franchisees like Mr. Mohinani, who have "skin in the game" as Mr. Creed, the YUM! chief executive, said on CNN. The company can rely on their knowledge of the local market and commitment to the investment.
Also crucial: mixing local culture with flavors company executives repeatedly called "aspirational." In Ghana, KFC's menu includes chicken and fries along with a version of jollof rice, a locally beloved spicy dish made with peppers and onions.
"People come to us for the exotic, international American brand and we don't want to water that down," Mr. Mohinani said. "If we made the menu entirely local we'd lose the aspiration."
Affordability is another key ingredient. For KFC, costs here are hard to contain: the company imports chickens from Brazil, in part because local farms don't yet meet KFC's standards for safety and other issues; stores need generators in case of power outages; clean water is specially pumped in. Affordability got tougher since 2014 as global oil prices sank, straining the Ghanaian economy. Nevertheless, to lure more customers, Mr. Mohinani has cut menu prices -- a risky move that he said has paid off with more repeat and regular visitors.
KFC has also launched a marketing campaign called "Streetwise" -- a series of ads and meals it had introduced in South Africa and elsewhere that are designed to appeal to a first generation of middle-class consumers looking for new experiences. In Ghana, the campaign aims at "hustlers and influencers," as executives called them, who rose from the streets and climbed the social ladder.
New ads debuted in May for the Streetwise 2 -- two pieces of chicken, fries and a Coke -- with the popular local singer Ko-Jo Cue holding a sign that says, "It's thanks to the streets that I became a winner."
"I get a Streetwise 2," it continues, "and fuel my ambition."
Health Consequences
The health effects of fast food are challenging to study, particularly in the United States. That's because burgers, fries, fried chicken, pizzas and milkshakes get served all over the place, not just in traditional fast food joints, making it hard to establish the specific influence of fast food on obesity.
But developing countries are newer to fast food. One large-scale study, done in Singapore as it grew economically and attracted Western fast food chains, offers evidence that the arrival of McDonald's, KFC and Pizza Hut, among others, posed a serious health risk.
The study, funded by the National Institutes of Health and published in 2012 in the journal Circulation, followed tens of thousands of Chinese Singaporeans, ages 45 to 74, from the mid-1990s to 2009. Those who ate Western fast food twice a week or more were 27 percent more likely to get type 2 diabetes, and 56 percent more likely to die from heart disease, than subjects who didn't regularly eat such food. And the more times they ate fast food, the higher the risk of death from heart disease.
Studies like these can be challenging to interpret, nutrition experts said, because people who eat fast food can have poor dietary habits, but this study sought to isolate fast food by factoring out many other issues, like sleep, exercise and even consumption of local fried foods. It also caught Singapore as its economy matured and fast food came to town.
"It's a parable, or microcosm, of what's occurring in other parts of the globe," said Andrew Odegaard, a co-author on the study.
In Ghana, data suggest the changing diet to heavier fare -- including fast food but also processed foods -- has led to soaring health risks.
The death rate associated with high body mass index more than doubled in Ghana from roughly 14 per 100,000 in 1990 to 40 per 100,000, according to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation -- and is fast approaching the global average of 54 deaths per 100,000.
The data also suggest that the changing diet has led to health risks in Ghana that are getting worse at a rate faster than in the United States. From 1990 to 2015, deaths related to high body mass increased 179 percent in Ghana, compared to an increase of 20 percent in the United States.
Further complicating the situation in Ghana, medication for high blood pressure is expensive and patients often ration it to save money. National health insurance lags in its coverage of other diet-related diseases such as diabetes; it doesn't cover devices to monitor blood sugar or some of the medicine to treat the side effects of diabetes.
The nation's health system lacks a sufficient number of specialists, counselors and dietitians, let alone doctors.
Dr. Laar, the lecturer from the University of Ghana, said the lack of proper care meant that some people would live with metabolic syndrome until they dropped.
"It's common that you'll see someone just pass out and die," she said.
One smoldering July day, mourners gathered in Accra to pay tribute to someone who did just that -- Vivian Acheampong, 56, who had collapsed at home while hanging laundry on the clothesline and died two days later in a hospital. They fondly remembered her as they milled around and talked about what they believed had killed her. The doctors had told them one major factor was inattention to her high blood pressure: She hadn't listened to their professional advice to change her eating habits, and she couldn't afford all the medicine prescribed to control her condition. Relatives were convinced that her love for fried, fatty food had led her to become obese and played a role in her death.
"Every time it was oil, oil, oil," said her son, Alfred Osei Tutu.
Under a tent decorated with red and black bunting, her relatives and friends heaped their plates with the very foods they said they had warned her against: fried chicken, fried fish, fried rice and fried okra. These offerings have become common at funerals and represent a clear change in tradition: soup and vegetables were once served to mourners.
Mrs. Acheampong's son said she had only dabbled in fast food and had never eaten at KFC. But she had developed a taste for such fare, usually cooked at home, after she moved from her native village to the capital 15 years ago for a better job. An old photo propped up at the funeral showed her as a slender young woman with hollowed cheeks. In the city, the family's diet shifted from stews and fufu, a starch made with cassava, to fried foods.
She fit squarely in a demographic most affected by rising obesity here: women living in cities. A study published last year in the journal BMC Medicine found that obesity among urban female adults in Ghana was 34 percent, compared to 8.3 percent for women in rural areas; among urban men, the rate in was 7 percent, compared to 1.3 percent in rural areas.
"You have more money, you have more food," her son said matter-of-factly.
Birthdays, Poetry Slams and Takeout
KFC's busiest store in Ghana is its flagship, on Oxford Street in the Osu neighborhood. The nation's first KFC, it's a three-story, glassy corner building on a busy retail strip across from two banks and a jewelry shop.
This summer, it drew from all walks: uniformed kids celebrating the last day of school; students from nearby universities using free Wi-Fi at corner tables; government workers ordering lunch to go; members of an artists' collective meeting over dinner to talk about a poetry slam; a dad treating his teenage son and friends to takeout chicken.
On a weekend, the place turned raucous. A group of women dressed in tight, sparkly gowns guzzled champagne from the bottle one evening around a table littered with french fries, fried chicken and a birthday cake, taking turns smearing frosting across the face of the birthday girl. Children joined their parents, downing Coke and buckets of chicken.
Fariha Yussif brought her boyfriend to the restaurant to celebrate his 24th birthday. They stood in a doorway and took photos as friends popped into the frame.
"I like the lights here," said Ms. Yussif, 21, pointing to the low-hanging red lamps. "I like how they arrange the tables and chairs. It's like I'm in Germany or Canada. Everything is very nice."
In late July, the restaurant was low on chicken, a two-day supply hiccup that dogged all of the country's KFCs. Some customers were outraged, prompting workers to ration supplies. Loretta Anaglate, 21, photographed the chicken in her boxed meal that was supposed to contain two pieces, but was actually only one and a half pieces.
She wasn't holding a grudge. Ms. Anaglate, who has been eating KFC since her 16th birthday, lives in a university dormitory a 10-minute walk from a KFC. She estimates she eats there three times a week.
"It's a lie," her friend, Loretta Adjei, interjected. "She eats here every day."
The two young women -- who favor chicken, soda and a popular milkshake-like drink called Krushers -- love the brand so much they worked for a day last year as "promo girls," handing out fliers for a new KFC.
The company has met the youth market in Ghana where it spends time -- on the internet. KFC has a Facebook page and Twitter feed tailored for Ghana and ran an Instagram-based promotion that placed customers' pictures on chicken buckets. Young people fill the company's Facebook page with their own comments and photos.
There don't seem to be a lot of complaints about a menu with items that, in a single meal, can challenge the daily allowance of salt, fat and sugar. According to KFC's online nutrition calculator for Africa, the lunch box meal alone exceeds the daily recommended levels of salt and sugar, and includes trans fatty acids.
"I don't see it as unhealthy," said Ms. Adjei, "I'm still fit and thin."
Local health experts said most Ghanaians don't pay attention to nutrition data. Indeed, the kind of public and political pressure that has prompted KFC to make other changes in the West has not been felt much here.
The chickens are cooked in hot tubs of palm oil -- a substance the company stopped using in the United States and Britain because, among other reasons, it is high in saturated fats. Customers in most of KFC's African markets must go online to find calorie counts, which are not on menu boards like in the United States. The company says there is neither government nor consumer clamor to add them.
"The consumer mind-set is not asking that question generally," said Doug Smart, managing director of KFC Africa.
Presidential Concern but Little Action
Deep inside the presidential palace in Accra, called Flagstaff House, President Nana Akufo-Addo sat in his softly lit, spacious office, decorated with patterned marble floors and ornate, cream-colored couches. A wide-screen TV was tuned to local news. He has recently shed his sharp suits, favoring comfortable print shirts made in Ghana like the bright orange one with colorful swirls he wore on a recent evening.
In office since January, the president ticked off his achievements: plans to chip away at the nation's debt load, to increase tax revenue, to cut waste, to beat back corruption and to spur the economy. He is in the midst of fulfilling a campaign promise to build a factory in each of the nation's 216 districts. He has begun cracking down on illegal gold mining, which is robbing the country of revenue from one of its key natural resources.
Of course, he said, he's worried about skyrocketing obesity and related diseases. Like many of his countrymen, the round-faced president himself is overweight. He said he's also concerned about the increase in fast food restaurants that fuel the trends but said: "I'm strongly averse to banning things."
It's a quandary faced in numerous nations, from India and Brazil to China and Egypt: how to invite economic growth and move beyond scarcity, support growing populations and urbanization, all without being overtaken by two of modernity's chief markers, processed and fast food. So far, not a single nation has been able to reverse the growth of obesity, and only a handful have succeeded in enforcing marketing reforms to limit consumer exposure.
President Akufo-Addo said he hoped to address the problem by expanding national health insurance. That, though, he said, is "a work in progress," given the expense. So, for now, without specifics, he echoed leaders from other nations (and food companies themselves): "There must be heightened public awareness of what's good and bad in terms of eating habits."
Some activists have tried to prompt more action. Dr. Laar has been pushing for food labels that display nutritional content and restrictions on imports of processed food. And she wants more regulations for fast-food restaurants, "before it gets out of hand."
"We already have a problem," she said, "and now there is an influx of fast food companies trying to penetrate the market. We need to make sure the government is regulating how they're trying to do that."
She added: "We shouldn't underestimate the impact they can have now, and in the future if they spread to rural areas."
She was aghast to learn KFC has plans to open four new restaurants in towns outside the capital in rural areas in the next year.
"We must," she said, "come up with more stringent laws."
The presidential palace is not far from the country's most popular KFC, just a short trip after crossing Liberation Road. The day before the president outlined his priorities, a part-time pastor, Joshua Edwards, stopped at the KFC to buy chicken for five boys living in an orphanage. "It's just a wonderful taste for them," he said.
The pastor's round belly strained his shirt buttons and hung far over the red stool where he waited for his order. "My health is my life, so I have to be cautious about my life," he said. "God needs my body to do things to his glory."
Still, Mr. Edwards said he comes to KFC almost every day, beckoned by a giant red billboard outside the store with a huge photo of crispy fried chicken and shimmering golden fries.
"You become addicted to the spices," he said. "That's why everybody wants to have it."
"They don't force us to eat here," he added, "But it's as if we've become mentally enslaved. It tantalizes us by even saying it, pulling you to where you don't want to be."

Full text: Large technology and health care companies and smaller United States-focused companies rose again on Friday as stocks finished the third quarter at record highs. Stocks were mixed at the start of trading, as they had been the day before. But chip makers and big-name technology companies pulled stocks higher, as they have done all year. Health care companies also did better than the rest of the market. Tyson Foods climbed after it gave strong profit forecasts, and investors cheered strong quarterly results from the home builder KB Home.
The market ended the quarter on a four-day winning streak that began after the Federal Reserve chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, said the central bank planned to continue to raising interest rates.
"It's all about the confidence they have that despite low inflation, it still makes sense to raise interest rates," said Randy Frederick, vice president for trading and derivatives at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. "She's confident in the economy, and the economic backdrop is very solid."
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 9.30 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,519.36. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 23.89 points, or 0.1 percent, to 22,405.09. The Nasdaq composite index jumped 42.51 points, or 0.7 percent, to 6,495.96. The S.&P. 500 and Nasdaq closed at new highs.
The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks added 2.08 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,490.86. It is also at record highs after a big rally this month.
Tyson Foods jumped after the company raised its annual guidance and said profits for its beef business were better than expected. Thanks in part to cost cuts, Tyson also forecast a bigger profit than analysts expected for next year.
Tyson climbed $5, or 7.6 percent, to $70.45. The stock gained more ground on Friday than it had for the rest of this year put together. Its rival Hormel Foods, whose brands include Skippy, rose 43 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $32.14.
Technology companies rose further. The S.&P. 500 technology index has climbed 26 percent in 2017, while the S.&P. 500 is up 11.5 percent.
Facebook added $2.14, or 1.3 percent, to $170.87, and the chip equipment maker Applied Materials rose $1.47, or 2.9 percent, to $52.09. The chip maker Nvidia advanced $3.09, or 1.8 percent, to $178.77.
The recent gains for tech companies have come in spite of a slump for Apple, the world's most valuable publicly traded company. While Apple has soared this year, it is down 4 percent since it announced its new line of iPhones and other products on Sept. 12.
KB Home advanced after its third-quarter profit and sales beat estimates. The stock rose $1.90, or 8.6 percent, to $24.12. Other home builders also rose. Meritage Homes picked up 85 cents, or 2 percent, to $44.40, and D.R. Horton advanced 95 cents, or 2.4 percent, to $39.93.
Oil prices recovered and turned higher just before the close of trading. Benchmark United States crude rose 11 cents to $51.67 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the standard for international oil prices, rose 13 cents to $57.54 a barrel in London.
In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline slid 3 cents to $1.61 a gallon. Heating oil declined 2 cents to $1.81 a gallon. Natural gas gave up 1 cent to $3.01 per 1,000 cubic feet.
Bond prices turned lower, pushing up the yield on the 10-year Treasury note to 2.33 percent from 2.31 percent.
Gold lost $3.90 to $1,284.80 an ounce, and silver slid 17 cents to $16.68 an ounce.
The dollar rose to 112.51 yen from 112.39 yen. The euro rose to $1.1816 from $1.1791.

Full text: NEW YORK -- Stock indexes in the United States finished barely higher on Tuesday after a late slump erased most of an early gain. Technology companies recovered some of the losses they took a day earlier, but energy companies and banks slipped. Strong gains for the software company Red Hat and recoveries for big names like Apple and Facebook helped technology companies move higher. Cruise lines rose after Carnival had a stronger third quarter than analysts expected. Small-company stocks continued to set record highs.
With little corporate or economic news to focus on, investors turned their attention to a speech by the Federal Reserve chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, for clues about the Fed's thinking on interest rates.
Ms. Yellen told a conference of economists that the Fed is puzzled that inflation remains so low. While she and other policy makers still think inflation will eventually reach the Fed's 2 percent target, Ms. Yellen conceded that the Fed may need to change its assumptions.
Ms. Yellen also said the Fed should take care not to raise rates too slowly. J J Kinahan, chief strategist for TD Ameritrade, said that was notable.
"That was a little bit stronger language than we've seen before," he said. Mr. Kinahan said investors have concluded over the last two weeks that the Fed will raise interest rates again in December, and Ms. Yellen's remarks did nothing to dispel that idea.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index added 0.18 points to 2,496.84. The Dow Jones industrial average, which rose as much as 73 points during the day, lost 11.77 points, almost 0.1 percent, to 22,284.32 as McDonald's fell and Chevron went into a late slide.
The Nasdaq composite index gained 9.57 points, or 0.2 percent, to 6,380.16 after a drop of 0.9 percent on Monday. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks gained 4.91 points, or 0.3 percent, to a record 1,456.86.
Carnival's third-quarter profit and revenue surpassed Wall Street's expectations. The cruise line raised its annual forecasts and said bookings and prices for next year are higher than at this time a year ago. Carnival gained $1.82, or 2.9 percent, to $65.32, and competitor Royal Caribbean Cruises rose $3.31, or 2.9 percent, to $117.19.
The open-source software maker Red Hat climbed $4.31, or 4.1 percent, to $110.07 after reporting a better-than-expected second quarter. The chip maker Nvidia rose after it said several major Chinese companies, including e-commerce giants Alibaba and Baidu, will use its products in data centers and cloud computing platforms. It added 96 cents to $171.96.
Apple picked up $2.59, or 1.7 percent, to $153.14, and Facebook rose $1.34 to $164.21.
Benchmark United States crude slid 34 cents to $51.88 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the standard for international oil prices, gave up 58 cents to $58.44 a barrel in London. Chevron gave up 47 cents to $117.52, and Schlumberger fell 83 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $68.82.
Equifax announced the retirement of its chairman and chief executive, Richard F. Smith, as the credit reporting agency tries to clean up a mess left by a data breach that exposed highly sensitive information about 143 million Americans.
Equifax fell early on, but recovered to finish 96 cents higher at $106.05.
Wholesale gasoline lost 2 cents to $1.70 a gallon. Heating oil retreated 1 cent to $1.85 a gallon. Natural gas remained at $2.92 per 1,000 cubic feet.
Bond prices declined. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.23 percent from 2.22 percent.
Gold lost $9.80 to $1,301.70 an ounce. Silver declined 26 cents to $16.88 an ounce. Copper fell 2 cents to $2.92 a pound.
The dollar rose to 112.17 yen from 111.61 yen. The euro fell to $1.1798 from $1.1846.

Welfare Revamp a Model For G.O.P.'s Health Plan

Full text: WASHINGTON -- As they propose to give each state a wad of federal cash to replace the Affordable Care Act's health insurance, Senate Republicans have a ready comparison to press their case: the overhaul of welfare adopted two decades ago. But the authors of the Senate's latest bill to repeal President Barack Obama's health law face one glaring flaw with the analogy: Few people would applaud a dramatic plunge in health insurance coverage the way they cheered the steep declines of the welfare rolls after the 1996 welfare law went into force.
For Republicans, the comparison makes for a compelling political argument.
"In 1996, we block granted money for welfare reform, and it worked like a charm," said Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, an architect of the health care plan. "We put governors in charge of the program. We held them accountable."
President Trump got into the act when he praised block grants on Twitter.
But health care is not welfare, and voters may not accept the analogy. The welfare law, signed by President Bill Clinton, ended the federal guarantee of cash assistance for the nation's poorest children and gave states vast new authority to run their own welfare and work programs with lump sums of federal money.
So too would the Senate Republican bill eliminate the entitlement to Medicaid and health insurance subsidies for many low-income people and would give the money to states, along with sweeping discretion over how to use it for health care or coverage.
"We give states the flexibility to come up with their own solutions," said Senator Bill Cassidy, Republican of Louisiana and a co-author of the health care bill with Mr. Graham. With that flexibility, he said, states will find that the money for health care block grants is adequate, just as they have found the welfare block grants.
Federal money for the basic welfare block grants has been set at $16.5 billion a year since 1996. If that sum was adjusted for inflation, it would be $25.5 billion.
"Do you ever hear a governor come to Washington and complain about not having enough money for their welfare program?" asked Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, the former senator who helped devise the latest Senate health bill. "No, you don't. Why? Because we gave them the money and the flexibility to be able to design a program that worked for them."
But it was easier for states to do more with less when they had fewer people to worry about. After the welfare law was enacted, the number of welfare recipients plunged more than 50 percent in five years, to 5.7 million in 2001, from 12.3 million in 1996.
An equivalent drop in the number of people with health insurance or insurance subsidies would probably not be viewed as a great success.
The goal in 1996 was to help people move from welfare to work. With health insurance, the goal is to increase enrollment. And no one advocates time limits for insurance like the time limits on cash assistance.
Mr. Graham said his bill, providing $1.2 trillion for states to share from 2020 to 2026, would allow federalism to flourish. It "gets the money and power out of Washington," he said, and "patients in this country will do better."
But Representative Sander M. Levin, Democrat of Michigan, said the welfare program, known as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, showed the risks of fiscal federalism.
"Those extolling the TANF block grant should check the record," Mr. Levin said. "Federal dollars have declined by one-third in real terms, states have diverted funds for other purposes, and as a result the number of poor children served by the program has shrunk to an all-time low. If we follow this model for health care, many millions of Americans will lose their health insurance."
Ronald T. Haskins, who helped write the 1996 welfare law as an aide to House Republicans, said it had clearly achieved one of its main purposes. "It has controlled spending," he said.
"It was $16.5 billion in 1997, the first year of TANF, and it's still $16.5 billion," he said. "We are saving 30 to 35 percent, billions and billions of dollars, because there is no adjustment for inflation or population growth."
On the other hand, Mr. Haskins said: "If you want to make sure people get health care or coverage with a block grant, that's questionable. Over the years you will have to do more with less. States will have less money. That normally means they'll have less coverage."
One goal of the 1996 law was to require adult welfare recipients to work. To the consternation of conservatives, the flexibility provided by the welfare block grant has allowed some states to avoid the work requirements.
Conservatives worry that the Graham-Cassidy bill could allow states to set up and operate "single-payer" health care systems with federal block grant funds. Mr. Graham did nothing to allay this concern when he said last week on the Senate floor, "If California wants to go to single-payer health care, it can."
That possibility alarms insurers. In a letter to Senate leaders last week, America's Health Insurance Plans, a lobby for the industry, said the Graham-Cassidy bill could undercut the private market by "allowing government-controlled, single-payer health care to grow."
Until the recession began in late 2007, the welfare overhaul was generally viewed as a success. Large numbers of single mothers took jobs in a strong economy as states revamped their welfare programs to emphasize work.
But the number of welfare recipients did not increase much when the economy softened and poverty inched up in the recession. Since 1996, the proportion of poor families with children who receive cash assistance has plummeted by about two-thirds.
"The program has provided a temporary safety net to fewer and fewer poor families," said LaDonna A. Pavetti, a vice president of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal-leaning research and advocacy group.
Welfare is thus a poor model for health care, Democrats say.
"The Graham-Cassidy bill gives a super block grant blank check to the states," said Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the senior Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee. "They can do whatever they want in terms of Americans' health care, and it guts the funding for those block grants over a very short period of time. This will mean a whale of a lot of pain for vulnerable people."

Full text: Here's what to expect in the week ahead: ADVERTISING
Advertisers, in throes of change, meet for week of talks.
Marketers and advertising types will gather this week in New York -- mostly in the Times Square area -- for the annual industry event known as Advertising Week. Panels and presentations like "Can Brands Actually Tell a Story in 6 Seconds?" and "Realizing The Full Potential of Audience Targeting" will aim to provide insights to an industry grappling with significant changes in technology, culture and consumer habits. Other hot topics of discussion: the recent criticism of the ad targeting practices of Google and Facebook, diversity within the advertising world and how well the industry knows Americans after a presidential election that caught most of its leaders by surprise. Sapna Maheshwari
ECONOMY
Mario Draghi will discuss monetary policy.
Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, will provide an update on monetary policy during an appearance at the European Parliament in Brussels on Monday. But Mr. Draghi is unlikely to offer much new information on the question that is occupying financial markets: when the central bank will ease its stimulus to the eurozone economy. Mr. Draghi appears periodically before the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee and answers questions from representatives, but usually does not use the venue to signal major policy changes. Jack Ewing
Janet Yellen to speak about inflation.
"Inflation, Uncertainty and Monetary Policy" is not just the title of a speech that Janet L. Yellen, the Fed's chairwoman, will deliver in Cleveland on Tuesday. It is also a pretty good title for the dilemma that is confronting the Federal Reserve. The Fed has undershot its target of 2 percent annual inflation for the last five years, and is likely to do so again this year. In recent months, inflation has weakened further, and Fed officials don't really understand why (Ms. Yellen described it as a "mystery" last week). At stake is whether the Fed should raise its benchmark interest rate in December, or wait for inflation to show signs of a rebound. After Ms. Yellen's speech, she will visit a community college job training program and participate in a discussion with students. Ms. Yellen has previously visited job training programs in Chicago, Boston and Philadelphia, making the trip something of an annual tradition. Binyamin Appelbaum
TRADE POLICY
A trade case could reshape the airplane industry.
The Department of Commerce is expected to issue an initial ruling Tuesday on imposing duties on the Canadian airplane maker Bombardier, after Boeing claimed that its Canadian rival had received government subsidies that allowed it to sell its products at unfairly low prices. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada and Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain, whose constituents help to manufacture the Bombardier jet, have urged President Trump to intervene to stop the case, but have so far been unsuccessful. If the United States rules in Boeing's favor, it may impose duties making the Canadian aircraft substantially more expensive. Ana Swanson
TECHNOLOGY
Google faces deadline to comply with an antitrust order.
Google must be in compliance with an order from European Union regulators to modify its business practices by Thursday. The order was part of a decision in June by the European Commission that included a record fine of 2.4 billion euros ($2.7 billion). Google faced a 90-day deadline to respond to the regulator's demands or face penalties of up to 5 percent of the average daily global revenue of Alphabet, its parent company. In recent weeks, Google submitted proposals to the commission aimed at ensuring that rival shopping services are treated the same way as its Google Shopping service, but the company has not publicly disclosed them. James Kanter
ECONOMY
Bank of England marks two decades of independence.
The Bank of England will hold a conference on Thursday to mark 20 years since it was granted independence over monetary policy, giving the bank the ability to decide on interest rates without the government. The central bank's powers have since expanded to include the regulation of financial firms. Speakers at the conference will discuss the application of central bank independence and whether the model works. Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England for 10 years until 2013, has written that, "independence is not an answer to all problems." Amie Tsang

Full text: Before John McCain put yet another Republican health care plan on life support on Friday, I was going to do with the Graham-Cassidy legislation what I've done with previous Republican bills, and weigh the plausible ideas that it contains against its hastily rigged-up architecture and predictable G.O.P. stinginess. But sometimes, when a party has spent most of a year producing health care bills that excite almost nobody and that even the senators voting for them can't effectively defend, it's worth stepping back and thinking about our national priorities.
This goes for both parties: not only the stepping-on-rakes Republicans, but the suddenly single-payer-dreaming Democrats. If Obamacare repeal is really dead for the year 2017, both left and right have a chance to shake their minds free of the health care debate and ask themselves: What are the biggest threats to the American Dream right now, to our unity and prosperity, our happiness and civic health?
I would suggest that there are two big answers, both of which played crucial roles in getting a carnival showman who promised to Make America Great Again elected president. First, an economic stagnation that we are only just now, eight years into an economic recovery, beginning to escape -- a stagnation that has left median incomes roughly flat for almost a generation, encouraged populism on the left and right, and made every kind of polarization that much worse.
Second, a social crisis that the opioid epidemic has thrown into horrifying relief, but that was apparent in other indicators for a while -- in the decline of marriage, rising suicide rates, an upward lurch in mortality for poorer whites, a historically low birthrate, a large-scale male abandonment of the work force, a dissolving trend in religious and civic life, a crisis of patriotism, belonging, trust.
Now a follow-up question: Is the best way to address either of these crises to spend the next five years constantly uprooting and replanting health insurance systems, and letting health care consume every hour of debate?
That appears to be what some on both sides want to happen. The latest Republican plan would push most of Obamacare's funding down to the state level, theoretically limiting the issue's role in national debates. Except that it wouldn't. Every state-by-state fiasco (and there would be many) would bring calls to recentralize, every federal regulatory decision would be litigated furiously, and the issue would dominate the 2020 campaign at the state and federal levels both.
And if the Democrats, having blown up the insurance system once to implement Obamacare, really rallied around a Bernie Sanders-style proposal to do it all over again but on a bigger scale? Then not only would 2020 be a health care election, but if the Democrat won, the next two years would be consumed by outlandish single-payer expectations.
Where would that leave our two big problems, stagnation and the social crisis? Certainly health care is connected to both of them, because everything is always connected. Conservatives will point out that the way health care costs eat into paychecks is part of the story of stagnation. Liberals will respond that universal health insurance helps stabilize and lift up the working class. Conservatives will object that Medicaid reduces work-force participation and possibly subsidizes opioid addiction and that its value to beneficiaries is overstated. And so on.
But when your main challenges involve men who aren't working, wages that aren't rising, families that aren't forming and communities that are collapsing, constantly overhauling health insurance is at best an indirect response, at worst a non sequitur. Especially since right now health care inflation is relatively low, the deficit has temporarily stabilized and Obamacare is less disruptive than both optimistic and pessimistic accounts suggested.
There are better options for both parties. Republicans could get off the repeal-and-replace merry-go-round and actually try to govern on a version of the Trump agenda: With one hand, cut corporate taxes and slash regulations to spur growth; with the other, spend on infrastructure to boost blue-collar work, cut payroll taxes and increase the child tax credit, and push to reduce low-skilled immigration. Pay for some of it with caps on tax breaks, let paying for the rest wait for another day.
Democrats, meanwhile, could let single-payer dreams wait (or just die) and think instead about spending that supports work and family directly. They could look at proposals for a larger earned-income tax credit, a family allowance, and let the "job guarantee" and "guaranteed basic income" factions fight things out. If they want to go big in 2020, they could run on wage subsidies and public works, not another disruptive health care vision.
Health care reform was the Barack Obama presidency's main achievement, but it crippled his administration politically once it passed. Obamacare repeal has devoured the first year of the Trump presidency, with nothing to show for it. The country has bigger problems than its insurance system. It's time for both parties to act like it.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The White House has created a list of about a half-dozen candidates to be the next leader of the Federal Reserve, including its current chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, and the president's chief economic adviser, Gary D. Cohn, according to two administration officials and a third person with knowledge of the process. The list also includes Jerome H. Powell, a member of the Fed's board of governors; Kevin Warsh, a former Fed governor; and the Stanford University economist John B. Taylor, the officials said. Preliminary interviews with some candidates have already begun with an eye toward presenting finalists to President Trump later this year.
Ms. Yellen, whose four-year term ends in February, has been unusually successful in achieving the Fed's goals of minimizing unemployment and moderating inflation. But Mr. Trump, while praising her performance, has said that he may decide not to reappoint her.
"I like her and I respect her, but I haven't made that decision yet," Mr. Trump told reporters this month.
Uncertainty about Mr. Trump's decision is already causing some unease in financial markets. Ms. Yellen has charted a steady course for monetary policy in the coming years: gradual increases in interest rates and a gradual reduction in the Fed's bond holdings. But some of the candidates Mr. Trump is considering, including Mr. Warsh and Mr. Taylor, have argued that the Fed should raise rates and reverse its postcrisis buildup of bonds more quickly.
The Fed chairman also plays a leading role in financial regulation and will have to navigate calls by Republican leaders, including Mr. Trump, to roll back some of the rules put in place after the 2008 financial crisis. Ms. Yellen was a principal architect of those more stringent regulations and has said the financial system is much stronger as a result. Mr. Trump has criticized many of the banking rules, saying they are excessive and impeding economic growth. The candidates to replace Ms. Yellen all share those concerns to varying degrees.
Given the high stakes, Mr. Trump's decision has become a source of intrigue in political and economic circles this year. There is also a growing sense of urgency: Both Ms. Yellen and her predecessor, Ben S. Bernanke, were nominated in October, leaving ample time for the Senate to hold confirmation hearings. Mr. Trump has said he does not plan to make a decision until later in the year, leaving little time for the Senate to act given the tight calendar. Aides say he is not yet focused on the search. Additional candidates could ultimately be considered.
The administration officials and the other person with knowledge of the search requested anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the job in question. A White House spokeswoman had no immediate comment, and Mr. Cohn, Mr. Taylor and Mr. Warsh did not respond to requests for comment. A Fed spokeswoman said Ms. Yellen and Mr. Powell declined to comment.
The next Fed chairman is likely to begin the four-year term in an atmosphere of relative tranquillity during one of the longest economic expansions in American history. But the Fed is confronting a number of difficult issues. One question is whether it can do more to increase economic growth. Another is whether the Fed will be ready for the next economic downturn.
In addition to a Fed chairman, Mr. Trump also must fill four open seats on the seven-member board. That means he can immediately appoint a majority of Fed governors, putting his stamp on the institution. He has made just one choice so far, nominating Randal K. Quarles to be the Fed's vice chairman for supervision. That nomination is pending, though Mr. Quarles is expected to be confirmed.
Mr. Trump has deputized four officials to lead the selection process for the Fed's next chairman, said one person familiar with the search: Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin; two of Mr. Cohn's aides on the National Economic Council, Jeremy Katz and Andrew Olmem; and John DeStefano, the White House personnel director.
Mr. Cohn, who initially participated in conversations about the potential nominees for Fed governor seats, has removed himself from the discussions about the central bank's next chairman, given that he is a potential candidate for the job, said several people with knowledge of his involvement.
Mr. Cohn left the No. 2 position at Goldman Sachs to join Mr. Trump's administration as head of the National Economic Council. He quickly developed an easy rapport with the president, who is said to value Mr. Cohn's knowledge of markets and finance. Mr. Cohn has played a major role in the administration's push for a tax-cut bill; he also has been a moderating voice in internal debates on issues like restricting free trade.
In a July interview with The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Trump described Mr. Cohn and Ms. Yellen as candidates for the Fed job. The next month, Mr. Cohn publicly criticized the president's response to a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, creating tension. But the two men have reestablished a comfort level, and Mr. Cohn remains a candidate.
Mr. Cohn is a strong advocate for easing financial regulation, which he argues is unnecessarily impeding economic activity. But he has rarely spoken publicly about monetary policy; the other four candidates whose names are known all have significant experience with monetary policy.
Mr. Warsh, who served on the Fed's board between 2006 and 2011, was a member of Mr. Trump's business advisory council and has informally advised him on a range of economic issues. That may be a significant advantage, given the president's demonstrated preference for people he knows and trusts. Mr. Warsh is married to Jane Lauder, the daughter of Ronald Lauder, a friend and occasional adviser to the president.
Mr. Warsh is a lawyer by training and a banker by trade before entering public service in 2002 as a member of President George W. Bush's National Economic Council. After leaving the Fed, he joined the Hoover Institution, a public-policy think tank run by Stanford, as a visiting fellow. He has been a vocal critic of the Fed's economic stimulus campaign under both Mr. Bernanke and Ms. Yellen, arguing it has been ineffective and may have dangerous side effects.
At a Hoover conference in May, he said the Fed needs to be "aggressive and powerful" in responding to financial crises, but remain "more traditional" when the market is not in crisis.
Mr. Taylor, a colleague of Mr. Warsh's at Hoover, has offered a similar critique of Fed policy. Mr. Taylor served in the Treasury Department during the Bush administration but he is best known as an academic economist. He wrote a formulaic approach to monetary policy, known as the "Taylor Rule," which suggests that the Fed should be raising rates more quickly. He also has closely advised House Republicans on legislation that would require the Fed to adopt such a policy rule.
Mr. Powell, the only Republican on the Fed's board, is regarded as a centrist voice on both monetary policy and regulatory issues. In internal discussions and public remarks, he has sometimes pushed back against the most ardent supporters of the Fed's postcrisis stimulus campaign. Similarly, he has sometimes raised questions about changes in financial regulation. But on both fronts he has consistently voted with the majority.
A Treasury Department official under President George H.W. Bush, Mr. Powell then built a fortune as a partner at the Carlyle Group, a private equity firm, before he was nominated to the Fed by President Obama in 2012. His experience at the Fed, and his connections both in the financial world and in the Republican Party, could make him an attractive candidate. But his track record suggests he may be less likely than some of the other candidates to press for dramatic changes in monetary and regulatory policies.

Full text: Graham-Cassidy, the health bill the Senate may vote on next week, is stunningly cruel. It's also incompetently drafted: The bill's sponsors clearly had no idea what they were doing when they put it together. Furthermore, their efforts to sell the bill involve obvious, blatant lies. Nonetheless, the bill could pass. And that says a lot about today's Republican Party, none of it good.
The Affordable Care Act, which has reduced the percentage of Americans without health insurance to a record low, created a three-legged stool: regulations that prevent insurers from discriminating against people with pre-existing conditions, a requirement that individuals have adequate insurance (and thus pay into the system while healthy) and subsidies to make that insurance affordable. For the lowest-income families, insurance is provided directly by Medicaid.
Graham-Cassidy saws off all three legs of that stool. Like other Republican plans, it eliminates the individual mandate. It replaces direct aid to individuals with block grants to states, under a formula that sharply reduces funding relative to current law, and especially penalizes states that have done a good job of reducing the number of uninsured. And it effectively eliminates protection for Americans with pre-existing conditions.
Did Graham-Cassidy's sponsors know what they were doing when putting this bill together? Almost surely not, or they wouldn't have produced something that everyone, and I mean everyone, who knows anything about health care warns would cause chaos.
It's not just progressives: The American Medical Association, the insurance industry and Blue Cross/Blue Shield have all warned that markets would be destabilized and millions would lose coverage.
How many people would lose insurance? Republicans are trying to ram the bill through before the Congressional Budget Office has time to analyze it -- an attempt that is in itself a violation of all previous norms, and amounts to an admission that the bill can't bear scrutiny. But C.B.O. has analyzed other bills containing some of Graham-Cassidy's provisions, and these previous analyses suggest that it would add more than 30 million people to the ranks of the uninsured.
Lindsey Graham, Bill Cassidy, and the bill's other sponsors have responded to these critiques the old-fashioned way -- with lies.
Both Cassidy and Graham insist that their bill would continue to protect Americans with pre-existing conditions -- a claim that will come as news to the A.M.A., Blue Cross and everyone else who has read the bill's text.
Cassidy has also circulated a spreadsheet that purports to show most states actually getting increased funding under his bill. But the spreadsheet doesn't compare funding with current law, which is the relevant question. Instead, it shows changes over time in dollar amounts.
That's actually a well-known dodge, one that Republicans have been using since Newt Gingrich tried to gut Medicare in the 1990s. As everyone in Congress -- even Cassidy -- surely knows, such comparisons drastically understate the real size of cuts, since under current law spending is expected to rise with inflation and population growth.
Independent analyses find that most states would, in fact, experience serious cuts in federal aid -- and everyone would face huge cuts after 2027.
So we're looking at an incompetently drafted bill that would hurt millions of people, whose sponsors are trying to sell it with transparently false claims. How is it that this bill might nonetheless pass the Senate?
One answer is that Republicans are desperate to destroy President Barack Obama's legacy in any way possible, no matter how many American lives they ruin in the process.
Another answer is that most Republican legislators neither know nor care about policy substance. This is especially true on health care, where they never tried to understand why Obamacare looks the way it does, or how to devise a nonvicious alternative. Vox asked a number of G.O.P. senators to explain what Graham-Cassidy does; the answers ranged from incoherence to belligerence to belligerent incoherence.
I'd add that the evasions and lies we're seeing on this bill have been standard G.O.P. operating procedure for years. The trick of converting federal programs into block grants, then pretending that this wouldn't mean savage cuts, was central to every one of Paul Ryan's much-hyped budgets. The trick of comparing dollar numbers over time to conceal huge benefit cuts has, as I already noted, been around since the 1990s.
In other words, Graham-Cassidy isn't an aberration; it's more like the distilled essence of everything wrong with modern Republicans.
Will this awful bill become law? I have no idea. But even if the handful of Republican senators who retain some conscience block it -- we're looking at you, John McCain -- the underlying sickness of the G.O.P. will remain.
It's sort of a pre-existing condition, and it's poisoning America.

After Fed Forecast, Indexes Wobble but Finish Higher

Full text: Stock indexes in the United States overcame an afternoon wobble to close mostly higher on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve said it would start reducing its huge bond portfolio next month and was still on track to raise interest rates later this year. The central bank's announcement drove bond yields higher, lifting shares in banks and other financial companies. Banks benefit from higher bond yields because it means they can charge higher interest rates on loans.
High-dividend stocks like utilities and household goods makers fell. Income-seeking investors find those stocks less appealing when bond yields move higher.
"The announcement was pretty much in line with what was expected," said David Chalupnik, head of equities at Nuveen Asset Management. "So far, the market is taking it in stride, but I don't know if it should. This will slowly impact growth."
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index inched up 1.59 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,508.24. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 41.79 points, or 0.2 percent, to 22,412.59. The modest gains nudged both indexes to record highs, extending a run of milestones that stretches back to last week.
The Nasdaq composite lost 5.28 points, or 0.1 percent, to 6,456.04. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks added 5.02 points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,445.42.
Trading on Wall Street had been mostly subdued this week ahead of the Fed's announcement.
Fed policy makers decided to leave the central bank's short-term benchmark interest rate between 1 percent and 1.25 percent, but also said they still expect to increase the rate one more time this year and three times in 2018, if persistently low inflation rebounds.
The Fed has modestly raised the rate four times since December 2015 after keeping it at a record low for seven years after the 2008 financial crisis.
In addition, the Fed said it will begin to gradually unwind its $4.5 trillion balance sheet next month. The portfolio primarily consists of government and mortgage-backed bonds. The move will gradually increase long-term borrowing rates.
The prospect of another Fed rate hike this year, when the American economy is growing modestly and may slow somewhat from the impact of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, could be bad news for stocks the next few weeks, Mr. Chalupnik said.
After the Fed's announcement, bond prices slumped, sending the yield on the 10-year Treasury note to 2.27 percent from 2.25 percent late Tuesday.
The Fed statement also sent the dollar higher against other currencies. The dollar rose to 112.38 yen from 111.50 yen on Tuesday. The euro weakened to $1.1885 from $1.1997.
Technology companies were among the biggest decliners. Qorvo slid $4, or 5.4 percent, to $70.32. Adobe Systems also slumped. The business software company posted solid quarterly results, but investors were concerned about the performance of its cloud business. The stock lost $6.64, or 4.2 percent, to $149.96.
Bed Bath and Beyond plunged 15.9 percent after the home goods retailer reported that its latest quarterly sales at stores open at least a year fell short of analysts' forecasts. The stock lost $4.29 to $22.74.
Investors also weighed new data on the United States housing market that showed sales of previously occupied homes fell 1.7 percent in August. Over the past 12 months, home sales have risen only 0.2 percent. The report from the National Association of Realtors pulled down homebuilder shares. CalAtlantic Group fell the most, shedding 97 cents, or 2.7 percent, to $34.60.
Benchmark United States crude added 93 cents, or 1.9 percent, to settle at $50.41 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, used to price international oils, gained $1.15, or 2.1 percent, to $56.29 a barrel in London.
Wholesale gasoline was little changed at $1.66 a gallon. Heating oil added 3 cents to $1.81 a gallon. Natural gas declined 3 cents to $3.09 per 1,000 cubic feet.
Gold gained $5.80 to $1,316.40 an ounce. Silver rose 6 cents to $17.33 an ounce. Copper held steady at $2.97 a pound.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Nearly a decade after the Federal Reserve embarked on an unprecedented effort to shore up the collapsing American economy, the central bank said on Wednesday that it would begin withdrawing some of the trillions of dollars it invested in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. The decision, while widely expected, is nevertheless a significant sign that the Fed is confident that economic growth and low unemployment will continue. In other words, the central bank believes that the American economy has emerged safely from the crisis.
"The basic message here is U.S. economic performance has been good," Janet L. Yellen, the Fed's chairwoman, said at a news conference following a two-day meeting of the Fed's policy committee.
The Fed's retreat from its post-crisis stimulus campaign will be slow but steady as the central bank looks to shrink the enormous $4 trillion portfolio it amassed through a bond-buying spree.
Those efforts, known as quantitative easing, plunged the Fed into uncharted waters as it tried to navigate the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. The Fed came under stiff criticism for the program, prompting many Republican lawmakers to question whether the Fed should remain independent.
The Fed, which stopped its buying spree in 2014, is now preparing to pare back its holdings by about $10 billion per month initially. That is likely to raise borrowing costs for consumers and businesses, but only very slowly. Indeed, since the Fed ended its bond-buying, countervailing factors have actually reduced some borrowing costs, like the average interest rate on 30-year mortgages.
Investors are watching warily, but so far there is little sign that the Fed's retreat is tightening financial conditions. Stock prices fell modestly after the Fed's 2 p.m. policy announcement, but bounced back by the end of the trading day. The S&P 500 index rose 1.59 points, closing at 2,508.24.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury also rose 0.02 percentage points, closing at 2.27 percent.
"The Fed did an extremely good job of preparing us for commencing the balance sheet rundown," said Peter Hooper, chief economist at Deutsche Bank. "That's happening with a whimper, but handled differently, it could have been a big event."
The Fed, which has raised its benchmark interest rate twice this year, left that rate unchanged Wednesday, but indicated that it plans a third rate increase later this year as economic conditions continue to strengthen. The Fed said it expects the labor market to continue strengthening and the economy to expand at a moderate pace.
Twelve of the 16 officials on the Federal Open Market Committee predicted another rate increase this year, the same number as in the Fed's last round of forecasts in June.
In its post-meeting statement, the Fed pointed to the strength of job growth and increases in household and business spending. The official optimism went only so far, however. Growth remains weak by historical standards, and the Fed indicated it sees no evidence of acceleration. Fed officials once again reduced their expectations for rate increases in coming years. The median prediction Wednesday was that the benchmark rate will stabilize at 2.8 percent, down from a median estimate of 3 percent in June.
The Fed's benchmark rate now sits in a range between 1 percent and 1.25 percent, a level most Fed officials regard as providing modest encouragement for borrowing.
Expectations of a third rate increase this year strengthened after the Fed's announcement, rising from a 57 percent chance to a 71 percent chance, according to CME Group.
The Fed's next meeting is scheduled for Oct. 31 and Nov. 1, but the Fed is unlikely to raise rates any sooner than its final meeting of the year, in mid-December.
Some economic indicators suggest that higher rates are warranted: The unemployment rate, at 4.4 percent in August, is below the level most officials regard as sustainable. Moreover, Fed officials predicted that the rate would fall to 4.1 percent next year.
But other economic measures paint a contrasting picture. Job growth remains strong, suggesting that the work force is still expanding; wage growth is modest, suggesting employers are still able to find workers with relative ease; and inflation weakened in recent months, puzzling Fed officials and economists who had predicted that prices would begin to rise more quickly as labor market conditions tightened.
The Fed's preferred measure of price inflation increased by just 1.4 percent during the 12 months ending in July, the most recent available data. The Fed is likely to undershoot its target of 2 percent annual inflation for the sixth consecutive year. That has caused consternation among some economists and Fed officials, who are wary of raising rates given the Fed's inability so far to achieve its inflation objectives.
"I can't say this year that I can easily point to a sufficient set of factors" to explain low inflation, Ms. Yellen said Wednesday. She added, however, that low inflation this year did not imply low inflation next year. "What we need to do is figure out whether the factors that have lowered inflation are going to prove persistent," she said.
Ms. Yellen said that weak inflation readings earlier this year "reflect developments that are largely unrelated to broader economic conditions." Similarly, she said that the Fed expected the impact of hurricanes on gas prices to increase inflation temporarily. So far, the Fed's assessment of underlying conditions remains unchanged: Ms. Yellen and her colleagues expect inflation to stabilize at its target of 2 percent a year.
The Fed wants to use its benchmark rate to manage economic conditions while gradually draining its investment portfolio in the background. When Ms. Yellen described the Fed's plans in June, she expressed hope that the process would be like "watching paint dry."
The Fed holds about $4.2 trillion in Treasury securities and mortgage bonds, which it accumulated to put downward pressure on interest rates. It must regularly replenish its holdings as bonds mature. Beginning in October, it plans to withhold $10 billion a month from the reinvestment process -- in effect causing that much money to disappear.
It will then increase the pace by $10 billion each quarter until reaching a monthly rate of $50 billion, and then maintain that pace until it reaches an unspecified finishing line.
Ms. Yellen emphasized that the Fed did not plan to adjust that schedule, although she added, "unless we think that the threat to the economy is sufficiently great."
The retreat will put modest upward pressure on borrowing costs, but businesses and consumers are unlikely to see much difference in the near term. "You will see a gradual tightening of financial conditions that will come from the Fed shrinking its balance sheet," said Lewis Alexander, chief United States economist at Nomura Securities.
Still, questions remain, both about the market's reaction and about the goal. Before the crisis, the Fed held less than $900 billion in assets, and most analysts expect the Fed to maintain a significantly larger balance sheet going forward -- both because the financial system has grown and because the Fed has expanded its role in maintaining the system.
The Fed's slow pace also means it will take years to rebuild its ability to respond to crises. It does not expect its benchmark rate to reach 2.8 percent for three years, and it expects to take even longer to reduce its balance sheet.
"If we get a severe adverse shock in the next couple of years and interest rates are still pretty low and the balance sheet is still pretty big, what in the world are we going to do?" asked Andrew Levin, a Dartmouth College professor of economics.
Ms. Yellen paused when she was asked that question on Wednesday.
"We have a certain amount of room now," she finally said.
She noted that the Fed could buy more bonds. It could also engage in "forward guidance," or promising keep rates at a low level for a specified period.
The Fed also noted the impact of three recent hurricanes, including one that was striking Puerto Rico on Wednesday, but said the resulting economic disruptions were likely to be temporary.
"Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria have devastated many communities, inflicting severe hardship," the Fed said. "Storm-related disruptions and rebuilding will affect economic activity in the near term, but past experience suggests that the storms are unlikely to materially alter the course of the national economy over the medium term."

Full text: Is a new golden age for the American worker around the corner? For the last couple of years, workers' median earnings have been rising on a sustained path not seen in years.
This may come as a surprise after decades of wage stagnation, when the good jobs of an earlier industrial era -- in which workers could go straight from high school to a lifelong place on the factory floor, with a pension on the other end -- have largely disappeared, replaced in many cases by work with little security, uncertain hours and few if any benefits.
Still, the wage picture is looking decidedly brighter. In 2008, in the midst of the recession, the average hourly pay of production and nonsupervisory workers tracked by the Bureau of Labor Statistics -- those who toil at a cash register or on a shop floor -- was 10 percent below its 1973 peak after accounting for inflation. Since then, wages have regained virtually all of that ground. Median wages for all full-time workers are rising at a pace last achieved in the dot-com boom at the end of the Clinton administration.
And with employers adding more than two million jobs a year, some economists suspect that American workers -- after being pummeled by a furious mix of globalization and automation, strangled by monetary policy that has restrained economic activity in the name of low inflation, and slapped around by government hostility toward unions and labor regulations -- may finally be in for a break.
But even as they forecast a brighter future for the working class, these economists also worry that the new age of tight labor markets and rising wages will create a different sort of challenge. As Alan B. Krueger, a Princeton University economist who was the chief economic adviser to President Barack Obama, put it, "We are heading for a labor shortage."
Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody's Analytics, concurs. "Our problem going forward isn't going to be unemployment," he told me. "Over the next 20 to 25 years, a labor shortage is going to put a binding constraint on growth."
Converging factors are at play, Mr. Zandi contended. The Federal Reserve is likely to allow the economy to run "on the hot side." Years of exceptionally low inflation have finally convinced the Fed to drop its overriding anti-inflationary bias, forged in the high-inflation era of President Jimmy Carter, and to put more weight on the impact that high interest rates have on employment.
Manufacturing workers have probably already lost all the jobs to globalization that they were going to lose, Mr. Zandi said. Rather than "take" more American jobs, hundreds of millions of Chinese workers who have joined the global middle class over the last two decades will instead "create" jobs in the United States by buying American-made goods and services.
And even as demand for workers accelerates across the United States, employers must contend with the unflinching force of demography: a work force that is growing at its slowest pace in over a half-century, as baby boomers who joined the labor force from the 1960s to the 1980s now gradually age out of it.
More than seven years after the recession ended and the job market began to bounce back, only 60 percent of Americans over the age of 16 are working, about 2.5 percentage points fewer than just before the economy took a dive.
On average, Mr. Zandi pointed out, aging will slice about a quarter of a percentage point from the labor-force participation rate -- the share of Americans either employed or looking for a job -- over the next 10 years. By the end of that period, the labor force may even be shrinking.
Policy makers who spent their careers pondering the lackluster demand for workers will have to turn their attention to a problem they have not had to fret about much in at least a generation: how to pull more able-bodied people into the work force to offset a wave of retirements.
"We have had real wage growth, but the labor supply has been flat for the last two years," Professor Krueger said. "We get a very small number of workers back with higher wages, just enough to offset the people leaving the labor force because they are older." The critical question for policy is what other tools are available to draw them back.
And the answer requires removing a roadblock standing in the way of this potential golden age: Even if demand for workers is rising, it may not be for the kind of workers on offer, those sitting on the sidelines of the labor force. "The jobs in demand are more skilled than the workers we have," Professor Krueger told me.
The share of men in their prime working years -- 25 to 54 -- who are in the labor force has declined steadily since the end of World War II. Workers without a college degree have clocked out at increasing rates, as imports and automation undercut their wages.
For years, the economy hardly noticed because women were rushing to work in droves, offsetting the retreat among men. But that trend faded around the turn of the century. Since then, the labor-force participation rate of prime-age Americans has shrunk to nearly the lowest in the industrialized world.
And, as Professor Krueger noted, once workers stop looking for a job, it is tough to draw them back in. "After they leave the labor market," he said, "people reorganize their lives."
Indeed. A third of the prime-age workers who have left the labor force are now receiving disability benefits, meaning they are out for good, Professor Krueger estimated. Another 20 percent are in the process of applying for such benefits. In a recently released study, he estimated that about a third of prime-age men not in the labor force use prescription painkillers, namely opiates, suggesting that they will not be returning to work soon. Professor Krueger suggests that the increase in opioid prescriptions could account for about 20 percent of the decline in men's labor-force participation from 1999 to 2015, and 25 percent of the observed decline in women's labor-force participation.
How to get them back? In a coming study, Melissa Kearney and Katharine Abraham of the University of Maryland identify forces that have pushed workers out of the labor force before the retirement age of 65. Trade is at the top of the list, followed by technology -- be it robots or other forms of automation -- and disability insurance, which offers people some income in the absence of a job. Supply-side factors -- incarceration, or the effect of the minimum wage on labor costs -- are next.
Professor Kearney and Professor Abraham also identify policies that might draw more workers back into jobs: Improving access to high-quality education, an elusive goal despite recent gains, is critical to equip students to navigate a changing workplace. So is access to child care, to lower barriers to women's participation in the work force. Expanding wage supports like the earned-income tax credit will be important to make work worthwhile for workers of lesser skills. On the supply side, Professor Kearney and Professor Abraham suggest that being cautious about raising the minimum wage, which could price some workers out of jobs, and reforming disability insurance to encourage recipients to seek jobs.
There is more. Discouraging the overprescription of painkillers seems like an obvious choice, given Professor Krueger's findings. There is also a clear list of things not to be done.
For instance, restricting immigration is not the smartest policy when workers are scarce. Raising barriers to imports -- inviting retaliation from trading partners -- is exactly the wrong approach, especially now that the workers in cheap labor markets that put such pressure on American jobs promise to become big consumers of things made in America.
If the goal is to protect economic growth and to give American workers a shot at a new golden age of employment, closing the door on the world economy is not the solution.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve, which invested trillions of dollars to prop up the American economy after the 2008 financial crisis, is finally ready to take away the crutches. The Fed is expected to announce on Wednesday that it will gradually reduce its $4.2 trillion portfolio of United States Treasury debt and mortgage-backed securities, a move that would amount to a vote of confidence that the economy's slow-but-steady growth is likely to continue.
The Fed, concerned about the reaction in financial markets, has tried to eliminate any suspense by publishing a detailed schedule and promising to move very slowly. But just as the Fed's bond purchases after the 2008 crisis were unprecedented, the retreat will again take the reserve banking system into uncharted territory. No one can be certain what will happen.
"What the Fed is going to do this week will not surprise anyone," said Lewis Alexander, chief United States economist at Nomura Securities. "And the models predict a slow and smooth adjustment. But there is always a risk of more volatility."
Two large and related questions also remain unanswered. The Fed has not said how large it would like its balance sheet to be, so there is no finish line for the retreat. Also, there is a good chance the Fed's current leadership will not complete the journey. Janet L. Yellen, the Fed chairwoman, ends a four-year term in early February, and President Trump has not announced whether he plans to nominate her for a second term.
The Fed responded to the crisis that began a decade ago by cutting its benchmark interest rate nearly to zero, and by vacuuming up huge quantities of bonds. Both measures were designed to revive economic activity by reducing borrowing costs for everything from mortgages to car loans.
The first round of bond-buying, often called "quantitative easing," or QE, began during the crisis and there is broad agreement that it helped to bolster financial markets.
The second and third rounds, which came after the crisis, remain controversial.
Buying a bond is the same thing has lending money to the seller. Buyers compete by offering to accept lower rates. The Fed's massive purchases increased competition for available Treasuries and thus drove down interest rates.
In an April analysis, Fed economists reported that the purchases reduced the yield of the benchmark 10-year Treasury by 1 percentage point.
The Fed's purchases of mortgage bonds had a similar effect.
Fed officials, and a wide range of independent economists, argue that the downward pressure on Treasury rates rippled outward to other kinds of borrowing costs, as private investors moved into other markets in search of better returns.
These impacts, however, are difficult to measure, and some independent economists argue that any broad economic benefits were modest, at best.
"There has been an explosion of research, dozens and dozens of papers, and almost all of them agree that QE lowered bond yields," said Joseph Gagnon, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. "The financial market effects are very clear. Did that stimulate growth? Did that stimulate inflation? It's always impossible to prove, but all the models we have imply it should have helped."
Critics foresaw negative consequences. A group of prominent conservatives warned in an open letter in 2010 that the Fed's purchases "risk currency debasement and inflation." Four years later, some signatories doubled down on those warnings. But there has been no resurgence of inflation. Indeed, the Fed is struggling with the opposite problem: Inflation has remained persistently below its 2 percent annual target.
The Fed's program was intended to encourage risk-taking by investors, but some critics warned it would create new asset bubbles. Those warnings have not yet been borne out.
The Fed's retreat began two years ago, when the central bank raised its benchmark interest rate for the first time since the crisis. It now sits between 1 percent and 1.25 percent. The Fed is not expected to raise rates on Wednesday. Job growth has remained strong this year, but some officials are worried about the persistent weakness of inflation.
The Fed plans to reduce its bond holdings with similar care. It plans to cut $10 billion a month for the first three months, divided 60-40 between Treasuries and mortgage bonds. It will then raise the pace by $10 billion every three months.
Mr. Alexander, and other analysts, see a number of factors likely to limit the impact on interest rates, at least in the short term. Both the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan continue to buy bonds, putting downward pressure on rates. And the Treasury is issuing less long-term debt at the moment, reducing the volume of new securities that markets must absorb.
It is also not clear how much shrinking the Fed plans to do. It needs to hold about $1.5 trillion in bonds to meet demand for currency, which it puts into circulation by purchasing bonds. That number is projected to nearly double over the next decade.
The Fed also needs to hold hundreds of billions of dollars in bonds to maintain its current system for controlling interest rates, which it adopted after the crisis.
Jerome H. Powell, a Fed governor, said earlier this year that the new system is working well and the balance sheet is unlikely to shrink much below $3 trillion.
But maintaining a large balance sheet also means the Fed would remain a more prominent presence in short-term funding markets, where it has displaced some private activity. William Nelson, chief economist at The Clearing House, a trade group representing large banks, said the Fed should return to its pre-crisis operating procedures, which required a much smaller balance sheet.
"The pre-crisis framework worked very well. The Fed had very good control of rates and economic activity," Mr. Nelson said. "Nobody was complaining that the Fed's control of interest rates pre-crisis was not precise enough."
Another open question is whether the Fed would buy bonds in responding to a future downturn. Fed officials predict the benchmark rate will not rise much above 3 percent. That's a problem because during the past nine recessions, the Fed has cut the rate by an average of 5.5 percentage points to stimulate the economy.
In a speech last year at the Fed's summer conference at Jackson Hole, Wyo., Ms. Yellen pointed to asset purchases and forward guidance as the Fed's fallback plan. Those tools, she said, "will remain important components of the Fed's policy tool kit."
But Mr. Trump could choose a Fed chairman who disagrees. Kevin Warsh, an adviser to Mr. Trump who is among the possible candidates, resigned as a Fed governor in 2011 in part because he opposed the Fed's second round of asset purchases.

Full text: In sharp contrast to the soaring health insurance premiums in many Affordable Care Act marketplaces, the cost of coverage for the vast numbers of people who get insurance through their jobs rose relatively little this year, continuing a period of remarkable stability in the employer market, according to a national survey released Tuesday. The annual premium for family coverage rose an average of 3 percent to $18,764 this year, according the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit group, which conducted the annual survey of employers. That is the sixth straight year that employer-provided policies have increased by well under 5 percent, according to the survey. Employers paid the bulk of the costs, the survey found, with workers shouldering an average of $5,714, a year for a family policy.
About 151 million people are covered through an employer, and the insurance environment for many of those companies is characterized by "a remarkable stubborn stability," said Craig Garthwaite, a health economist at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University.
The exception is the smallest companies, which are still finding it challenging to afford insurance for their workers. In recent years, a growing number of smaller companies have stopped providing health benefits, according to the Kaiser data. Over the last five years, the percentage of businesses with under 50 workers offering coverage has fallen from 59 percent to 50 percent. In 2001, two thirds of those employers offered benefits.
Health costs remain an issue even for families with stable employer coverage. This year's modest rise still outpaces both overall inflation and the increase in workers' earnings. "The sticker shock for people is still very real," said Drew Altman, the Kaiser foundation's chief executive.
But it is a calm environment compared to the marketplaces where individuals shop for coverage under the Affordable Care Act. While fewer than 20 million Americans buy their own insurance, the tribulations of the individual market have captured most of the public's attention. The average cost of a benchmark plan in the individual market rose 20 percent this year, according to Kaiser, as insurers tried to stem their losses.
The combination of political uncertainty over the future of the health law and insurer unrest may result in a similar jump in individual premiums for 2018. Insurers must make their final decisions where to sell and what to charge in the Affordable Care Act marketplaces by the end of the month.
Early results from another employer survey, conducted by Mercer, a benefits consultant, indicate that businesses expected to see health benefit costs increase 4.3 percent for 2018 after making changes like switching insurers or raising plan deductibles. "Our take away from this is that the trend for employers remains stable, and it remains low," said Tracy Watts, a senior partner at Mercer.
As a result, employers may not feel the need to make any drastic changes. "What I see in our renewals is very predictable and very steady," said Lisa Trombley, benefits manager for Kelly Services, the Troy, Mich., staffing company.
Overall, health care costs have increased at historically low rates in recent years, said Matthew Fiedler, a health economist at the Brookings Institution. "We've got lots of indicators, across a constellation, that the health care trend is pretty low," he said.
While employers credit their efforts to slow down costs, others, including Mr. Fiedler, say some of the changes enacted under the Affordable Care Act have also contributed. The federal law reduced what Medicare pays for care, which allows private payers to strike better bargains, he said, and the government has been encouraging experiments in how to pay doctors and hospitals in new ways that may reduce spending.
Even the deductibles people pay toward their own medical bills, which have gone up steadily in recent years, seem to be holding steady. Deductibles rose only slightly this year, averaging $1,505 for a single person, according to Kaiser.
While employers have relied on steeper deductibles to lower their own costs, companies are recognizing that they have reached the limits of what they can ask their workers to pay, said Michael Thompson, the chief executive of the National Alliance of Healthcare Purchaser Coalitions, which represents employers. "We're running out of runway to keep cost-shifting to employees," he said.
But people remain confused about how the turmoil in the individual market affects them, even when they get their coverage through an employer, Mr. Altman said. In a recent Kaiser poll, six out of 10 Americans worried that the higher rates being charged in the A.C.A. markets would negatively affect them, he said.
The two markets are distinct, and the groups of people being covered are "like night and day," Mr. Altman said. The individual market has a large portion of people who need expensive medical care, which has led to sharply higher prices some areas. The large employer market can spread the costs of expensive care more easily over the greater numbers of people that work for large companies.
Small businesses, however, can't spread their medical costs over a large work force. Premiums "have gone up double digits up here," said Martin Dole, the controller for Gateway Motors, a car dealership in White River Junction, Vt., which covers 28 people.
The family plan Gateway offers costs more than $700 a month and comes with a deductible of $9,500, which workers "hate," he said. Health care is one of the dealership's largest expenses, Mr. Dole said, and he is concerned that the dealership may not be able to afford to offer coverage in coming years.
Larger companies tend to view health benefits as a key component of compensation and essential to attracting employees. Companies and their workers also enjoy a generous tax subsidy for employer-sponsored coverage. While there has been some discussion about reducing or eliminating that subsidy, including as part of the push for a single-payer Medicare-for-all plan that would replace the current system with the one now providing coverage to people 65 and older, there seems to be significant support for maintaining the current system.
"It's pretty much business as usual," said Larry Boress, the chief executive of the Midwest Business Group on Health, a regional group of employers. Companies are holding down costs through a variety of efforts, like offering workplace clinics or more telehealth services so employees do not have to go to the doctor or show up in the emergency room.
Employers will continue to look for ways to reduce what they pay toward their workers' health care costs, he said. "Whether the A.C.A. exists or not, they will clearly do that," he said.

Europe takes aim at a piece of tech company profits.
The European Commission is expected to publish on Monday a list of options for taxing technology companies like Google and Amazon. These companies have been in the cross hairs of European officials because of their efforts to minimize the taxes they pay by recording profits in lower tax jurisdictions, like Luxembourg and Ireland. Last year, the European Commission ordered Ireland to collect $14.5 billion in unpaid taxes from Apple in a record penalty, saying that the company's deals with the Irish government had allowed it to pay virtually nothing on its European business in some years.

ECONOMY
Housing numbers get a baseline as uncertainty looms.
The housing market has been caught between two counteracting forces this year: a run of strong job growth that has lifted demand among home buyers, and a dearth of inventory that has kept many prospective home buyers finding nothing to buy. That has lead to seesaw numbers for a slew of housing data. Soon, the figures will get even harder to interpret, as the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, which pummeled the nation's largest new-housing market, affects the data. Housing starts, which come out on Tuesday, and existing home sales, which come out on Wednesday, shouldn't be affected by the storm just yet. So consider those numbers a baseline before volatility sets in over the next few months as rebuilding efforts get underway. Conor Dougherty
A sell-off seems certain, but the Fed will move slowly.
The Federal Reserve is widely expected to announce that it will begin to reduce its vast holdings of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities, an important step toward concluding its post-crisis economic stimulus campaign. The Fed's policy-making committee, which meets on Tuesday and Wednesday in Washington, is struggling to understand why inflation remains weak despite steady job growth and low unemployment. It is no longer clear whether the Fed will raise its benchmark interest rate again this year. But officials are sufficiently confident in the health of the economy to start whittling away at the $4 trillion bond portfolio, which was accumulated during the crisis to help hold down borrowing costs. The Fed plans to move slowly -- minimizing the impact on economic conditions -- initially reducing its holdings by just $10 billion a month. Binyamin Appelbaum
Nafta talks resume, with perhaps a sneak preview first.
United States trade negotiators travel to Ottawa next Saturday to begin the third round of negotiations with Canada and Mexico on the North American Free Trade Agreement. President Trump has said that he would like the deal to be finalized by the end of the year, but analysts say that may be a challenge. Some proposals by the United States, including one that would allow the agreement to expire after five years unless the three countries vote to continue it, have rankled Mexican and Canadian counterparts. The United States trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, who is the country's lead negotiator, may give some insight into the process as he outlines the administration's trade priorities in a speech on Monday.

A High-Priced Market, but Low-Grade Worries

Full text: Canny stock investors are like judges in a quirky beauty contest. They aren't looking for real beauty but for qualities that other people believe still other people will find beautiful. That was the observation of John Maynard Keynes, who suggested that investors do not actually make money by picking the best companies, but by picking stocks that waves of other traders will want to buy.
Investing, in other words, is an exercise in mass psychology.
I've spent decades studying it, and believe that one way to predict future market moves is to sort through the narratives that sweep through the population and influence decisions on whether to buy or sell. Such an analysis is a matter of art as much as science, however. Getting it right is crucial in the United States right now, because stock market valuations are already high enough to be worrisome.
But are investors primed psychologically for a major decline in the stock market, or are they likely to keep bidding up stocks for some time to come? Those are critical questions.
We can't peer into investors' minds, of course. But we can examine news articles for data on what they are reading. In a column in March, I noted that surveys indicate that people in the United States think the stock market is expensive. That would be dangerous if it meant that many investors were thinking of getting out of the market. But while I analyzed stock valuations, I didn't look at current stock market news coverage and compare it with the evidence from previous periods in which prices were also elevated. I'll remedy that now.
First, consider stock prices. They are very high, particularly when using the Cyclically Adjusted Price Earnings ratio, or C.A.P.E., which I defined almost thirty years ago with Prof. John Y. Campbell, who is now at Harvard University. The C.A.P.E. ratio is essentially the price earnings ratio, with annual fluctuations smoothed by averaging. (More precisely, it is the inflation-corrected stock price divided by the lagging ten-year average of real earnings.)
The C.A.P.E. ratio is above 30 today, compared with an average of 16.8 since 1881. It has been above 30 in only two other periods: in 1929, when it reached 33, and between 1997 and 2002, when it soared as high as 44.
The current number is troubling. After the ratio's peak in 1929, real inflation-corrected stock prices in the United States lost four-fifths of their value by 1932, the biggest crash in the market's history. And from 2000 to 2003, they lost half of their real value.
So current valuations make the market vulnerable. But it took more than high valuation numbers to precipitate those ugly declines in the past. The other ingredient was mass psychology. For information about what investors thought other investors were thinking, we can go to the newspaper archives.
First, in 1929, before the great October stock market crash, newspapers said prominently and repeatedly that traders were engaging in widespread speculative gambling. In an annual outlook piece on January 1, for example, The New York Times described "fantastic illusions" that were spurring "the most reckless stock market speculation." The article said it was possible that, before long, "the bubble bursts."
The notion that investors were laboring under "fantastic illusions" and had bid up prices to unsupportable levels appeared in many places. On the same day, The Atlanta Constitution ran a all-caps banner headline in its financial pages: "STOCK MARKET ACTIVITY AND PRICE FLUCTUATIONS SMASHED ALL RECORDS DURING YEAR JUST CLOSED."
The Proquest newspaper database shows an increasing concern that excessive lending to support share purchases was fueling stock speculation, starting in 1927, and peaking in 1929. The database also shows a sudden increase in 1928, and again in 1929, of references to "tulipomania" -- the bubble in tulip prices in Amsterdam that crashed in the 1630s. In 1928, the database shows, there was also a sudden burst in the use of the term "speculative orgy" in stock market articles.
Decades later, in the period leading to the dot-com crash that started in March 2000, we saw eerily similar themes in news articles. The term "tulipomania" began to spike again in the newspaper database, for example. And in a 1996 speech, Alan Greenspan raised the specter of "irrational exuberance,", a term that went viral by 2000 (I made it the title of a book on the markets that I published that year). When dot-com stock prices started to decline in 2000, people were already primed to rethink their assumptions about the wisdom of holding shares in internet companies.
In early 2000, for example, there was a surge in stories of foolish investors buying anything with ".com" in the company name. Dot-com investments morphed into embarrassing "dot-bombs," articles said, affecting the self-confidence of stock market investors and plausibly bleeding over to the whole market.
So where are we today?
Mass psychology appears to be in a different, calmer place. Investors do not seem to have the concern they had in 1929 or 2000 that other investors might suddenly sell their holdings and get out of the stock market.
That said, speculation based on excessive lending is a worry, the newspaper database indicates, but less so than in the previous periods. References to tulipomania have been appearing from time to time, but widespread fear that we might already be immersed in a speculative orgy is simply not evident. And while there have been articles this year about the boom in so-called FAANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google), the database indicates that this issue is minimal compared with the attention given in the late 1990s to the dangers of dot.com stocks.
In the financial sphere, discussions of bitcoin, the leading so-called cryptocurrency, have gone viral twice, in 2013 and again this year. There may well be a bitcoin bubble, but with a total market value for bitcoin that is still less than $100 billion dollars, potential problems within that world don't seem to provide investors with sufficient reason to consider bailing out of the vastly larger stock market. And articles about the outlook for the stock market on New Year's Day in 2017 contained barely a hint of the concerns about speculative mania that were so evident in 1929.
Why people are so calm about the high-priced market is a bit of a mystery. On this, I can only speculate. Perhaps investors have been distracted by the endless flow of news about Donald J. Trump, North Korea, the back-to-back hurricanes and so much else. I don't really know.
But the result is that while valuations remain very high there just doesn't seem to be much evidence that many investors in the United States stock market are actively worrying today that other investors are on the verge of selling. Mass opinions may well change, but for now, in the critical psychological dimension, the stock market does not closely resemble the market in the dangerous years of 1929 or 2000.
That doesn't mean that there is no danger of a crash. But at the moment, the psychological preconditions for a spiraling downturn don't appear to be in place.

Why the Pain Persists Even as Incomes Rise

Full text: Incomes are up. Poverty is down. And job openings have hit a record high. But if the economy is so wonderful, why are so many Americans still feeling left behind? The disconnect between positive statistics and people's day-to-day lives is one of the great economic and social puzzles of recent years. It helped fuel President Trump's political rise and underpins the frustrations that played out in calls to build a Mexican border wall, reopen trade agreements, and bring back well-paid work in coal mines and factories.
When the Census Bureau released its annual report on the country's economic well-being on Tuesday, it showed unmistakable progress: For the second year in a row, household incomes -- clobbered by the 2007 recession -- had grown. More Americans were working, and more had health insurance, in 2016 than the year before.
The findings suggest that the "American dream" -- in which each generation is richer and better positioned than the previous one -- is back on track.
For many Americans, though, the recent progress is still dwarfed by profound changes that have been building for nearly a half-century: rising inequality and rusted-stuck incomes.
"Over the past five decades, Middle America has been stagnant in terms of its economic growth," said Mark Rank, a professor of social work at Washington University in St. Louis. In 1973, the inflation-adjusted median income of men working full time was $54,030. In 2016, it was $51,640 -- roughly $2,400 lower. A big chunk of that group -- white working-class men -- formed a critical core of support for Mr. Trump, who spoke to their economic anxieties and promised changes in trade, immigration and tax policies as a solution.
As in an Agatha Christie mystery, the potential culprits behind the long-term trends are many -- global competition, technological advances, trade imbalances, a mismatch of skills, the tax system, housing prices, factory shutdowns, excessive regulation, Wall Street pressure, the erosion of labor unions and more. Most of the suspects, if not all, are likely to have played some role.
But the forces undermining the middle class may reach back farther than many economists have thought. The latest evidence comes from a group of researchers at universities and the Social Security Administration who have been tracking the earnings of hundreds of millions of individuals over their careers.
Starting with 1957, the team looked at actual earnings during the prime working years -- the ages of 25 to 55. For a while, it saw a clear pattern: Younger men could expect to make more over their lives than older ones. Every year the starting rewards were higher and kept growing. So men who turned 25 in, say, 1960 would end up with a higher median cumulative income by 55 than men who had turned 25 in 1959. And the '59ers would, in turn, do better over three decades than those who had turned 25 in 1958.
But that steady progress stopped in the late 1960s. Then, instead of increasing, lifetime earnings for men made an about-face and began to decline. They have been dropping pretty much ever since. The result was that a 25-year-old man who entered the work force in 1967 and worked for the next three decades earned as much as $250,000 more, after taking inflation into account, than a man who had the same type of career but was 15 years younger.
"That's enough to buy a medium-size house in the United States," said Fatih Guvenen, an economist at the University of Minnesota and a co-author of the study. "That is what you are missing from one generation to the next generation."
And the trend appears to be continuing. "Every new cohort made less in median lifetime income than the previous one," Mr. Guvenen said.
The result is widening lifetime inequality as well. That's because nearly all of the financial gains have been funneled to those at the top of the income scale. For four out of five men, there was no real growth.
"And it all starts at age 25," Mr. Guvenen said. The decline in lifetime earnings is largely a result of lower incomes at younger ages rather than at older ages, he said, and "that was very surprising to us."
Most younger men ended up with less because they started out earning less than their counterparts in previous years, and saw little growth in their early years. They entered the work force with lower wages and never caught up.
According to one conservative measure of inflation, in 1967, the median income at age 25 was $33,300; in 1983, it was $29,000. Twenty-five-year-olds did better during the 1990s, but then the slide returned. In 2011, the median income for 25-year-old men was less than $25,000 -- pretty much the same as it was in 1959.
The picture for women looks different because so many more of them started at a disadvantage: Few worked full time in the 1950s, and those who did earned below-average wages. As more women entered the work force over the decades, their lifetime earnings rose. But more recently, as the share of women working has leveled off, their lifetime income gains, too, have slowed.
The result is that, since the 1950s, three-quarters of working Americans have seen no change in lifetime income. Health and retirement benefits have made up some of the lost ground, but far from all of it.
The recent progress reported by the Census Bureau doesn't conflict with this story. As the bureau explained, the income gains came mostly because more people were working full time. Roughly 2.2 million more adults had full-time jobs in 2016 than in 2015.
To Mr. Guvenen, the research indicates that the political debates in Washington centered on earnings and employment have been too narrow. Given the early roots of lifetime income disparities, he said, more attention should be paid to what is going on even before people start entering the work force.
"Our findings suggest that both the stagnation of median lifetime income for men, and the increase in lifetime income inequality for men and women, can be traced to changes that newer cohorts have experienced before age 25," the research team concluded.
That would mean looking at policies directly related to the family and education.
Certainly the kinds of jobs and salaries that high school graduates used to be able to command have dived. "That's the single most important reason we're having so much trouble," said Ron Haskins, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. "You have to have better skills and more knowledge to make $60,000 to $80,000 a year now than in the past."
The shrinking rewards of a high school education help explain not only the stress that Americans in the work force are feeling, but also why a larger proportion of men have dropped out altogether during their prime working ages. Work doesn't pay off the way it used to.
That's a problem produced not just by the labor market, but also by the educational system, Mr. Haskins said. "We have a lot of people who are very difficult to educate and tend to drop out," he said. Minorities are especially vulnerable. Without changing that dynamic, he said, it is going to be difficult to halt the hollowing out of the middle class.

Full text: Stock markets continued their march higher Friday, with the Standard & Poor's 500 index passing the threshold of 2,500 for the first time in its 60-year history. Wall Street is riding the second-longest bull market in history, with investors repeatedly shrugging off domestic and international turmoil as they pile into shares of technology and other companies. On Friday, for example, the rally continued despite news that North Korea had launched its second missile in a month over Japan. Instead, the market focused on strong performances from tech stocks.
Standard & Poor's bellwether stocks index spent much of the day flirting with 2,500. In the final moments of the trading day, investors nudged the benchmark to 2,500.23, up nearly five points on the day. Other indexes, including the Dow Jones industrial average, also closed at record highs.
While the stock-buying spree continues, the market's upward march has left some investors nervous that a geopolitical crisis or a sudden bout of bad financial or economic news could spark a downturn.
"It doesn't appear to be alarmingly overvalued, but it's possible things have gone too far," said Paul Ashworth, chief United States economist at Capital Economics. "Though obviously that's hard to judge, because it's something we'll only realize in hindsight."
The S.&P. index has gained nearly 270 percent since March 2009, when the last bear market ended. A bull market is defined by a prolonged rally uninterrupted by any decline of 20 percent or more. The longest bull market lasted for roughly a decade between 1990 and 2000.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 22,268.34, rising 0.29 percent, or 64.86 points. The Nasdaq composite narrowly missed the record of 6,460.19 it set on Wednesday, closing up 0.30 percent, or 19.38 points, at 6,448.47.
Behind the recent rally are at least two trends. First, the technology sector has been on a tear, with investors racing to get a piece of companies that could become the next Apple or Google.
Among Friday's biggest winners was Nvidia, a chip maker in California. Its shares rose 6.3 percent, or $10.71, to $180.11 after its leadership in artificial-intelligence development was lauded in a client note from Evercore ISI.
Second, the extended period of ultralow interest rates has been a boon. The question is how long that will continue. Traders will closely monitor the Federal Reserve's meeting next week for any signs about its intentions. Inflation rose in August, increasing the likelihood that the Fed will lift rates by the end of the year.
Meanwhile, some investors are increasingly optimistic that Congress will enact some sort of tax reform, especially as President Trump courts support from Democrats. Such legislation has the potential to be a boon to corporate America and therefore to stocks.
"The good times should keep on rolling for a while," said Barry Sine, director of research at Drexel Hamilton. "This is going to head to 2,800 by year end."
Investors seemed to overlook recent economic indicators -- retail sales dipped 0.2 percent last month, and industrial output took its deepest dive in eight years -- in the belief that hurricanes had muddied the data.
"The initial impact of Harvey and Irma will be negative, but there's going to be a lot of economic activity -- a huge number of cars getting replaced, more building," Mr. Sine said. "And as that happens, we'll be going into the Christmas season."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text: It was a split decision on Wall Street on Thursday as stock gains in a handful of industrial and health care companies largely outweighed sluggishness elsewhere in the market, including the technology sector. Sizable gains by Boeing and United Technology were enough to push the Dow Jones industrial average to another record, but other major indexes fell.
Shares of retailers were also weak after the government said prices paid by consumers jumped in August. That could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner than expected to cool the economy and stave off inflation.
Energy company stocks rose as United States crude oil climbed to its highest price in six weeks.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slid 2.75 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,495.62. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 45.30 points, or 0.2 percent, to 22,203.48. It was the Dow's third straight record high close.
The Nasdaq composite slumped 31.10 points, or 0.5 percent, to 6,429.08 as shares of big names like Facebook and Alphabet, Google's parent company, lost ground.
The Labor Department reported that consumer prices grew 0.4 percent in August as gas and housing costs rose. Prices were up 1.9 percent compared with last year. That could show inflation is speeding up, though it was not clear how much of the recent increase in gas prices was because of Hurricane Harvey, which deluged the Gulf Coast region in late August and caused many drilling rigs and refineries to shut down.
The Federal Reserve will meet next week; investors were assessing whether Thursday's consumer-price report would make it more likely that the Fed would raise interest rates later in the year. Higher interest rates reduce growth because they make borrowing more expensive.
Michael Scanlon, a portfolio manager for Manulife Asset Management, said if inflation did get stronger over the next few months, "it would be a sign of more health in the economy over all."
Urban Outfitters stock fell 77 cents, or 3.3 percent, to $22.77 and shares of the discount retailer Ross Stores lost 81 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $60.60. Amazon shares shed $7.39 to $992.21. Coca-Cola stock lost 38 cents to $46.11 and shares of the grocery store operator Kroger fell 47 cents, or 2.2 percent, to $21.26.
Shares of the jewelry seller Tiffany dropped $4.56, or 4.8 percent, to $90.95 after one of the company's biggest shareholders, Qatar's investment fund, said it sold some of its Tiffany stock.
Boeing stock rose another $3.30, or 1.4 percent, to $245.23. Its chief executive, Dennis Muilenburg, said the company expected to start delivering more planes. The stock rose 0.6 percent a day ago. Other industrial companies also benefited. United Technologies shares gained $2.86, or 2.6 percent, to $113.14.
Benchmark United States crude oil rose 59 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $49.89 a barrel. That was its highest closing price since the end of July. Brent crude, used to price international oils, gained 31 cents to $55.47 barrel in London.
Among energy companies, Schlumberger stock rose 78 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $67.70 and Anadarko Petroleum shares picked up 40 cents to $43.53.
Shares of the chip maker Lattice Semiconductor slipped after the United States government stopped its sale to a firm backed by the Chinese government because of national security concerns. Lattice accepted the $1.02 billion offer from Canyon Bridge Partners in November, but investors have long been skeptical the deal would be completed. Last week a United States government panel said the sale should be blocked.
Lattice stock wobbled between gains and losses and finished 2 cents lower at $5.70. Canyon Bridge agreed to pay $8.30 a share.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was unchanged at 2.19 percent. The yield on the two-year note rose to 1.37 percent from 1.35 percent.
The dollar slid to 110.54 yen from 110.61 yen. The euro rose to $1.1903 from $1.1883. The pound jumped to $1.3399 from $1.3201.

The Economy Isn't Broken

Full text: Middle-class wage stagnation is the biggest economic fact driving American politics. Over the past many years, so the common argument goes, capitalism has developed structural flaws. Economic gains are not being shared fairly with the middle class. Wages have become decoupled from productivity. Even when the economy grows, everything goes to the rich. This account of reality, which I've certainly repeated, explains why the Democratic Party has moved from the Bill Clinton neoliberal center to the Bernie Sanders left. It explains why the Republicans have moved from the pro-market Mitt Romney right to the populist Donald Trump right.
On both left and right, movements have arisen to fix capitalism's supposed structural flaws, either by radically interfering in the marketplace (Bernie) or by clamping down on global competition (Trump).
But what if there are no structural flaws? What if the market is working more or less as it's supposed to?
That's certainly the evidence from the last two years. Over this time, the benefits of economic growth have been shared more widely.
In 2015, median household incomes rose by 5.2 percent. That was the fastest surge in percentage terms since the Census Bureau began keeping records in the 1960s. Women living alone saw their incomes rise by 8.7 percent. Median incomes for Hispanics rose by 6.1 percent. Immigrants' incomes, excluding naturalized citizens, jumped by over 10 percent.
The news was especially good for the poor. The share of overall income that went to the poorest fifth increased by 3 percent, while the share that went to the affluent groups did not change. In that year, the poverty rate fell by 1.2 percentage points, the steepest decline since 1999.
The numbers for 2016 have just been released by the Census Bureau, and the trends are pretty much the same. Median household income rose another 3.2 percent, after inflation, to its highest level ever. The poverty rate fell some more. The share of national income going to labor is now rising, while the share going to capital is falling.
In a well-functioning economy, workers are rewarded for their productivity. As output, jobs and hours worked rise, so does income. Over the past two years, that seems to be exactly what's happening.
The evidence from the past two years strongly supports those who have argued all along that income has not decoupled from productivity. A wide range of economists, including Martin Feldstein, Stephen Rose, Edward Lazear, Joao Paulo Pessoa, John Van Reenen, Richard Anderson of the St. Louis Fed and a team from Goldman Sachs, have produced studies showing wages tracking very predictably with productivity.
If anything, as Neil Irwin of The Times's Upshot has noted, wages are a little higher than you'd expect from looking at the productivity and inflation numbers alone.
The problem of the middle-class squeeze, in short, may not be with how the fruits of productivity are distributed, but the fact that there isn't much productivity growth at all. It's not that a rising tide doesn't lift all boats; it's that the tide is not rising fast enough.
For those interested, Shawn Sprague has a good summary of the data at the Labor Department's "Beyond the Numbers." He shows conclusively that during this recovery we've endured a historically low labor productivity growth rate of 1.1 percent. By some estimates if productivity increases had kept pace with the mid-20th-century norm, l median incomes would be $40,000 higher than they are today.
If productivity itself is the problem, not distribution, radically different politics is demanded than we're seeing today. If productivity is the problem, we need more dynamism, not less, more openness, not less, more growth-oriented policies, not more dirigiste and redistributive ones.
There are a few things government can do to help boost productivity: Increase market competition with more antitrust enforcement and fewer licensing regulations; admit more skilled immigrants; invest more in human capital; deregulate urban land usage back to the 2008 levels; introduce more market incentives into the low productivity sectors, like health care and education; fund more research into promising technologies like new energy storage systems.
Today politics is polarizing to the populist left and the populist right. But if productivity is the problem, what we actually need is a resurgence of the moderates. The moderate-left policies of Barack Obama must have had something to do with the middle-income gains of the last two years. Moderate Democrats can plausibly argue that government should not be interfering in the markets, but it should be addressing the inequalities that are the result of deeper social forces. There is still a yawning gap dividing the median Asian-American household, which makes $81,000 a year; the median white household, which makes $65,000; and the median African-American household, which makes $39,490.
Moderate Republicans can argue that while government should be active in boosting human capital, and in helping rural America, most of what's needed is more dynamic capitalism -- more trade, more immigration, more free competition, fewer regulatory burdens, more growth.
Right now moderates are in retreat. The populist extremes are on the march. But the fact is they are basing their economic and political agendas on a story that is fundamentally untrue.

What Trump Can Do to Prevent the Next Crash

Full text: The Federal Reserve arguably has more influence on the daily lives of Americans than any other government agency. In the coming year President Trump has a chance to appoint or replace five of the central bank's seven governors, including the vice chairman, Stanley Fischer, and possibly the chairwoman, Janet Yellen. Few presidents have had so many seats to fill this quickly, and it's time to pay attention to how Mr. Trump will use the opportunity. The heavy hitters vying for seats are talking -- often vaguely -- about reforming the Fed, which has been praised for preventing a depression after the financial crisis of 2008, but questioned for failing to anticipate the crisis itself.
The Fed missed the crisis in part because it has a dual mandate to keep unemployment and consumer price inflation low -- and both were low before 2008. Real reform would add a third mandate: maintaining financial stability, and in particular stabilizing prices for assets like houses and stocks, which are not counted as "consumer prices" but now have a bigger influence on the economy.
Consumer price inflation has largely disappeared, in part because central bankers have been fighting it effectively since the 1970s, and in part because heightened global competition began restraining prices for consumer goods from TVs to toys. Meanwhile, asset prices are getting pushed in the opposite direction.
To ease the Great Recession after 2008, central banks adopted zero to negative interest rates and provided huge amounts of cash, effectively giving investors free money. In a world with few barriers to the flow of capital across borders, this is spurring buying sprees, and thus bidding up prices for stocks, bonds and real estate in markets from New York to Shanghai.
Today, global financial assets (including just stocks and bonds) are worth over $250 trillion and amount to about 330 percent of global gross domestic product, up from $12 trillion and just 110 percent in 1980. Traditionally, economists have looked for trouble in the economy to cause trouble in the markets. But the ocean of money in financial markets is now so large, it's possible that ripples on its surface could trigger the next big downturn.
In the postwar era, finance has grown enormously as a share of the global economy, often feeding debt-fueled bubbles. In 2015, the economist Alan M. Taylor and his colleagues looked at data going back 140 years for 17 leading economies. Before World War II, there were 78 recessions -- including only 19 that followed a bubble in stocks or housing or both. After the war, there were 88 recessions, a vast majority of which, 62, followed a stock or housing bubble or both.
Since 1990, every major economic shock has been preceded by a collapse in prices for houses, stocks or both, including Japan's crash in 1990, the Asian crisis of the late 1990s, the dot-com crash of 2000-01, and the global financial crisis of 2008.
The Fed has changed with the world before. After the Great Depression, it focused on fighting unemployment. Amid crippling consumer price inflation in the 1970s, it shifted its focus to fighting this scourge. Now, amid looming market bubbles from China to Norway, central bankers are tentatively starting to recognize that they can't ignore asset price inflation. At the Federal Open Market Committee, its key policy-making body, financial stability rarely came up before 2012 but has come up at 27 of 39 meetings since.
Of course, even market insiders can't spot when asset prices are ready to crash, so skeptics say the Fed can't be expected to either. Better to let bubbles pop and "mop up" after. However, the painfully slow recovery from 2008 shows how ineffective mess-mopping can be: Losses after the crash tend to be much bigger than gains on the way up. The Fed need not try to predict the market's peak; it needs only to identify signals of crises, so that it can act early to forestall them, controlling asset price inflation by raising rates or reducing cash infusions into the economy.
Thanks to post-mortem research done since 2008, we know much more about these signals. The key is to be on alert when markets are rising much faster than the underlying economy. Normally, for example, home prices rise around 5 percent a year; the International Monetary Fund has found that rate more than doubles in pre-crisis periods.
At least equally telling is the pace of increase in debt. When asset prices collapse, the owners suffer instant pain. But when debt used to buy those assets collapses, the resulting defaults ripple through banks and become a drag on the economy. The longest and deepest recessions tend to follow real estate busts, because homes are almost always purchased on credit, and during booms, so many buyers are tempted to borrow excessively for that dream house.
Nonetheless most economists -- even conservative deficit hawks who worry about the Fed "blowing bubbles" -- still look mainly for economic threats to the financial markets, rather than the threat that overgrown markets pose.
They thus don't recognize fully that the world has changed, and the tail now wags the dog. Many mainstream economists still argue that the economy can't be overheating if consumer price inflation is quiet, and they want to keep rates lower for longer, hoping that easy money will stoke growth in the economy, and jobs, for the poor and the working class.
However, since 2008, easy money has produced an unusually weak economic recovery alongside an unusually long and strong run-up in prices for stocks, bonds and housing. The rich own the fattest share of these assets, so wealth inequality is increasing. In addition, easy money is fueling monopoly power by helping entrenched companies borrow.
Liberals who question the value of promoting monopolies and the superrich might also question their fondness for easy money. Instead, to stabilize financial markets, most favor upholding tough post-2008 regulations -- but regulation alone can't contain the ocean of money in financial assets. From Australia to Canada to Sweden, central banks are keeping rates low because consumer price inflation is weak, thus fueling housing bubbles. Regulatory attempts to contain those bubbles are failing.
Central bankers are starting to recognize that when loose monetary policy is driving up asset prices to potentially unstable levels, it sows the seeds of a recession and hurts everyone. But only a minority are prepared to lean against the wind now. Asset prices from stocks to real estate have never been this expensive simultaneously.
In general, government agencies, including the Fed, change their ways only after crises. The big threat is that the Fed will fully commit to preserving financial stability only after instability in the markets has triggered the next crisis. Mr. Trump should be looking for governors who are willing to commit now.

Full text: CORRECTION APPENDED. Pete V. Domenici, the former six-term Republican senator from New Mexico whose mastery of budget and tax issues and energy policy made him one of the Senate's most influential members, died on Wednesday in Albuquerque. He was 85.
Steve Bell, his longtime chief of staff, said the cause was complications of abdominal surgery. Mr. Domenici died at the University of New Mexico Hospital.
He had long struggled with frontotemporal lobar degeneration, a progressive disease of the brain that causes forms of dementia. He announced in October 2007 that he would not seek a seventh term because of the disease. During his last full year in office, 2008, he often appeared visibly weakened in public appearances.
In 1972, Mr. Domenici (pronounced doe-MEN-ih-chee), a strong supporter of nuclear power in his home state, the site of the first atomic explosion, became the first Republican elected to the Senate from New Mexico in 38 years.
But he was little known nationally until 1981, when he was named chairman of the powerful Budget Committee in the wake of the Republican takeover of the Senate and Ronald Reagan's landslide victory over President Jimmy Carter in the 1980 election.
A fiscal conservative, Mr. Domenici set out to help fulfill Reagan's election-year promise to balance the federal budget. But it was a goal he would not achieve, as the federal deficit ballooned during the Reagan years.
Mr. Domenici supported the conservative theory that tax cuts stimulate economic growth. But he went on to grapple with the president himself, as well as with Republican colleagues in the Senate, on the long-term fiscal consequences of the White House's proposed tax cuts and increases in military spending, questioning whether they might spur inflation and defeat any chances of balancing the budget.
Congress passed steep tax cuts in 1981, and critics of the legislation said the reductions only deepened the federal deficit and fueled a subsequent recession. Reagan agreed to a huge tax increase in 1982 to reduce the deficit, and the economy began to rebound.
Mr. Domenici also sparred with Democrats over their counterproposals to increase Social Security benefits and expand other entitlement programs.
In fiercely partisan and ideological budget debates during the 1980s, he was lauded for his steadiness and credibility in helping to draw the opposing sides together to reach budget agreements and enact them into law.
It was not until the boom years of the 1990s that Mr. Domenici, in concert with a Democratic White House under Bill Clinton, succeeded in writing two balanced-budget agreements, the first in more than four decades. In doing so he clashed with the House speaker, Newt Gingrich, a Republican, calling Mr. Gingrich's proposed tax cuts under his "Contract With America" agenda fiscally irresponsible.
His bipartisanship made him one of the most respected members of the Senate. "Mr. Domenici enjoys a universal reputation as one of the Senate's hardest-working, most intelligent and most intense members," The New York Times said in an editorial in May 1995.
In a documentary film about Mr. Domenici made by a New Mexico PBS station, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, said: "There's no one in the Senate, or in the House of Representatives, that can make the case like Pete Domenici can, and make it as convincingly and as powerfully as he does. And whenever he does, the U.S. Senate just responds overwhelmingly."
Mr. Domenici spent four years as chairman of the Senate Committee on Energy after the 2002 midterm elections. He was regarded as Capitol Hill's foremost authority on nuclear power and a friend to the industries that supplied and used nuclear generating equipment.
Besides being the site of the first atomic explosion, in a test in 1945 at Alamogordo, New Mexico is home to two national laboratories, an underground atomic-waste repository and a privately owned uranium enrichment plant. A network of government and private nuclear installations employs more than 20,000 state residents. Scientists at Los Alamos called Mr. Domenici "St. Pete" for his ability to direct federal funding their way.
He also exerted influence on the Appropriations and Indian Affairs committees, helping to earmark funds for the settlement of Indian water disputes and land claims. And he pushed for giving mental health parity in health insurance coverage, a matter that affected him personally: One of his eight children had schizophrenia.
That cause was embraced by the Senate in 2008 when it passed mental health legislation as part of the Troubled Asset Relief Program, known as TARP, which steered billions of dollars to banks, insurance companies and automobile makers during the financial crisis of the late 2000s.
When he left office in January 2009, after 36 years on Capitol Hill, Mr. Domenici had become the longest-serving senator in New Mexico history. He was succeeded by Representative Tom Udall, a Democrat and a son of Stewart Udall, a former congressman from Arizona and the interior secretary in the Kennedy and Johnson administrations.
Mr. Domenici's near-spotless political career was blemished in 2008 when the Senate Ethics Committee admonished him for creating an "appearance of impropriety" by telephoning David Iglesias, a top federal prosecutor in New Mexico, at home shortly before the 2006 midterm elections.
Mr. Domenici's call, in which he asked about an impending indictment, was made only weeks before the Department of Justice, in December, dismissed eight United States attorneys, including Mr. Iglesias, a move that congressional Democrats said was a political purge by the Republican administration of President George W. Bush.
Mr. Domenici publicly apologized for making the call, which he said had not been meant to pressure the prosecutor. The Ethics Committee appeared to support that assertion, saying it found no "substantial evidence" that Mr. Domenici had "attempted to improperly influence an ongoing investigation."
Pietro Vichi Domenici was born in Albuquerque on May 7, 1932. He was the youngest of six children and the only son of Cherabino Domenici (who was known as Choppo) and the former Alda Vichi. His parents, who were both immigrants from northern Italy, ran a successful grocery business, where their children helped out.
Mr. Domenici later resisted his party's hard-line policy on border protection and immigration policy, in part because of an experience he had as a young man during World War II, when he witnessed his mother, an undocumented immigrant, being arrested at home, taken away in a black car and then briefly detained by the authorities, who were looking for Italian sympathizers. His father had become a citizen after serving in the Army in World War I.
Mr. Domenici attended the University of New Mexico, where he was a star pitcher on the baseball team, and graduated with a degree in education in 1954. He spent a year teaching junior high school science and math and then attended the Denver University law school, earning his degree in 1958. He married Nancy Burk, a physical therapist, that same year.
He entered politics in 1966, when he was elected to the Albuquerque City Commission. By then he had legally changed his given name to Pete. He ran for governor of New Mexico in 1970, winning the Republican nomination but losing to his Democratic rival, Bruce King. Two years later, he won his Senate seat handily.
In 2013, Mr. Domenici's upright image was tarnished when it was revealed that he had fathered a child in the 1970s with Michelle Laxalt, whose father was Senator Paul Laxalt, Republican of Nevada. Mr. Domenici was 46 and Ms. Laxalt was 24 at the time of their relationship.
He and Ms. Laxalt disclosed the affair, they said, because they believed someone else was about to do so. Their son, Adam Laxalt, has been Nevada's attorney general since 2015.
Besides his son Pete Jr. and Mr. Laxalt, Mr. Domenici's survivors include his wife and their seven other children -- Lisa, Nella, Claire, David, Nanette, Paula and Helen -- as well as 15 grandchildren, three great-grandchildren and two sisters.
In 2004 Senator Domenici wrote a book on the signature issue of his career, whose title made clear where he stood: "A Brighter Tomorrow: Fulfilling the Promise of Nuclear Energy."
"In the 21st century," he wrote, "nuclear power will be a major contributor to global peace and a better quality of life for both the developed and developing world.
"My ultimate goal is that in the year 2045, 100 years after the detonation of the first atomic bomb and the birth of the nuclear age, the world will evaluate the role played by nuclear technologies and conclude that their overall impact was strongly positive."
Correction: September 15, 2017, Friday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An obituary on Thursday about the former New Mexico senator Pete V. Domenici, using information from a spokesman, misstated the number of great-grandchildren who survive him. There are three, not two.

Full text: President Trump clearly inherited an economy on the upswing, according to the 2016 Census report, with income, health coverage and poverty levels having all improved in the past two years. The question is whether his administration and the Republican-controlled Congress will sustain the momentum, or even reverse it.
The Census report, released on Tuesday, showed median income, adjusted for inflation, grew by 3.2 percent from 2015 to 2106, to $59,039, as employers added jobs and hours and even, in some cases, gave raises. At the same time, the poverty rate decreased by 0.8 percentage points, or 2.5 million people, to 12.7 percent. Both measures are now at or near their prerecession levels in 2007, a hard-fought recovery.
On health care, the data show that the ranks of the uninsured fell last year by 900,000 people, to an all-time low of 8.8 percent of the population. The decline is a result of the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. The 32 states and District of Columbia that participate in the A.C.A.'s expansion of Medicaid for low-income families had larger declines in their uninsured populations than states that do not participate. Massachusetts, for example, a pioneer in broad coverage, has the lowest uninsured rate in the nation, 2.5 percent, while Texas, which rejected Medicaid expansion, has the highest, 16.6 percent.
The data also show the success of federal safety-net programs. If not for tax credits for low-income workers, an additional 8.2 million people would have been classified as poor last year. Similarly, food stamps and low-income housing aid lifted 3.6 million and 3.1 million people, respectively, out of poverty last year.
For all the improvement, however, broad prosperity remains elusive. For income gains to meaningfully raise living standards, they would have had to exceed the peak from before the recession, not merely met it. One in eight Americans, 40.6 million people, are still poor. Some 28.1 million are still without health coverage.
And yet, Republican policy makers seem determined to undo the progress that has been made. The Trump administration has opposed Obama-era rules to update the nation's overtime-pay protections for salaried workers, arguably the single most important policy option to raise middle-class pay. President Trump and the House Budget Committee have both issued budget proposals for 2018 that call for deep spending cuts to safety-net programs. This week, the Republican senators Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina plan to introduce yet another draconian bill to end Obamacare.
Those giant steps backward would all shift income up the economic ladder. They would also create fiscal room for big tax cuts for the rich, a grail of Republican policy, despite the poor job and wage growth after the tax cuts of the George W. Bush era.
The result would be greater income inequality, the one measure that did not improve in the new Census data. Income gains at the top far outstripped those at the bottom.
Republicans' policies would undermine the gains of average Americans. Incompetence and public opposition have limited their success so far. They will not give up, though, so neither can the opposition.

Full text: Stocks rose to record highs Tuesday in the United States as banks kept rising and retailers climbed after some encouraging job data. It was the second straight day for big gains in bank stocks as bond yields pushed higher, which allows banks to charge higher rates on loans. Retailers rose after the Labor Department said job openings and hiring both grew in July, and more people quit their jobs to take new ones. That left investors hopeful people will shop and spend more.
The chemicals company DowDuPont climbed after making changes to its breakup plans, something activist investors had pushed for. Apple's newest iPhones did not generate much excitement on Wall Street.
The bond market is "moving back to a comfort zone," said Matt Toms, the chief investment officer for Voya Investment Management's fixed-income business. "Just enough growth, just enough inflation, but not too much of either."
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 8.37 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,496.48. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 61.49 points, or 0.3 percent, to 22,118.86. The Nasdaq composite index picked up 22.02 points, or 0.3 percent, to 6,454.28.
The S.&P. 500 finished at a record Monday and the Dow finished a fraction of a point above the record it set in early August. The Nasdaq surpassed the record it set on Sept. 1.
Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.17 percent after it jumped to 2.13 percent Monday. That helped banks. Bank of America added 59 cents, or 2.5 percent, to $23.95, while Citizens Financial Group gained $1.02, or 3 percent, to $34.48. Companies that pay big dividends like utilities and real estate investment trusts did not do as well as the rest of the market, as income-seeking investors were drawn to bonds.
Stocks were coming off their best day since late April. They rose Monday as Hurricane Irma weakened without doing as much damage as some forecasts had predicted last week. Investors were also relieved that tensions between the United States and North Korea did not get any worse following a national holiday there.
DowDuPont, which was formed when two of the world's largest chemical companies combined in August, made some changes to its breakup plan after pressure from activist investors.
DowDuPont gained $1.67, or 2.5 percent, to $68.52.
Job openings posted by employers rose 0.9 percent to 6.2 million in July, the Labor Department said. That is the highest on records dating to 2000. Hiring also increased and more people quit their jobs, which often means they are leaving for jobs that pay better. That helped smaller, domestically focused companies and retailers. Gap jumped $1.67, or 6.4 percent, to $27.61, and Victoria's Secret parent L Brands advanced $1.46, or 3.9 percent, to $39.36.
Apple's stock gyrated as the company announced its newest iPhones and updates to other products. The new iPhone 8 will be able to shoot pictures with better colors and less distortion, particularly in low-light settings, and it will be out Sept. 22. The iPhone X has an edge-to-edge screen and can be unlocked with facial recognition, but will not go on sale until Nov. 3.
The iPhone is the source of most of Apple's revenue, and some investors have been worried that supply constraints will slow down its sales. Apple was down early in the day, climbed as much as 1.5 percent as it made its announcements, and then wound up with a loss of 64 cents to $160.86.
Energy companies traded higher as benchmark United States crude added 16 cents to $48.23 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the standard for international oil prices, gained 43 cents to $54.27 a barrel in London.
Gold lost $3 to $1,328.00 an ounce. Silver dipped 1 cent to $17.89 an ounce. Copper fell 3 cents to $3.04 a pound.
The dollar rose to 110.19 yen from 109.46 yen. The euro edged up to $1.1966 from $1.1952. The British pound climbed to $1.3282 from $1.3165, its highest level in a year. That move came after inflation figures came in stronger than analysts expected, which left investors thinking the Bank of England may raise interest rates sooner than they had anticipated.

Incomes Jump, Adding Twist To Tax Battle

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Despite eight years of economic growth since a brutal recession, some politicians and economists have worried that many Americans have not felt the benefits of the expansion. On Tuesday, the Census Bureau painted a brighter picture, suggesting that the recovery had shifted into a new phase in recent years and is now distributing its benefits more broadly.
American households saw strong income growth last year, the bureau reported, and the gains stretched across the economic spectrum. A closely watched measure, median household income, jumped for the second straight year, reaching $59,039 -- a 3.2 percent increase after inflation.
The bureau also reported that the percentage of Americans living in poverty continued to fall last year, while the share with health insurance continued to increase.
The data may sharpen the political confrontation between President Trump, who is pressing to overhaul the nation's economic policies, and Democrats, who now have more ammunition to argue that the changes Mr. Trump seeks would mess with success.
Mr. Trump campaigned on a pledge to lift the nation's fortunes and to repair what he described in his inaugural address as "this American carnage." He has called for cuts to federal taxes and spending, broad reductions in regulation and limits on foreign trade.
The focus for now is on tax cuts. "Our painful tax system has become a massive barrier to America's economic comeback," Mr. Trump said last week in North Dakota. He dined Tuesday night with senators from both parties, seeking to build bipartisan support.
But some Democrats said the Census Bureau's new figures reinforced their determination to resist.
"We need to be building on the success of the past eight years, not abandoning the progress we have made as a country and the American people who worked so hard to get us there," said Representative John Yarmuth, a Kentucky Democrat who is the ranking member of the House Budget Committee.
The Federal Reserve is also closely watching the health of the economy as it debates how soon to resume hiking its benchmark interest rate.
Household incomes are outpacing wage growth because millions of Americans have returned to the work force, a vivid illustration of the old maxim that a job is the best antipoverty program. The economy added roughly 2.2 million jobs last year and an additional 1.4 million in the first eight months of this year.
The Census Bureau report is the second in a row to find strong income growth. A year ago, the bureau reported that the median income in 2015 had risen by 5.2 percent, the largest jump since record keeping began in 1967. The 2016 gains described on Tuesday pushed the median to the highest level on record, topping the previous peak in 1999.
But Census Bureau officials cautioned that those figures were not directly comparable because of a change in its methodology in 2013 that has tended to increase measured incomes.
The Economic Policy Institute, a liberal research organization based in Washington, estimated that without the change in methodology, median household income in 2016 was still 2.4 percent lower than in 1999 -- and 1.6 percent below the level reached in 2007, before the recession began.
The Census Bureau report also pointed out continuing challenges, including income inequality. The average household income for the poorest fifth of households fell by $571 over the decade that ended last year, adjusting for inflation. Over the same period, the average income for the wealthiest fifth of households rose by $13,479, adjusting for inflation.
Racial disparities also have increased. The bureau reported that the median income for African-American households has fallen by 1.6 percent since 1999. The adjusted numbers provided by the Economic Policy Institute pegged the drop at 7.5 percent.
The annual report is based on a survey of 95,000 households.
"Just as in 2015, 2016 is going on record as another year of massive income inequality," said Mary Coleman, senior vice president at Economic Mobility Pathways, a Boston nonprofit group that focuses on female and family poverty. "There was no meaningful reduction in income inequality."
The good news is that income inequality, by some measures, is no longer increasing.
The details of the report help to explain the reasons. Household incomes increased because more people were working, and the gains in employment have been concentrated among workers with less education, driving income gains on the lower rungs of the economic ladder.
"Households are doing better because more people are working and more people are working full time," said Jed Kolko, chief economist at the jobs site Indeed.com.
But the increases in household income also reflected investment gains. The share of income that came from sources other than wages increased markedly last year, to 21.8 percent, from 21.1 percent in 2015. That kind of income flows mostly to households on the upper rungs of the ladder.
Income inequality is at a very high level by historical standards. Some economists see evidence that the uneven distribution of income and wealth is an impediment to economic growth.
It also means the lives of Americans are increasingly different, depending on their economic fortunes. For example, mortality rates are climbing for middle-aged white Americans with no more than a high school education, a trend that the Fed chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, described this year as "very shocking."
The Fed has curtailed its efforts to stimulate economic growth, concluding that monetary policy has done what it can. The Fed is expected to announce next week, after a meeting of its policy-making committee, that it will begin to reduce its bond holdings, a final legacy of its stimulus campaign.
While the distribution of income didn't change last year, the rising tide lifted more people from poverty. The Census Bureau reported that 12.7 percent of households lived in poverty in 2016, representing a total of 40.6 million people. That was down from 13.5 percent of households and 43.1 million people in 2015. But the rate remains slightly higher than the 12.5 percent rate in 2007, before the recession, and significantly higher than the 11.3 percent rate in 2000.
"The challenge for policy makers now is to build on the last few years' progress and not worsen poverty and inequality," said Robert Greenstein of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank.
The data also showed that the ranks of those with health insurance coverage continued to grow last year. Only 8.8 percent of the population lacked insurance for the full year, down from 9.1 percent in 2015.
Montana and Louisiana expanded their Medicaid programs in 2016, joining 29 other states in accepting increased federal financing under the Affordable Care Act. Private coverage also increased as companies hired more workers and offered better benefits.

Full text: BEIJING -- For those who worry about the state of the world economy, China has long been a major reason to lose sleep. Its financial system labors under a mountain of loans, while weaker growth has prompted many Chinese people and companies to move their money overseas in recent years. China still faces hefty debt and slowing growth. But even some vocal naysayers say the country has found ways to contain its problems -- at least for now.
That improving outlook is, in part, reflected in China's currency. The renminbi has surged in value in recent weeks, helped by growing confidence in the country's economic prospects and by a political push for stability.
On Monday, Beijing set the currency's value at its strongest level in nearly a year and a half. While China keeps a firm grip on its value, investor interest in the renminbi helps strengthen it.
Other signs point to China steadying its course after a stock market crash and surprise currency devaluation two years ago shook the financial world and brought the country's long-term problems to the fore. China's economic data suggest growth is continuing at a steady, if less heady, pace. Its stock market is rising again.
China has not solved its problems, of course. But investors and economists say its efforts to keep the economy under control have restored some faith in the country's economic stewardship. In a sign of the government's own confidence, it eliminated two policies over the weekend that made it more expensive for investors to bet that the renminbi would weaken, measures adopted after money began to leave the country two years ago.
"Maybe China is the black swan and everything we know does not apply to China," said Zhu Ning, a Tsinghua University economist who published a book last year critical of how the government has managed rising bank debt.
In terms of his earlier worries about China's debt, he added, "I'm having doubts about what I believed as well."
The currency, which is one of the main ways the government controls the economy, is a gauge of the country's health and a source of tension for the United States and other trading partners. As the economy boomed, the renminbi largely strengthened. When growth faltered in recent years, money flooded out of the country, putting pressure on the currency.
The currency's ups and downs play to the debt concerns.
China relied on a huge wave of lending to power its economy in the aftermath of the global financial crisis nearly a decade ago. While the strategy worked, it pushed China to similar debt levels, relative to the size of its economy, as the United States and other developed countries.
It did so in an extremely short amount of time, ringing alarm bells in Wall Street and elsewhere. As recently as May, Moody's Investors Service, a ratings firm, lowered its credit rating on the country's debt, saying China's spending spree would hurt long-term growth. The currency devaluation and market crash in 2015 also lessened confidence in Beijing.
Since then, the authorities have taken a number of steps that appear to be keeping the short-term problems at bay, though doing little for the longer term.
Beijing has strictly limited how much money can be sent abroad and has clamped down on what a growing number of the country's leaders considered wasteful corporate purchases. The government has even resorted to strategies like face recognition software at automated teller machines in Macau, a Chinese-controlled territory and gambling mecca that has its own, more readily convertible, currency and that has long had a reputation for money laundering.
The government has also kept lending from sources it trusts, like the country's state-run banks. The push has been strong enough to maintain growth, even as officials have cracked down on other types of lending that they see as potentially disruptive. The stock market has begun to recover from its rout two years ago as rising real estate prices reassure investors about the health of China's developers, and resilient economic growth suggests that corporate profits may rise.
Charlene Chu, a China analyst at Autonomous Research, a global company advising hedge funds and other international money managers, has long worried that China's debt accumulation was becoming unsustainable. Now, she said, Beijing has the ability to postpone its problems.
"What I appreciate now is there are just no independent actors here," Ms. Chu said. "There is no bank that is going to say in November that 'our economic outlook is not good -- we're going to contract our loan book.' They can muddle on for a while."
But Ms. Chu and others see Beijing's efforts as stopgaps: If it does not address its debt, China risks a long period of low growth, as in Japan. Some economic indicators suggest that China's growth will begin to slow in the second half of this year.
But China's surging currency suggests investors are not as worried as before. While China keeps a tight grip on the value of its currency, it allows the renminbi to move up or down by a certain amount in its local currency market.
After falling to almost 7 to the dollar at the end of last year, the renminbi has rebounded. On Monday morning, China's central bank set the currency slightly stronger than 6.5 to the dollar for the first time since May 2016.
"The market has turned around significantly its bearish view" on the Chinese currency, said Zhou Hao, an economist in the Singapore office of Commerzbank.
The currency's rally is partly political. China is preparing for a twice-a-decade Communist Party Congress to begin in Beijing on Oct. 18. President Xi Jinping has made clear that he wants stability until then in practically every aspect of the country's life, including the economy.
Other currency moves -- particularly the United States dollar -- are contributing to the renminbi's strength. The dollar has weakened as the Federal Reserve has been slow to raise rates because the American economy has grown a little less vigorously than anticipated and as inflation in particular has fallen short of expectations.
In Europe, which is finally recovering from the global economic crisis, the euro has staged a powerful rally against the dollar over the past year. So while the renminbi has strengthened against the dollar, it has weakened against the euro. That blunts the impact of a stronger currency in Chinese factories when they export goods, as a strong currency makes them less competitive.
China can win some political gains from its stronger currency. President Trump, who has long criticized China's economic policies, has accused Beijing of keeping its currency artificially weak -- an accusation that had been true in the past but is not today. It could also ease its limit on money outflows, if it chooses.
"If the dollar is depreciating, China has a lot of easy policy options," said Brad W. Setser, a former deputy assistant secretary of the United States Treasury who is now a China specialist at the Council on Foreign Relations.
Mr. Zhu, of Tsinghua University, said he believed that the Chinese government could continue to postpone its problems. But he warned against complacency, saying China's debt could cause problems if it were not watched carefully.
"When will the bubble burst?" he said. "When nobody believes it's a bubble."

Full text: ASTANA, Kazakhstan -- By day, the huge and gleaming sphere looks like the spaceship of aliens who may not have come in peace. At night, it blinks out a playful pattern of colors and boosterish slogans on its high-tech outer skin -- a few parts light show, a few parts bumper sticker. Known officially as the Nur Alem, the imposing silver globe is the symbol and centerpiece of Kazakhstan's latest attempt at an "Open For Business" sign. Five years ago, the country won the rights to stage what is essentially the world's largest science fair. More than 100 nations built pavilions on a once-empty corner of this capital city. The Kazakh government chipped in a reported $3 billion, and, after an 11th-hour, all-hands push, met a June 10 deadline to open Expo 2017.
The theme of the fair, which closes on Sunday, is "Future Energy." That may sound like a stab at humor given that oil, gas and metals are the lifeblood of the country. But guided by the hand of Nursultan Nazarbayev, the first and, so far, only president of this former Soviet Republic, Kazakhstan is trying for a dramatic economic makeover.
The country does not want to merely sell off state-owned assets. The goal is to wean the nation from a dependence on natural resources and to transform it into a financial hub, the Dubai of Central Asia. There are plans for a new stock exchange overseen by an independent judicial system. Tech start-ups will get the come-hither, too, with the hope of giving rise to Kazakhstan's own version of Silicon Valley.
All of this will take foreign investors, and not enough of them have reached for their checkbooks yet. As a share of the country's gross domestic product, net foreign investment has dropped to 3.5 percent, from a high of 13 percent in 2004, the World Bank reports.
Experts say that, despite talk of reform and transparency, Kazakhstan is still quietly controlled by shifting alliances among elites, all of them angling for prestige and riches in a soap opera scripted by the president. "You have to carefully assess who your Kazakh partners are and where they fit into the elite structure," said Livia Paggi, a director at GPW, a political risk firm. "They can be bright and well connected, but if they fall out of political favor and lose their status, your business is at serious risk. In the worst case scenario, your asset could be seized."
When Mr. Nazarbayev, 77, isn't refereeing the never-ending tournament of clans, he is the nation's stern and loving grandfather, a ruler whose style might be described as autocrat lite. He has many of the trappings of an old-school authoritarian, including a self-mythologizing museum, a spotty record on human rights and a glaring absence of genuine political opposition. The last time he ran for re-election, in 2015, he won 98 percent of the vote -- a figure so high that he apologized the next day.
"But I could do nothing," he said, during an Orwellian press conference at the time. "If I had intervened, I would have looked undemocratic, right?"
Nonetheless, Mr. Nazarbayev has devoted much of his political life to expanding Kazakhstan's middle class, which has grown from just 9 percent of the population in the mid-2000s to 33 percent in 2014, according to the World Bank. To his people and to investors, he offers both opportunity and stability -- at least for now. He has never articulated a plan of succession, a pressing matter given what the actuarial tables would say about a man who toiled for years as a steelworker in Ukraine, breathing dust and gas near a blast furnace.
Then there is Kazakhstan's branding problem. Although it is wedged between China and Russia and has a land mass roughly four times the state of Texas, few outside the commodities business could pin it on a map. It is forever lumped with the other "stans" in the neighborhood, which are repressive by comparison. Kazakhstan's big international breakout moment came as the butt of jokes by comedian Sacha Baron Cohen, who played Borat, a bigoted and clueless Kazakh, in a 2006 mockumentary.
Expo 2017 is a splashy attempt to change that image. Kazakhstan beat out Belgium for the rights to host the "specialized expo," essentially a slightly scaled-down world's fair. Most of the visitors are tourists, but the key audience here are business executives, government leaders and anyone else who could sink real money into a country that is eager to diversify.
Much is riding on the event. Too much, perhaps, given that it is in a city as remote and singular as Astana and devoted to a subject as bland as "future energy." How many Westerners packed up their families and said, "Let's fly to Kazakhstan and learn about biomass fuel"?
Very few, judging from three days spent walking the grounds not long ago.
Multimedia Infomercials
Most people enter Expo through the Mega Silk Way, a 1.5 million-square-foot mall. It is filled with Kazakhstan's answers to Western staples: a restaurant that looks like Applebee's, a computer retailer that resembles an Apple store. Anyone yearning for local flavor can dine at Rumi, with traditional decorations on the walls and horse meat on the menu.
The fairgrounds look pristine, and touring the premises is like strolling through an updated United Nations as reimagined by a big box retailer. Many countries used their pavilions for elaborate, multimedia infomercials. Vietnam promoted its economy, Georgia extolled its wine and Belarus went for a hard-core real estate spiel, pitching a huge industrial park it is building with the Chinese.
In an effort to appear environmentally minded, Saudi Arabia showed a film on an IMAX-size screen with a montage that included men drinking bottled water and the words, "We sustain." Thailand highlighted the energy uses of animal waste, with the life-size rear end of an animatronic elephant, complete with a waggling tail, hovering over a convincing reproduction of a large dung patty.
"No step," an unnecessary sign nearby said.
For sheer production values, Russia's pavilion was hard to beat, although it was essentially a long claim to the rights to mine natural resources in the Arctic -- something that seemed wildly tin-eared in this setting. The country even displayed a block of "old arctic ice," which, after watching films of melting floes all over Expo, made you want to yell, "Put it back!"
The true ambitions behind Expo will only become apparent after it ends. The plan is to transform several of the buildings into Kazakhstan's Wall Street. The main attraction of the Astana International Financial Centre will be a stock exchange, created in partnership with Nasdaq, and a legal center for addressing financial disputes, to be governed by British common law.
The financial center goes beyond what has been tried here before. But Kazakhstan already has a stock exchange, and it has talked about selling off a greater share of state-owned assets in the past. To foreign investors, this new plan sounds very familiar. What has changed, government officials say, is the context.
"When the price of oil was $100 a barrel, it was difficult to convince anyone to think another way," said Kairat Kelimbetov, governor of the financial center. "The price of oil is $50 a barrel, and we don't think it is ever coming back. Now is the time to wake up."
For years, Kazakhstan had a terrible case of the resource curse, Mr. Kelimbetov said, referring to the paradoxical plague of the easy money that can come to any country with fortunes that are simply buried in the ground. But the curse is over here, and so far, that has brought only new curses.
After growing for years, Kazakhstan's middle class is shrinking, and the poverty rate has inched close to 20 percent, up from 16 percent in 2014, a World Bank report says. Average monthly wages, which now equal about $421, have fallen slightly for two years straight.
A series of sudden drops in the value of the Kazakh currency, the tenge, helped drive the inflation rate to 14 percent last year and added to the pain. The worst of the drops occurred in 2015, after the country's central bank introduced a free floating exchange rate. The tenge fell 25 percent against the dollar in a single day.
For an economy that soared by 13 percent soon after the turn of the century, the 1 percent rise in G.D.P. last year was a dismal comedown. The problem is that Kazakhstan remains addicted to oil and gas, which now account for nearly 60 percent of all exported goods and services. Sanctions against Russia, which has long been Kazakhstan's main trading partner, have hurt too.
The country has hired advisers, including Tony Blair Associates, the consulting firm led by the former British prime minister, to reform its economy and make it more welcoming to Western investors. On paper, the efforts have paid off: The country rose 16 spots, to 35th in world, in one year on the World Bank's annual Ease of Doing Business rankings.
Other lists are less flattering to Kazakhstan: It tied with Russia for 131st on Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index. The problem goes well beyond perceptions, as Expo 2017 itself demonstrated. The man initially in charge of the project, Talgat Ermegiyayev, was arrested in 2015, and then tried and convicted of embezzlement. The case startled the public, in part because Mr. Ermegiyayev's family had a long personal relationship and business ties to the president and his children.
The case looked, to all the world, like a crackdown, and proof that Mr. Nazarbayev would no longer tolerate impropriety, even by insiders. But little about Kazakhstan's gilded clans is straightforward.
Vera Kobalia, Expo's former deputy chairwoman, said in an interview that the public account of Mr. Ermegiyayev's fall was a charade. Reached by phone at her new job in Indonesia, she said that Mr. Ermegiyayev's troubles began when an executive from a music channel in Russia asked Expo to advertise and sponsor an awards show.
Nyet, said Expo staff members. The marketing budget had already been entirely allocated.
So the Russian executive called a member of the president's inner circle, who then called Expo employees, Ms. Kobalia said. Mr. Ermegiyayev had no choice. The twist is that the deal with the music channel was used against Mr. Ermegiyayev at his embezzlement trial.
"Ermegiyayev was really a scapegoat to write off the funds that disappeared during the first phase of construction of Expo," said Ms. Kobalia, a former minister of the economy in Georgia, who quit her job at Expo after little more than a month. "I personally told him to speak openly in the court or to journalists about everything he knew, but he believed until the last minute that the president would save him."
Novelty and Scale
The bold, attention-seeking gesture that is Expo is actually dwarfed by the bold, attention-seeking city where Expo is being held. Astana is Mr. Nazarbayev's most improbable creation. In 1994, he announced that the nation's capital would move 755 miles north from its original seat, Almaty, a city dense with history, culture and people.
The decision seemed ludicrous at first. Before bureaucrats started to relocate in droves, Astana was a crumbling outpost in the middle of the windswept steppe, swarming with mosquitoes in the summer and a tormenting 20 degrees below zero for much of the winter. There was one hotel and one restaurant.
Construction has yet to end, and clearly, the subtle charm of a walkable metropolis is not to Mr. Nazarbayev's taste. He likes his streets wide and his buildings striking, ornate and spread around like they fell off a Monopoly board. Some look like they have been collected, souvenir-style, from all over the world. You drive down a street and think: That looks just like the home of the Bolshoi Ballet.
"That's exactly what it is," a guide explains.
More specifically, it is a rendering of the original in Moscow, repurposed for the nearly 700,000-square-foot Astana Opera House. Moscow also inspired the neo-Stalinist Triumph Astana, home to offices, shops and apartments and a dead ringer for the Triumph Palace in Moscow.
Elsewhere, there are structures fashioned after Chinese pagodas, Indian mausoleums, Ottoman mosques and the pyramids of Egypt. The white marble presidential palace looks like the White House, if the White House had a blue dome and were set in an industrial park.
For sheer quirkiness, nothing touches the 350-foot Bayterek Tower, which local residents have nicknamed Chupa Chups because of its resemblance to a lollipop. It offers a panoramic view of Astana and a podium where visitors can place a hand over a golden mold of Mr. Nazarbayev's meaty palm. For a time, upon contact, Kazakhstan's national anthem would suddenly blast from loudspeakers, at a volume loud enough to make people wonder if they had been punked.
Astana is what you get when a city builder with money to spare tries desperately to wow through novelty and scale. Or maybe it is an effort to compensate for Kazakhstan's years of obscurity, when the czars of Imperial Russia, and then the premiers of the Soviet Union, all but sealed this place off from the world.
A few of the empire's most famous undesirables spent part of their exile here: Fyodor Dostoyevsky after he ticked offNicholas I, and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn after he ticked off Stalin. When it wasn't used for state-mandated timeouts, Kazakhstan was the Soviet Union's location of choice for outsize Cold War projects. Most lethally, it was where nuclear weapons were tested by the dozens, with shockingly little regard for basic safeguards, like evacuating residents.
When Kazakhstan achieved independence, in 1991, it aspired to create a presidential democracy based on the French model. But Mr. Nazarbayev, who rose to power through the Soviet ranks, has always seemed to have one foot in the system that created him and another in a system he hopes to create.
On the positive side, the Nazarbayev era has been relatively free of ethnic or religious strife. About 70 percent of Kazakhs are Muslims, and there are gorgeous mosques all over Astana. But the country is officially secular. A high premium is placed here on tolerance.
The influence of the Soviet system shines through in discussions about who will govern next, understandably a topic of constant speculation. Occasionally, names of potential successors are floated in the newspaper: A daughter! A nephew! A mayor! Whether these are legitimate candidates or people being backstabbed by rivals is unclear. It is no secret that Mr. Nazarbayev punishes anyone he believes is vying for his chair.
He has also nurtured the sort of cult of personality that crops up only around despots. If that cult has a headquarters it is the Museum of the First President of the Republic of Kazakhstan, a building stuffed with more than 40,000 objects from Mr. Nazarbayev's life. One room is devoted to his nomadic, horseback riding ancestors. Less is said about his father, a shepherd.
Plenty of Kazakhs roll their eyes at all of this. But the question here is always, "Compared to what?" Compared to Turkmenistan, this country is free and prosperous. Compared to France, it is not.
To Westerners, the economy has long seemed like a casino where the games are mostly rigged. Ten to 20 alliances control every financial venture worth backing. The trick is getting their attention.
"This is a country where everything is possible," veterans of business here like to say, "and everything is impossible."
Promises for Capitalism
While tourists traipsed through pavilions, a parallel Expo was unfolding above their heads. The second floor of many of the buildings were hosting panel discussions that doubled as schmoozing opportunities. An event titled "Transforming the Financial Services of Kazakhstan" was held one afternoon in a conference room above Britain's pavilion. An audience of about 20 men and women in suits listened to upbeat projections about how Kazakhstan could become the financial technology center of a new Silk Road.
The only skeptical note came from an earnest young man named Bekarys Nurumbetov, who is leads the marketing department of Kazakhtelecom, the nation's phone and broadband goliath. After the session, he explained why he was not buying all the happy talk.
"There are no financial tech companies entering Kazakhstan," he said, sipping bottled water over a plate of canapés. "They're not interested in a business with low margins and high cost and competing with banks that are supported by the government."
The problem is not corruption. "The government is O.K. with the way things are now," Mr. Nurumbetov explained. "And the banks don't want change because they don't want to lose market share."
Banks don't trust consumers, he continued, and consumers don't trust credit cards. So e-commerce companies, for example, face high and baffling hurdles.
Consider the case of Lamoda, a website that sells high-end fashion. When Alexios Shaw helped start it in 2011, he did not need just good-quality clothing and an efficient warehouse. He needed 100 couriers across the country to deliver products -- and to make change.
"It was a cash on delivery business," Mr. Shaw said. "Instead of paying in advance with a credit card, everyone paid with cash. You can't use FedEx or the post office and leave a box at the door."
Delivering pants the same way that Domino's delivers pizza is a challenge. Couriers end up with thousands of dollars worth of bills at day's end, a logistical hassle beyond the issue of trust. Just as bad, customers try on clothing while couriers wait and hand back what they don't want. That is not simply time consuming.
"The biggest problem was having a ton of goods out of stock," Mr. Shaw said. "A lot of inventory was just sort of flying around Siberia."
Several conversations like this reveal the vast gap between the country as it is now marketed and the country as it actually functions. Which is why Expo brings to mind another of the Soviet Union's grandiose schemes for Kazakhstan: the Virgin Lands Campaign.
It began in the mid-1950s, when Nikita Khrushchev decided the steppe here could produce enough corn and wheat to match the production of the United States. Millions of acres were sown by hundreds of thousands of workers who poured in from Russia and Ukraine.
Kazakhs could have told their maximum leader that his dreams were doomed. This northern region of Kazakhstan has long been called Akmola, which translates to "white grave," a reference to the hard and chalky ground beneath the earth's crust.
The Virgin Lands Campaign found Kazakhstan's agrarian limits. Expo and its aftermath promise to do the same for capitalism. It will be a challenge, say foreigners here, as tough as the soil.

Full text: FRANKFURT -- Europe has taken a small step in its long march toward economic normalcy. The European Central Bank said on Thursday that it had pondered how to wind down its easy money policies, an enormous stimulus program aimed at promoting growth and inflation in the eurozone. But the bank also postponed a decision on when it would actually do so, and will likely decide at least some of the details at its next meeting in October, the bank's president, Mario Draghi, said.
Even though the eurozone is arguably in its best economic shape in a decade, Mr. Draghi and his colleagues on the bank's Governing Council have been exceedingly cautious about ending the emergency measures that helped prevent the euro from self-destructing after the global financial meltdown in 2008.
The Federal Reserve in the United States began raising interest rates at the end of 2015, but the European Central Bank continues to flood the 19-nation eurozone with cash as a way to reduce interest rates, stimulate growth and nudge inflation from levels considered to be dangerously low. The measures have worked, for the most part, helping the region overcome a prolonged slump.
But the program -- known as quantitative easing -- has also had side effects, including fueling a steep rise in real estate prices in Germany that have led to fears of a bubble.
Mr. Draghi said Thursday that the benefits have far outweighed any negative effects. Still, with the Fed moving in the opposite direction, the European Central Bank has been under pressure to shift its policy.
He began laying the foundation on Thursday for plans to "taper" the stimulus. Although the European Central Bank's Governing Council left monetary policy unchanged, Mr. Draghi said policy makers had preliminary discussions about the program, and said they would make the "bulk" of the decisions about tapering late next month.
Yet he also left himself plenty of wiggle room in case conditions change. In particular, the central bank will be keeping a close eye on the euro's growing strength compared to the dollar, which Mr. Draghi said could alter assumptions about how the eurozone economy will perform.
"The recent volatility in the exchange rate represents a source of uncertainty which requires monitoring," he said at a news conference.
The dollar has declined more than 13 percent against the euro this year, driven largely by tensions with North Korea and dysfunction in Washington.
When the euro rises against the dollar, European exports become more expensive -- not only in the United States but also in other countries, like China, whose currencies are linked with the dollar. That typically means that European companies will sell fewer goods abroad, hurting growth and prolonging the need for central bank stimulus.
A robust euro also undercuts the bank's efforts to jolt inflation back to the official target of 2 percent, a level considered healthy for growth. A strong euro holds down consumer prices by making imported oil and other goods cheaper for eurozone residents. That's not all bad for people who live in Europe, but low inflation means that Mr. Draghi has to keep printing money longer than he would like.
The eurozone's annual rate of inflation in August was 1.5 percent, and a substantial increase is nowhere in sight. According to forecasts by the central bank's staff, inflation will still be below the target in 2019.
"It became clear at the press conference just how important the euro-dollar exchange rate is to the E.C.B.," Jörg Krämer, the chief economist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt, said in a note to clients. "If, contrary to our expectations, the euro makes further strong gains, the E.C.B. might slow down its tapering process."
There's not much Mr. Draghi can do about the weak dollar, which analysts say reflects pessimism about the ability of President Trump and Congress to agree on legislation that many economists believe would help bolster growth in the United States, such as infrastructure programs or corporate tax reform.
"Investors no longer trust the American government to push through tax reform and fiscal stimulus," Alwin Schenk, a portfolio manager at the German bank Sal. Oppenheim, said in a note to clients.
The dollar's decline is also an expression of the nervousness investors feel about geopolitics, primarily nuclear saber-rattling by North Korea and bellicose rhetoric from Mr. Trump. The euro is seen as a safe haven from turmoil.
In addition, investors have sold dollars and bought euros after becoming more optimistic about the eurozone's prospects for growth.
Mr. Draghi may have tried to talk the euro down on Thursday by stressing that a stronger currency could alter assumptions about future inflation. But if that was his goal, the jawboning did not work -- the euro rose about 1 cent to $1.20 after his remarks.
The European Central Bank is running out of time. It has been printing money for more than two years, using newly created euros to buy government and corporate bonds. It hopes to make it easier for governments to deal with their debts and cheaper for corporations to raise money that they can invest.
The bank has said it will spend 60 billion euros, or $72 billion, a month in eurozone bond markets at least through December, but has not said what it will do after that. Mr. Draghi reiterated Thursday that it would not raise its benchmark interest rate, currently zero, until it has ended the bond purchases. That means rate increases are probably still years away.
There may be another reason the European Central Bank must dial back the stimulus -- the supply of bonds may be getting scarce.
When it announced its quantitative easing program, the bank promised not to buy more than 33 percent of any one bond issue, to avoid distorting the market too much. The limit is also designed to protect against legal challenges by critics who say the bond buying is illegal because the central bank is barred by law from using its printing presses to finance eurozone governments.
Many analysts believe that it is becoming increasingly difficult for the bank to avoid exceeding the limit for German Bunds and other kinds of bonds because it has already bought so many.
Mr. Draghi dismissed those concerns Thursday. "These doubts were present at the very beginning of the program," he said. "I'm confident we will be able to exploit all the flexibility the program has."

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The last time a Category 5 hurricane ripped through Florida, it was so destructive that meteorologists retired its name forever. That storm, Hurricane Andrew, made landfall southwest of Miami in 1992, killing 65 people, destroying 63,000 homes and inflicting $26.5 billion in economic losses. But if a similar-sized hurricane were to strike Florida today in the same spot, it would be far more catastrophic -- causing up to $100 billion in damage, according to a recent analysis by Swiss Re, the reinsurance firm. That's even after accounting for the fact that South Florida has strengthened its building codes since Andrew.
The reason is simple: Central and South Florida have grown at a breathtaking pace since 1990, adding more than 6 million people. Glittering high-rises and condominiums keep sprouting up along Miami Beach and other coastal areas. A lot more valuable property now sits in harm's way.
With Hurricane Irma -- currently a Category 5 storm and one of the strongest hurricanes ever recorded in the Atlantic -- possibly set to pummel Florida this weekend, the state is confronting the fact that rapid development has made its coastline far more vulnerable to hurricane damage than it used to be.
"Florida has exploded in the last 40 years," said Megan Linkin, a natural hazards expert at Swiss Re. "If you look at images of Miami Beach from 1926" -- when the Great Miami Hurricane, a Category 4 storm, devastated the city with a direct hit -- "it's almost unrecognizable today."
Why Hurricanes Keep Getting Costlier
A similar dynamic is playing out across the United States, from Florida to Louisiana to Texas. In 2016, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that hurricanes currently cause about $28 billion, on average, in annual damage nationwide. But those costs are projected to rise 40 percent between now and 2075, after adjusting for inflation.
Nearly half of that projected increase, the C.B.O. said, is because global warming and sea-level rise are expected to make hurricanes and storm surges more severe, though the exact effects are still a source of debate among scientists.
But half of the expected rise in hurricane costs is the result of expected increases in coastal development. Today, according to the C.B.O., roughly 1.2 million Americans live in coastal areas at risk of "substantial damage" from hurricanes -- defined as damage of at least 5 percent of average income. By 2075, that number is forecast to rise to 10 million.
Population growth can also increase hurricane risks by adding newcomers who are unfamiliar with big storms or by clogging roads during evacuations, experts said.
As of Wednesday, forecasters were still unsure where Irma might make landfall in Florida or how strong it will be when it does. But in almost any conceivable scenario, a hurricane today is likely to do more damage than a comparable storm in the past, if only because of increased development.
In 1960, Hurricane Donna raged through the Florida Keys as a Category 4 storm before turning northwest to hit Naples and Fort Myers, causing roughly $7.4 billion in damage in today's dollars. According to a model developed by Roger A. Pielke, Jr., and Christopher Landsea, a similar storm today would cause $46 billion in damage, after accounting for population growth, and increased property values.
Swiss Re estimates that a storm like the Great Miami Hurricane of 1926 would inflict more than $200 billion in damage today if it struck Miami and Miami Beach directly -- exceeding the $160 billion in damage caused by Hurricane Katrina in 2005, adjusted for inflation. (Officials are still calculating the cost of Hurricane Harvey to Texas, but estimates today range as high as $180 billion.)
Nearly $80 billion of those potential losses in Florida would not be covered by insurance, the Swiss Re report said, which would "undoubtedly" affect South Florida's economic growth "over several years, hindering its capability to recover."
Those stark numbers, Mr. Pielke said, suggest that even before considering the effects of climate change, "more $100 billion disasters are probably in our future -- and we need to think harder about how to prepare for them."
Bracing for Future Storms
In response, some cities like Miami have been taking precautions against future storms -- though so far that has not included a slowdown in development.
In 1994, in the wake of Andrew, South Florida enacted some of the strictest building codes in the country. New houses must now feature impact-resistant windows or shutters as well as stronger clips and straps to secure their roofs, to better withstand major hurricanes, which inflict much of their damage through powerful winds that can send debris flying dangerously. Local zoning rules also require high-rise developers in key areas to build to withstand high winds.
"There's no question that these building codes have improved our hurricane risk," said Shahid Hamid, director of the Laboratory for Insurance, Financial and Economic Research at Florida International University, which has built a wind machine that can simulate hurricane-force winds to test new building designs.
But, Dr. Hamid cautioned, stricter codes don't offer perfect protection. Roughly 70 percent of the region's buildings were built before 1994, and many homes have not been retrofitted (though homeowners can get a substantial cut in their insurance premiums if they do so). And, he said, a direct hit from a Category 5 hurricane, with sustained wind speeds greater than 157 miles per hour, can cause heavy damage to even the best-constructed homes.
What's more, even high-rises built to withstand fierce winds can still be vulnerable to water damage from heavy rains that can seep in through roofs, as investigators discovered after Hurricane Wilma clobbered the region in 2005.
There is also flooding and storm surge to consider. Hurricane Andrew pushed relatively little water inland in 1992 and did most of its damage through ferocious winds that flipped over cars and pulverized homes. But sea levels along Miami's coasts have risen 3.3 inches since then, and the city is already seeing an increase in "sunny-day flooding" during high tides. With sea levels higher, a hurricane that struck in a vulnerable place could conceivably produce far greater flooding than Andrew did.
"Every hurricane is different," said Jean-Pierre Bardet, dean of the college of engineering at the University of Miami. "I'd expect that if we had a direct hit, we'd see damages that we were not expecting."
While stricter building requirements have made the cost of development somewhat more expensive, they have hardly put a brake on South Florida's frenetic growth, as millions of people move for the sunny weather and gorgeous beaches. Miami-Dade County's population has grown 35 percent since Hurricane Andrew, and developers still have ample incentive to build along the coastline.
In Florida, which has no state income tax, property taxes make up 36 percent of state and local revenues, and few cities have opted to take drastic measures to limit development along the hugely desirable coasts.
"It's a struggle that every community is facing in South Florida," Mr. Bardet said. "There is a constant battle between our ability to prepare for hurricanes and the pressure for urban expansion. It's a great place to live. But it does come with some risk."

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Stanley Fischer, the vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, said Wednesday that he would resign in mid-October, an unexpected decision that gives President Trump greater leverage over central bank policy. Mr. Fischer, 73, cited "personal reasons" in a brief letter addressed to Mr. Trump. His four-year term was to have ended next June.
The resignation puts immediate pressure on the Trump administration to replenish the Fed's depleted board. Mr. Fischer's departure would leave only three people in the seven board seats, the smallest number of governors in the Fed's history.
It also means that Mr. Trump can appoint a majority of the Fed's board, bending the direction of its policy. Mr. Trump has repeatedly said that he wants the Fed to loosen some of the regulatory strictures it has imposed in response to the 2008 financial crisis.
Among the decisions the president will have to make is whether to replace Janet L. Yellen as chairwoman or keep her on when her four-year term ends in early February. He faces a choice between a nominee who, like Ms. Yellen, stresses economic growth, or someone more palatable to conservatives who favor greater emphasis on curbing inflation.
Mr. Fischer joined the Fed's board in May 2014 after a distinguished career as an academic economist and an international policy maker. He sometimes argued that the Fed should be raising interest rates more quickly, sparring with Ms. Yellen. But he provided reliable support for measures strengthening financial regulation.
In recent months he has joined Ms. Yellen in warning against weakening regulations that have been enacted since 2008. In an unusually frank interview with The Financial Times last month, Mr. Fischer described efforts to roll back those regulations as "dangerous and extremely shortsighted."
Ms. Yellen thanked Mr. Fischer for leading the Fed's work to increase financial stability.
"Stan's keen insights, grounded in a lifetime of exemplary scholarship and public service, contributed invaluably to our monetary policy deliberations," Ms. Yellen said in a statement that the Fed released with Mr. Fischer's letter.
Mr. Trump has not been in a rush to refill the Fed's board. There were two vacancies when he took office, and a third seat opened in the spring. So far the White House has put forward only one candidate, Randal K. Quarles, a Utah investor who was nominated in July to join the board as vice chairman for supervision. The Senate Banking Committee was expected to send his nomination to the full Senate in a vote on Thursday.
Administration officials earlier this year settled on Marvin Goodfriend, a Carnegie Mellon economist, for a second seat, but Mr. Trump has not made the nomination.
As for Ms. Yellen's position, an administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Wednesday that the president was still reviewing candidates. Gary Cohn, the chief White House economic adviser, has been mentioned as a possible nominee. But a person close to the president said Mr. Cohn had fallen out of favor -- although not totally out of the running -- after expressing distress last month in an interview with The Financial Times over the administration's response to violent clashes in Charlottesville, Va.
The Fed's board had at least five members from 1936 until 2009. The head count was reduced to four during brief stretches in 2009, 2010, and 2014. But by far the longest stretch in Fed history with only four board members began in March of this year.
It is the first time that a majority of votes on the Federal Open Market Committee, which makes monetary policy, have been held by the presidents of the Fed's regional reserve banks -- who, unlike most officials with policy authority, are neither directly elected nor confirmed by the Senate. The committee includes the members of the board and the 12 reserve bank presidents, five of whom hold votes at any given time.
Mr. Fischer spent two decades as a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where his students included Mario Draghi, now president of the European Central Bank, and Ben S. Bernanke, Ms. Yellen's predecessor as Fed chief.
Then, in the late 1980s, he embarked on a second career in public service, first as chief economist at the World Bank, then as a senior official at the International Monetary Fund and as governor of the Bank of Israel. By the time he arrived at the Fed, he was widely regarded as leading expert on both the theory and the practice of central banking.
Analysts said Mr. Fischer's departure was unlikely to shift monetary policy in the near term. The Fed is widely expected to announce after its next meeting in mid-September that it will begin to reduce its holdings of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities.
The Fed has raised its benchmark interest rate twice this year, to a range between 1 percent and 1.25 percent. Most officials predicted in June that the Fed would raise rates one more time this year, but sluggish inflation could cause the Fed to hesitate.

Full text: LOS ANGELES -- Jeff Bock, a senior analyst at Exhibitor Relations, an entertainment research firm, summed up Hollywood's dismal summer at the domestic box office -- estimated ticket sales fell to a 22-year low -- by going on an "I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take this anymore" rant. "The message from American moviegoers over the summer was not subtle," Mr. Bock said. "Please, we are begging you, give us something more than soulless, half-baked sequels and remakes that are made by committee and primarily designed to sell merchandise."
Even so, studios are unlikely to shift gears anytime soon. Overseas audiences continue to devour what Hollywood serves up. And many studio executives dismiss the recent slump in North America, which remains the world's No. 1 movie market, as a normal part of a cyclical film business. Box office behemoths, they insist, are just around the corner.
On Friday, for instance, New Line Cinema, a Warner Bros. division that has been a resurgent force in the horror genre, is expected to blow the cobwebs off theater seats with "It." An adaptation of Stephen King's 1986 novel about Pennywise the demonic clown, "It" may arrive to $70 million or more in domestic ticket sales, breaking September box office records, analysts say. The fall season will also bring potential megahits like "Thor: Ragnarok," "Blade Runner 2049" and "Justice League."
But it will take more than a handful of blockbusters to undo the damage of a lethargic summer. From the first Friday in May to Labor Day, a period that typically accounts for 40 percent of annual ticket sales, box office revenue in the United States and Canada is expected to total roughly $3.78 billion, a 16 percent decline from the same period last year, according to comScore, which compiles ticketing statistics.
To find a slower summer, you have to go back to 1995, when "Apollo 13" and "Pocahontas" were top draws, according to Box Office Mojo, an online database. After adjusting for inflation, the summer of 1995 had about $3.76 billion in ticket sales.
Recent days were particularly terrible. Friday to Sunday, theaters in North America sold about $74.7 million in tickets, a 25 percent decline from the same period last year. With no new wide releases, the No. 1 draw was again "The Hitman's Bodyguard" (Lionsgate), which collected an estimated $10.3 million, for a three-week total of $55 million.
The only new offering was the long-gestating drama "Tulip Fever," which the Weinstein Company released with little fanfare in 765 theaters. That poorly reviewed film arrived to a dismal $1.2 million in ticket sales. Audiences also ignored the 40th anniversary rerelease of "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" (Sony), which took in about $1.8 million in 901 theaters.
Although an overreliance on superheroes is a perennial analyst worry, the summer months -- in one positive development for Hollywood -- brought little evidence that moviegoers are tiring of comic-book adaptations. Indeed, the top three ticket sellers at domestic theaters were Warner's "Wonder Woman," with $409 million; Disney's "Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," with $390 million; and Sony's "Spider-Man: Homecoming," with $324 million.
Several non-superhero movies also succeeded. "Dunkirk," with $178.8 million in domestic ticket sales, became the most successful summertime drama since "Pearl Harbor," which collected about $277.5 million in 2001, after adjusting for inflation. Two modestly budgeted movies -- "Girls Trip," a buddy comedy about four black women, and "Baby Driver," a quirky heist caper -- broke through and took in more than $100 million apiece. Among indies, "The Big Sick," an unconventional romantic comedy, was a big hit, with about $40 million in ticket sales.
A single thread ran through each one of those successes: They received euphoric reviews from critics (a positive score of 89 or higher on the Rotten Tomatoes 100-point scale), sending a message that they were high-quality endeavors and thus worthy of a trip to theaters. "This was the summer when the scales really tipped toward quality," Mr. Bock said. "Serving up sludge for a story? No, thanks -- we'll stay home and stream."
Subpar storytelling undoubtedly contributed to clunkers like "King Arthur: Legend of the Sword," "Baywatch," "The Dark Tower," "The Mummy," "The House" and "Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets," all of which were battered by bad reviews.
More than ever, moviegoers also seemed to decide that most mid-budget dramas and comedies were skippable, at least during their theatrical runs. The well-reviewed "Detroit" bombed. "Logan Lucky," "Rough Night," "Snatched" and "Atomic Blonde" all fell short of expectations. Film festival darlings like "Patti Cake$" and "Brigsby Bear" also collapsed.
Analysts chalked up another group of misfires to franchise fatigue. "War for the Planet of the Apes," the third chapter in a rebooted series, and "Alien: Covenant," the eighth "Alien" installment, were box office letdowns. So was "Transformers: The Last Knight." "Cars 3" delivered the second-lowest domestic gross in Pixar history, ahead of only "The Good Dinosaur." (On the plus side, "Cars 3" got better reviews than "Cars 2," perhaps polishing up that franchise's reputation.)
"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales" and "Despicable Me 3" were both seen as domestic disappointments, with ticket sales that fell roughly 35 percent behind their respective franchise predecessors, after adjusting for inflation.
But both of those films were smash hits overseas -- thus explaining why studios will continue to rely on sequels. The latest "Pirates of the Caribbean" took in $792 million worldwide for Disney, and "Despicable Me 3," from Illumination Entertainment and Universal Pictures, was the No. 1 movie of the summer on a global scale, with ticket sales of $976 million.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text: CORRECTION APPENDED. ROCHESTER -- Gail Evans and Marta Ramos have one thing in common: They have each cleaned offices for one of the most innovative, profitable and all-around successful companies in the United States.
For Ms. Evans, that meant being a janitor in Building 326 at Eastman Kodak's campus in Rochester in the early 1980s. For Ms. Ramos, that means cleaning at Apple's headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., in the present day.
In the 35 years between their jobs as janitors, corporations across America have flocked to a new management theory: Focus on core competence and outsource the rest. The approach has made companies more nimble and more productive, and delivered huge profits for shareholders. It has also fueled inequality and helps explain why many working-class Americans are struggling even in an ostensibly healthy economy.
The $16.60 per hour Ms. Ramos earns as a janitor at Apple works out to about the same in inflation-adjusted terms as what Ms. Evans earned 35 years ago. But that's where the similarities end.
Ms. Evans was a full-time employee of Kodak. She received more than four weeks of paid vacation per year, reimbursement of some tuition costs to go to college part time, and a bonus payment every March. When the facility she cleaned was shut down, the company found another job for her: cutting film.
Ms. Ramos is an employee of a contractor that Apple uses to keep its facilities clean. She hasn't taken a vacation in years, because she can't afford the lost wages. Going back to school is similarly out of reach. There are certainly no bonuses, nor even a remote possibility of being transferred to some other role at Apple.
Yet the biggest difference between their two experiences is in the opportunities they created. A manager learned that Ms. Evans was taking computer classes while she was working as a janitor and asked her to teach some other employees how to use spreadsheet software to track inventory. When she eventually finished her college degree in 1987, she was promoted to a professional-track job in information technology.
Less than a decade later, Ms. Evans was chief technology officer of the whole company, and she has had a long career since as a senior executive at other top companies. Ms. Ramos sees the only advancement possibility as becoming a team leader keeping tabs on a few other janitors, which pays an extra 50 cents an hour.
They both spent a lot of time cleaning floors. The difference is, for Ms. Ramos, that work is also a ceiling.
Kodak 1987 vs. Apple 2017
Eastman Kodak was one of the technological giants of the 20th century, a dominant seller of film, cameras and other products. It made its founders unfathomably wealthy and created thousands of high-income jobs for executives, engineers and other white-collar professionals. The same is true of Apple today.
But Kodak also created enough working-class jobs to help create two generations of middle-class wealth in Rochester. The Harvard economist Larry Summers has often pointed at this difference, arguing that it helps explain rising inequality and declining social mobility.
"Think about the contrast between George Eastman, who pioneered fundamental innovations in photography, and Steve Jobs," Mr. Summers wrote in 2014. "While Eastman's innovations and their dissemination through the Eastman Kodak Co. provided a foundation for a prosperous middle class in Rochester for generations, no comparable impact has been created by Jobs's innovations" at Apple.
Ms. Evans's pathway was unusual: Few low-level workers, even in the heyday of postwar American industry, ever made it to the executive ranks of big companies. But when Kodak and similar companies were in their prime, tens of thousands of machine operators, warehouse workers, clerical assistants and the like could count on steady work and good benefits that are much rarer today.
When Apple was seeking permission to build its new headquarters, its consultants projected the company would have 23,400 employees, with an average salary comfortably in the six figures. Thirty years ago, Kodak employed about 60,000 people in Rochester, with average pay and benefits companywide worth $79,000 in today's dollars.
Part of the wild success of the Silicon Valley giants of today -- and what makes their stocks so appealing to investors -- has come from their ability to attain huge revenue and profits with relatively few workers.
Apple, Alphabet (parent of Google) and Facebook generated $333 billion of revenue combined last year with 205,000 employees worldwide. In 1993, three of the most successful, technologically oriented companies based in the Northeast -- Kodak, IBM and AT&T -- needed more than three times as many employees, 675,000, to generate 27 percent less in inflation-adjusted revenue.
The 10 most valuable tech companies have 1.5 million employees, according to calculations by Michael Mandel of the Progressive Policy Institute, compared with 2.2 million employed by the 10 biggest industrial companies in 1979. Mr. Mandel, however, notes that today's tech industry is adding jobs much faster than the industrial companies, which took many decades to reach that scale.
Many of the professional jobs from those companies in the 1980s and '90s have close parallels today. The high-paying positions setting corporate strategy, developing experimental technologies and shaping marketing campaigns would look similar in either era.
But a generation ago, big companies also more often directly employed people who installed products, moved goods around warehouses, worked as security guards and performed many of the other jobs needed to get products into the hands of consumers.
In part, fewer of these kinds of workers are needed in an era when software plays such a big role. The lines of code that make an iPhone's camera work can be created once, then instantly transmitted across the globe, whereas each roll of film had to be manufactured and physically shipped. And companies face brutal global competition; if they don't keep their work force lean, they risk losing to a competitor that does.
But major companies have also chosen to bifurcate their work force, contracting out much of the labor that goes into their products to other companies, which compete by lowering costs. It's not just janitors and security guards. In Silicon Valley, the people who test operating systems for bugs, review social media posts that may violate guidelines, and screen thousands of job applications are unlikely to receive a paycheck directly from the company they are ultimately working for.
And the phenomenon stretches far beyond Silicon Valley, where companies like Apple are just a particularly extreme example of achieving huge business success with a relatively small employee count. The Federal Express delivery person who brings you a package may well be an independent contractor; many of the people who help banks like Citigroup and JPMorgan service mortgage loans and collect delinquent payments work for contractors; and if you call your employer's computer help desk, there's a good chance it will be picked up by someone in another state, or country.
Apple emphasizes that its products generate many jobs beyond those who receive a paycheck from the company directly. The company estimates 1.5 million people work in the "app economy," building and maintaining the mobile applications used on Apple products. Apple stores in 44 states tend to offer more generous pay and benefits than is standard in the retail industry. And it is growing quickly, including far from its California headquarters, such as with 6,000 jobs in Austin, Tex., at an average salary of $77,000 a year, and many more indirectly through what it says is $50 billion in annual spending to suppliers in the United States.
"We're responsible for creating over two million jobs in the U.S., across all 50 states," said an Apple spokesman, "ranging from construction, customer care, retail and engineering to app development, manufacturing, operations and trucking. All Apple employees, whether full time or part time, are eligible for benefits and stock grants. We're also fortunate to have skilled contractors that contribute to our products and services daily, along with over 9,000 suppliers in every state."
Perhaps the biggest indictment of the more paternalistic approach taken by an earlier generation of corporate behemoths is that, Kodak, despite having been an early innovator in digital photography, is a shell of its former self. After a bankruptcy and many years of layoffs, the company now has only 2,700 employees in the United States and 6,100 worldwide.
But it is also clear that, across a range of job functions, industries and countries, the shift to a contracting economy has put downward pressure on compensation. Pay for janitors fell by 4 to 7 percent, and for security guards by 8 to 24 percent, in American companies that outsourced, Arindrajit Dube of the University of Massachusetts-Amherst and Ethan Kaplan of Stockholm University found in a 2010 paper.
These pay cuts appear to be fueling overall inequality. J. Adam Cobb of the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania and Ken-Hou Lin at the University of Texas found that the drop in big companies' practice of paying relatively high wages to their low- and mid-level workers could have accounted for 20 percent of the wage inequality increase from 1989 to 2014.
The same forces that explain the difference between 1980s Kodak and today's Apple have big implications not just for every blue-collar employee who punches a timecard, but also for white-collar professionals who swipe a badge.
Forklifts vs. 3D Maps
Phil Harnden was coming out of the Navy in 1970 when he applied for a job at Kodak, and soon was operating a forklift in a warehouse. He made $3 an hour, equivalent to $20 an hour today adjusted for inflation. That is roughly what an entry-level contracting job testing software pays.
The difference between the two gigs, aside from the absence of heavy machinery in Apple's sleek offices, is the sense of permanence. Mr. Harnden put in 16 years operating forklifts before he left in 1986 to move to Florida. When he returned 10 years later, he was quickly rehired and even kept his seniority benefits.
In interviews, tech industry contractors in Silicon Valley describe a culture of transience. They can end up commuting to a different office park that houses a new company every few months; in many cases 18 months is the maximum a contractor is allowed to spend at one company.
"I would rather have stability," said Christopher Kohl, 29, who has worked as a contractor at several Silicon Valley companies, including a stint doing quality assurance on Apple Maps. "It's stressful to find a new job every 12 to 18 months."
For Silicon Valley's contracting class, there are reminders large and small of their second-class status. Contractors generally do not receive the stock options that have made some midlevel Silicon Valley workers wealthy over the years, nor the generous paid time off for vacation, illness or the birth of a child. The health insurance plans tend to be stingier than those that the tech giants they serve provide for their direct employees.
The smaller reminders can be just as telling. One former Apple contractor recalled spending months testing a new version of Apple's operating system. To celebrate the release, the Apple employees they'd worked closely with on the project were invited to a splashy party in San Francisco, while the contractors had beers among themselves in a neighborhood pub.
The compensation these white-collar contractors receive puts them squarely in the middle rungs of workers in the United States, and the most skilled can make six figures (though that doesn't go far in the hyper-expensive Bay Area housing market). Apple, based on its consultants' report, expected to be indirectly responsible for nearly 18,000 jobs in Santa Clara County by now at an average pay of about $56,000 a year.
There are some advantages. If they work for one of the companies like Apple or Google that feature a subsidized, high-quality cafeteria, contractors can enjoy the food. They can tell their friends that they work at one of the world's most admired companies, and enjoy predictable, regular hours. Once in a while, a contractor will be hired into a staff position.
"It's not evil," said Pradeep Chauhan, managing partner of OnContracting, a site to help people find tech contracting positions. "They have a job and they're getting paid. But it's not ideal. The problem with contracting is, you could walk in one day and they could say, 'You don't need to come in tomorrow.' There is no obligation from the companies."
And that is the ultimate contrast with the middle-skill, middle-wage jobs of earlier generations of titans -- a sense of permanence, of sharing in the long-term success of the company.
"There were times I wasn't happy with the place," Mr. Harnden said of his Kodak years. "But it was a great company to work for and gave me a good living for a long time."
Transmissions vs. Staplers
When an automaker needs a supplier of transmissions for its cars, it doesn't just hold an auction and buy from the lowest bidder. It enters a long-term relationship with the supplier it believes will provide the best quality and price over time. The company's very future is at stake -- nobody wants to buy a car that can't reliably shift into first gear.
But when that same automaker needs some staplers for the office supply cabinet, it is more likely to seek out the lowest price it can get, pretty much indifferent to the identity of the seller.
Labor exists on a similar continuum.
The right product engineer or marketing executive can mean the difference between success or failure, and companies tend to hire such people as full-time employees and as part of a long-term relationship -- something like the transmission supplier. What has changed in the last generation is that companies today view more and more of the labor it takes to produce their goods and services as akin to staplers: something to be procured at the time and place needed for the lowest price possible.
There is plenty of logic behind the idea that companies should focus on their core competence and outsource the rest. By this logic, Apple executives should focus on building great phones and computers, not hiring and overseeing janitors. And companies should outsource work when the need for staff is lumpy, such as for software companies that may need dozens of quality-assurance testers ahead of a major release but not once the product is out.
There's no inherent reason that work done through a contractor should involve lower compensation than the same work done under direct employment. Sometimes it goes in the other direction; when a company hires a law firm, it is basically contracting out legal work, yet lawyers at a firm tend to be paid better than in-house counsel.
But as more companies have outsourced more functions over more time, a strong body of evidence is emerging that it's not just about efficiency. It seems to be a way for big companies to reduce compensation costs.
Firms in the United States are legally required to offer the same health insurance options and 401(k) match to all employees -- meaning if those programs are made extra generous to attract top engineers, a company that doesn't outsource will have to pay them for everyone.
More broadly, there are a whole set of social pressures and worries about morale that encourage companies to be more generous with pay and benefits for employees who are on the same payroll.
"There was an overriding concern about equity," said Mr. Cobb, the Wharton professor. "Firms would try to set pay so that the gap between the security guard or administrative assistant and senior V.P. wasn't as great as you might expect, essentially by paying lower- and middle-skill workers more than they were probably worth on the market."
Linda DiStefano applied for a secretarial job at Kodak during Easter week of her senior year in high school in 1968, and was hired to start immediately after her graduation for $87.50 a week, today's equivalent of $32,000 a year. She put in four decades at the company, first as a secretary, then helped administer corporate travel and other projects.
"I helped put on the dinners for the board of directors, which in retrospect someone of my grade shouldn't have been doing," she said. "But I had a series of managers who trusted me."
It bought her a house off Lake Avenue, a new car every few years and occasional long-distance trips to Motown reunion concerts. When her department was abolished in 2008, the travel bookings contracted out, she was making $20 an hour. The best job she could find was as a pharmacy technician at a grocery store for $8.50 an hour.
Rochester vs. Cupertino
As you drive around Rochester, the role of Eastman Kodak in the city is evident everywhere, in the Kodak Tower that looms over the center of town, in the Eastman Theater on Main Street, and in the hulking buildings and empty parking lots of the manufacturing center known as Kodak Park.
In reading the company's old annual reports, you get a sense that its executives thought of the jobs created and the wages paid as a source of pride and achievement. On the first page of most years' annual reports was an accounting of how many employees the company had in the United States and worldwide, and the total pay and benefits they received.
Apple, with a spaceship-like campus about to open, looms large over Cupertino in its own way, accounting for something like 40 percent of the jobs in the city, and investing $70 million in local environmental and infrastructure upgrades. It is no middle-class enclave; the median home price is $1.9 million.
"We definitely feel a sense of pride to be the home of Apple," said Savita Vaidhyanathan, the mayor of Cupertino. "But they consider themselves a global company, not necessarily a Cupertino company." She said she has never met Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive. "We would have a hard time getting an audience with anybody beyond upper-middle management," she said.
Ms. Ramos, the Apple janitor, lives down the road in San Jose. She pays $2,300 monthly for a two-bedroom apartment where she and her four children live. Before overtime and taxes, her $16.60 an hour works out to $34,520 a year. Her rent alone is $27,600 a year, leaving less than $600 a month once the rent is paid. Overtime, in addition to the wages from one of her teenage children who works part time at a grocery store, helps make the math work, though always tenuously.
She works from 6 p.m. until 2 a.m. On days when one of the other cleaners doesn't show up, she may get a few extra hours, which is great for the overtime pay, but it means even less sleep before it is time to take her children to school.
A 60-cent-an-hour raise this year negotiated by her union, the SEIU United Service Workers West, helped. Kodak in its prime was not unionized, though in that era when organized labor was more powerful over all, managers deliberately kept wages high to try to prevent the company's workers from forming one.
There is little chance for building connections at Apple. "Everyone is doing their own thing and has their own assignment, and we don't see each other outside of work," said Ms. Ramos in Spanish.
Ms. Evans, who was a Kodak janitor in the early 1980s before her rise to executive there and at other leading firms like Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard, recalls a different experience.
"One thing about Eastman Kodak is they believed in their people," said Ms. Evans, now chief information officer at Mercer, the human resources consulting giant. "It was like a family. You always had someone willing to help open a door if you demonstrated that you were willing to commit to growing your skills and become an asset that was valuable for the company."
The shift is profound. "I look at the big tech companies, and they practice a 21st-century form of welfare capitalism, with foosball tables and free sushi and all that," Rick Wartzman, senior adviser at the Drucker Institute and author of "The End of Loyalty," said. "But it's for a relatively few folks. It's great if you're a software engineer. If you're educated, you're in command."
But in the 21st-century economy, many millions of workers find themselves excluded from that select group. Rather than being treated as assets that companies seek to invest in, they have become costs to be minimized.

Correction: September 10, 2017, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An Upshot article last Sunday about how an increase in outsourcing at large companies has fueled economic inequality misstated a measure of Apple's job creation compared with Kodak's decades ago. Apple has created tens of thousands of working-class jobs; it has not fallen short of matching Kodak in that regard. The article also misstated the amount of a wage increase that Marta Ramos, a janitor at Apple, received this year. Her raise was 60 cents an hour, to $16.60 hourly. It was not a dollar-an-hour raise.

Full text: CARACAS, Venezuela -- Food shortages were already common in Venezuela, so Tabata Soler knew painfully well how to navigate the country's black market stalls to get basics like eggs and sugar. But then came a shortage she couldn't fix: Suddenly, there was no propane gas for sale to do the cooking.
And so for several nights this summer, Ms. Soler prepared dinner above a makeshift fire of broken wooden crates set ablaze with kerosene to feed her extended family of 12.
"There was no other option," said Ms. Soler, a 37-year-old nurse, while scouting again for gas for her stove. "We went back to the past where we cooked soup with firewood."
Five months of political turmoil in Venezuela have brought waves of protesters into the streets, left more than 120 people dead and a set off a wide crackdown against dissent by the government, which many nations now consider a dictatorship.
An all-powerful assembly of loyalists of President Nicolás Maduro rules the country with few limits on its authority, vowing to pursue political opponents as traitors while it rewrites the Constitution in the government's favor.
But as the government tries to stifle the opposition and regain a firm grip on the nation, the country's economic collapse, nearing its fourth year, continues to gain steam, leaving the president, his loyalists and the country in an increasingly precarious position.
Petróleos de Venezuela, the state oil company that is the government's main source of income, reported in August that its revenue fell by more than a third last year amid production declines -- part of a long collapse that chokes the country's supply of dollars needed for imports of food and other goods.
The falling production mirrors trends in nearly every product that the nation depends on, from potatoes and corn to automotive manufacturing, with fewer than 1,100 cars made in the country through July this year.
And while production falls, prices continue to rise with inflation. The price of food in Venezuela increased by more than 17 percent in July alone, according to the main nongovernmental group that tracks inflation, aggravating a food crisis that had already shattered the image of Venezuela, an oil-rich nation that, until recent years, was the economic envy of many countries in the region.
"This is unprecedented," said Ricardo Hausmann, an economist at Harvard University and former Venezuelan planning minister, contending that the economic declines are worse than those in Mexico during its economic collapse in the 1990s, Argentina in the 2000s and Cuba after the fall of the Soviet Union.
In one nine-day stretch in late July and early August, the price of the bolívar, the national currency, fell by half against the dollar on the black market, cutting earnings for people who make the minimum wage to the equivalent of just $5 per month.
Even though the government has been raising the minimum wage relentlessly, it has not nearly kept up with inflation, leading to an 88 percent drop in earnings over the past five years for the workers who rely on it, Mr. Hausmann said.
Luis Palacios, a 42-year-old former security guard here in the capital, Caracas, has gone hungry as inflation has decimated his wages. He spent a year watching his family lose weight, until his wife took their two children, 1 and 5, to Colombia five months ago in order to get more food.
"My child was thin," he said. "We couldn't get medicine when she was sick."
His wife decided not to return. Mr. Palacios, unable to afford the public bus to get to work, quit his job a month ago because inflation rendered his salary nearly worthless. His severance pay lost much of its value in the two weeks he had to wait for it to arrive.
"I've lost seven kilos in just a few months, and since my family left, I can only think of my children," he said.
Cash has dwindled so much in value that it has disappeared in places, like Mariel Bracho's taxi stand at the country's main airport. Ms. Bracho takes only debit cards or bank transfers, and still has a sign with prices dating back a year ago because the company hasn't been able to find paper or ink to print a new one.
"But there's not even many people who take a taxi from the airport anymore," she said, given the cost.
It's a pattern that leaves people like Olympia Jiménez, a 49-year-old waiter in Caracas, terrified about his wages and tips. They're vanishing, he says, because even when people are well off enough to eat at a restaurant, they cannot carry enough bills to leave even a small tip on the table.
Mr. Jiménez's solution: He leaves clients his full name, address and banking details so they can transfer money to his checking account.
"They've given me up to 40,000 bolívars that way," he said, which is about $2.50 at the current black market exchange rate but would require a staggering amount of cash in a country where the main note remains the 100 bolívar bill.
Many economists trace the inflation to problems at the state oil company.
As the company's production declined, it became increasingly dependent on the outside world, depending on foreign companies to pump its oil and even on the United States for the crude oil used in refining. Now the use of these foreign contractors is generating steep bills at a time when the company has little income to pay them.
The Venezuelan government's answer has been to pay in bolívars whenever possible and to print more cash. In a single week in late July, the country's monetary base, or the amount of cash that exists in the country, rose by 13 percent, the highest increase many economists said they had ever seen. While printing more cash shores up the oil company in the short-term, it lowers the value of the currency for Venezuelans.
"Bolívars are like ice cubes now," said Daniel Lansberg-Rodriguez, who leads the Latin America practice at Greenmantle, a macroeconomic advising firm, and teaches at Northwestern's Kellogg School of Management. "If you're going to go to the fridge and take one, it's something you have to use right now, because soon it's going to be gone."
For the 34-year-old owner of a fireworks company in Caracas, one of the main challenges has been converting the bolívars he receives into dollars. Last year, he could find people selling dollars, the owner said, declining to give his name because exchanging bolívars on the black market is illegal. Now, he can still find black market dealers, he said, but it is much more costly.
Most Venezuelans, like Ms. Soler, the nurse who began cooking with firewood, don't have access to dollars.
Since running out of gas this summer, Ms. Soler's family members have been able to find it only intermittently, buying it as soon as it's available because the value of their money depreciates so quickly. If the gas runs out again, the family say it is prepared, having learned to cook on the bonfire set up in the patio.
But Ms. Soler's main fear, she says, is the price going beyond what she can afford.
"Before it was cheap; you just had to wait six hours in line," she said. "Now you might get it, but it's expensive."

Full text: MACUNGIE, Pa. -- At the sprawling Mack Trucks factory here, the last of the workers laid off in 2016 after sales slowed down are back on the line, and for the first time in years, the company is hiring new employees. The turnabout in the Lehigh Valley, whose shuttered factories inspired Billy Joel's elegiac 1980s song "Allentown," was evident more broadly on Friday, when the Labor Department reported that manufacturers nationwide added workers last month at the fastest pace in more than four years.
Hiring in other sectors was more muted, with the economy creating 156,000 jobs, fewer than expected and well off the much bigger employment gains earlier this summer. The unemployment rate edged up slightly to 4.4 percent, while wages barely grew.
Still, the latest payroll data underscores the striking rebound at American factories, which lost more than two million jobs in the recession, but have clawed their way back and recovered more than one million positions since 2010.
President Trump campaigned as a champion of domestic manufacturing, and promoted recent announcements by Foxconn and Toyota that they would build new domestic factories, but the bulk of those job gains came under Mr. Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama.
Sentiment among both business leaders and consumers has improved markedly since Mr. Trump's victory in November, though, and manufacturers have indeed stepped up the pace of hiring this year. A closely watched private survey released on Friday showed factory activity at a six-year high.
An uptick in consumer spending also elevated the Commerce Department's latest reading on economic growth earlier this week.
Dennis Slagle, Mack's president, said his company's hiring reflected increased demand for its big trucks. "We've seen confidence rise," he said, noting that truckers benefit whether shoppers do their buying online or at brick-and-mortar stores. "If you bought it, we brought it."
Auto sales were down slightly in August, continuing 2017's soft trend, but employment at vehicle and parts factories, which includes truck makers like Mack, managed to climb by 14,000 last month.
After dropping to 1,287 at the end of 2016 from 1,875 a year earlier, employment at Mack's Macungie plant has rebounded to 1,800. To attract new workers, the company has set up tables at local job fairs, including one in May at Coca-Cola Park in Allentown, home of the AAA Lehigh Valley IronPigs baseball team.
The company has had a presence in the Lehigh Valley since 1905, when the Mack brothers moved truck production to Allentown from Brooklyn, where the company was founded in 1900.
It has endured even as giants like Bethlehem Steel, which once employed thousands of workers who turned hot metal into finished steel, vanished. And unlike many of its competitors, it builds both the truck cabs and components like engines and transmissions in the United States.
Mack is foreign-owned -- by the Volvo Group of Sweden -- but the parent company recently completed an $84 million project to modernize and expand the Macungie factory. Mack plans to roll out its first new truck line in about two decades on Sept. 13.
"Labor relations are good enough that they were willing to spend that much money," said Edward Balukas, president of Local 677 of the United Automobile Workers union, which represents production line employees at Mack. Salaries start at $18.75, according to Mr. Balukas, rising to $27 after six years, and the jobs come with a full benefit package and retirement plan.
That top pay rate is a bit higher than the national average hourly wage of $26.39, which rose by just 0.1 percent in August, less than expected and below July's 0.3 percent increase.
One explanation for stagnant wage growth -- even with low unemployment and steady hiring -- is automation, as workers like retail store clerks, tollbooth operators and bank tellers are forced to move on and take whatever jobs they can find.
Robots really are not much of a presence at Mack, however, where workers in T-shirts and shorts clamber atop newly finished chassis to attach hulking cabs that move on an overhead belt.
Big rigs represent a major investment for buyers -- prices start at about $115,000 and can run as high as $250,000 for a dump truck. And their customized nature makes it hard to automate production, said Jonathan Randall, senior vice president for North American sales at Mack.
"We build fleets one at a time," he explained. "It takes skilled human beings to do that."
Mack also resolved to keep nearly all of its production in the United States, rather than move some south of the border, as competitors like Navistar have done.
"It's not a bed of roses when you go down to Mexico," said Mr. Slagle, Mack's president. "We feel this is the place to be."
Mack's position is not new, but it does come as pressure mounts from the White House on domestic manufacturers to stay put. On Friday, negotiations between the United States, Mexico and Canada to restructure the North American Free Trade Agreement resumed in Mexico City, and the prospects are unclear.
The jump in manufacturing last month, along with construction, stands in sharp contrast to some service sectors, where job growth was much less impressive.
Retailers shed 900 jobs, confirming the assault on traditional stores by online retailers. Leisure and hospitality, which has been especially robust in recent months, added just 4,000 positions, while the public sector lost 9,000.
Those losses help explain why August's overall payroll increase fell well short of the 180,000 gain that economists on Wall Street had been expecting. But few took it as a sign of more fundamental weakness, especially because the initial August figure has come in below expectations in five of the last six years, only to be revised higher in some cases.
"In months where there are anomalies like this, we look at the three-month average, which is 185,000," said Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays. "The labor market is healthy, but we still have the conundrum that solid employment gains haven't translated into faster wage growth."
One wild card in the second half of 2017 will be gasoline prices. The surge following Hurricane Harvey's devastation in Texas will leave less money for consumers to spend on other goods and services.
On Friday morning, the average price for regular gasoline nationwide was $2.52, a 7-cent increase from Thursday. Prices have risen 15 cents a gallon in the last week, and the current price is 30 cents above the national average for regular gasoline a year ago. Over the course of a year, every penny increase is equivalent to a $1 billion tax on consumers.
But Wall Street was happy with the report -- benchmark indexes closed up 0.2 percent Friday -- as the slowdown in hiring and minimal wage growth mean the Federal Reserve is likely to stick to its promise to raise interest rates only gradually.
"For the economy, it's steady as she goes, but for the markets, it's Goldilocks," said Torsten Slok, chief international economist at Deutsche Bank, referring to the not-too-hot, not-too-cold August payroll increase.
Traders now assume a 30 percent chance of a rate increase when Fed policy makers meet in December, down from a 50 percent chance a few weeks ago. The Fed is set to meet later this month, but is not expected to raise rates.
Like many economists, Mr. Slok does expect the Fed to move at the end of the year, even if market participants are betting otherwise. "There's no sign of inflation, which keeps the Federal Reserve on hold in terms of interest rate hikes, and it suggests stocks should keep doing well," Mr. Slok said.

Jobs Numbers and the Folly of a 'Presidential Scorecard'

Full text: The details of the August jobs numbers are disappointing, though hardly catastrophic. The United States economy added fewer jobs than analysts expected (156,000, not 180,000); previous months' job growth was revised down (by 41,000 positions); the unemployment rate ticked up a bit (to 4.4 percent from 4.3 percent); and wages continued growing at only a glacial pace (0.1 percent).
That may be a result of some weirdness that has crept into August numbers in recent years because of the challenges of measuring seasonal variation, or it could reflect a job market that is less vibrant than it had seemed a few months ago. Time will tell, and either way it's still a fairly strong economy.
In that sense, these numbers highlight a widely made mistake in how we have been talking about the economy since Inauguration Day, and really for long before Donald J. Trump took office.
There's an inevitable tendency to view economic data as a continuing presidential scorecard. On the first Friday of the month, a White House economic adviser goes on cable networks to either boast about or explain away the latest numbers.
As of Friday evening, President Trump had made no comment on Twitter about the mediocre August numbers, but four weeks ago he was so quick to promote July's "excellent jobs numbers" that he violated a rule that specifies public officials should wait an hour after they're released to comment.
There are two things wrong with this "presidential scorecard" framework for thinking about economic data. First, the overall trajectory of the economy looks very much the way it did this time a year ago; if you assume some amount of statistical noise, in broad brush strokes the 2017 economy looks pretty much identical to the 2016 economy. Second, this early in an administration, things the president does have had little impact on job growth, G.D.P. or unemployment.
The numbers are straightforward. Job growth has averaged 170,000 positions a month since February, the first full month of the Trump administration. That is below the 208,000 average of the last six months of 2016, but the slower pace of job creation shouldn't be surprising. With the economy closer to full employment now -- the unemployment rate is at 4.4 percent instead of the 4.9 percent in the middle of last year -- employers looking to add jobs are working against a harder constraint on the number of workers.
Meanwhile, most other indicators suggest "steady as she goes." The wage growth number, 2.5 percent over the last year, is right at the level at which it has bounced around for years. There was a bit of a stir, earlier in the week, when second-quarter G.D.P. growth hit 3 percent. But there have been individual quarters like that now and again since this expansion. The 2.1 percent average growth rate in the first half of the year reflects the same basic trend for the last eight years.
You can view that from a glass-half-full or half-empty perspective depending on your temperament. The good news is that a slow and steady expansion means that most Americans who want a job can now get one, and wages are growing faster than (low) inflation.
The bad news is that wages and incomes are rising more slowly than what has been normal in recent decades, and millions of prime-age Americans remain on the sidelines of the labor market. (The single worst piece of news in the August numbers is that the proportion of those 25 to 54 working actually fell by 0.3 of a percentage point, to 78.4 percent.)
Once you view the 2016 economic data as indicating stability, the question is how much credit or blame the Trump administration deserves.
There are of course many ways presidents affect the economy, including tax and spending policies they enact, their approach to regulating major industries and appointments to the Federal Reserve.
But on all of these frontiers, there hasn't been enough change since January to account for any change in hiring behavior by businesses. The tax code remains the same as it was on Jan. 20, and there have been no changes to federal spending in the fiscal year about to end. No Trump appointees have been confirmed to serve on the Fed.
The picture on regulatory policy is more complicated, and certainly agencies have leeway in interpreting and enforcing existing regulations that Trump appointees are using in more pro-business ways. In regulated industries like banking and energy production, companies may make investment decisions based on expectations of what is coming out of Washington. But the actual repeal of regulations or the writing of new ones is a lengthy, arduous process that is only getting underway.
Presidents in general have less control over the economy than headlines tend to suggest. But a year from now -- when there may be Trump-signed tax legislation, a Trump-appointed Federal Reserve chair, and a bunch of regulations devised by Trump appointees -- it will make more sense to ask what the current administration means for the economy.

Full text: United States markets rose on Friday as investors viewed a relatively weak jobs report for August as likely to help keep interest rates low. Shares of banks, energy companies and automakers led the way. The Labor Department said employers added 156,000 jobs in August. That was a bit less than analysts expected, but investors were pleased that the economy kept growing at a steady pace while inflation remained weak.
They bet that will keep the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates too quickly.
Shares of car companies rose as they reported their August sales, on expectations that hundreds of thousands of cars would have to be replaced after being damaged by rains and flooding this week along the Gulf Coast. Bank stocks rose as bond prices dropped, which sent yields and interest rates higher.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 4.90 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,475.55. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 39.46 points, or 0.2 percent, to 21,987.56. The blue-chip index had its first change in more than two years on Friday, as the longtime Dow component DuPont combined with its former rival Dow Chemical to form DowDuPont.
The Nasdaq composite added 6.67 points, or 0.1 percent, to 6,435.33. It was the best week this year for the Nasdaq as shares of technology and health care companies surged.
Long-term government bond prices moved lower. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.17 percent from 2.12 percent, but the yield on the two-year note remained at 1.33 percent. Still, the increase in bond yields and interest rates gave banks a lift. JPMorgan Chase shares rose 81 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $91.70.
General Motors said its sales improved in August, and its stock gained 82 cents, or 2.2 percent, to $37.36. Ford picked up 32 cents, or 2.9 percent, to $11.35. Fiat Chrysler stock gained 73 cents, or 7.2 percent, to $61.68.
Benchmark United States crude added 6 cents to $47.29 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price international oils, fell 11 cents to $52.75 a barrel in London. Wholesale gasoline prices, which have surged this week, declined 3 cents to $1.75 a gallon.

Full text: Stocks rose again in the United States on Thursday, with investors pleased by a report that showed that spending by American consumers, along with wages and salaries, grew in July. Health care and technology companies led the way, and the Nasdaq composite index closed at a record high. The Commerce Department said consumer spending had grown at its fastest pace in three months. Companies that sell products including cosmetics, toys and shoes advanced as investors bet that Americans would shop more.
Consumer spending rose 0.3 percent in July, the best showing in three months, the Commerce Department said, as wages and salaries increased.
"The economy is gaining traction, and inflation at this stage is still modest," said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. That has been good for stocks, as low inflation and low interest rates make stocks more appealing and securities like bonds less appealing.
Ms. Krosby added that other news, including a manufacturing survey from China, had "helped underpin the notion that it is a global recovery in the economy."
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbed 14.06 points, or 0.6 percent, to 2,471.65, its highest close in three weeks. That allowed the index to finish August with a tiny gain. The Dow Jones industrial average added 55.67 points, or 0.3 percent, to 21,948.10. The Nasdaq composite gained 60.36 points, or 1 percent, to 6,428.66, above the record high it set in late July. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks picked up 13.95 points, or 1 percent, to 1,405.28.
The drugmaker Biogen gained $12.81, or 4.2 percent, to a two-year high of $316.56, and Gilead Sciences rose to its highest price in more than a year as it moved up $2.48, or 3.1 percent, to $83.71.
Technology companies, which are trading at record highs over all, rose for a fourth consecutive day. Alphabet, Google's parent company, gained $11.61, or 1.2 percent, to $955.24, and Microsoft picked up 76 cents, or 1 percent, to $74.77.
Among retailers, Amazon gained $13.01, or 1.3 percent, to $980.60. The jewelry seller Tiffany added $3.75, or 4.3 percent, to $91.40. The tool maker Stanley Black & Decker picked up $4.22, or 3 percent, to $144.
After three days of losses linked to the effects of the storm that struck Texas as Hurricane Harvey, benchmark United States crude jumped $1.27, or 2.8 percent, to $47.23 a barrel in New York as the rains on the Gulf Coast began to abate. Brent crude, used to price international oils, added $1.52, or 3 percent, to $52.38 a barrel in London.
Campbell Soup skidded to a two-year low after the company forecast a smaller-than-expected annual profit after reporting a weak fourth quarter that included disappointing sales of snack food. Its stock lost $4.05, or 8.1 percent, to $46.20. Campbell's competitor Mondelez dropped 97 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $40.66, and Kraft Heinz gave up $1.18, or 1.4 percent, to $80.75. All of those companies' stocks have tumbled this year.
The discount retailer Dollar General reported a bigger profit and better sales than Wall Street had expected, but it said discounts had hurt its profit margins. The stock had rallied since early July, but on Thursday it lost $4.17, or 5.4 percent, to $72.56.
Bond prices moved higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.12 percent from 2.14 percent.
Gold rose $8.10 to $1,322.20 an ounce. Copper added 1 cent to $3.10 a pound.
The dollar dipped to 109.97 yen from 110.36 yen. The euro rose to $1.1904 from $1.1888.

Full text: United States markets climbed on Wednesday as investors cheered a report of stronger economic growth. Shares of technology companies, retailers and travel providers all made solid gains. The Commerce Department raised its estimate for economic growth and said gross domestic product grew at its fastest pace in two years between April and June. Along with technology companies and consumer-focused firms, shares of health care companies and banks finished higher. Prominent stocks like Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook made some of the biggest gains.
"For all the tough times we've had the last couple of weeks, the thing that's kept the market afloat is the strong economic data," said Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management.
With more economic reports coming over the next few days, Mr. Schutte said investors would be looking for evidence of higher pay and greater inflation, adding that stocks should keep rising as long as the economy remained in good shape and inflation did not pick up.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 11.29 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,457.59. The Dow Jones industrial average picked up 27.06 points, or 0.1 percent, to 21,892.43. The Nasdaq composite gained 66.42 points, or 1.1 percent, to 6,368.31 as shares of technology companies rose for the third day in a row.
The government raised its gross domestic product projection from last month, and the second-quarter estimate was much better than the first quarter, when growth was 1.2 percent.
Private businesses added 237,000 jobs in August, with broad gains across several industries including construction, manufacturing and leisure and hospitality, according to a survey by the payroll processor ADP.
Shares of the chip maker Analog Devices advanced after the company announced strong results in the third quarter along with a better-than-expected revenue forecast for the current period. Its stock jumped $4.17, or 5.2 percent, to $83.72. Microsoft stock gained 96 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $74.01 and Facebook shares picked up $1.87, or 1.1 percent, to $169.92. Amazon shares rose $13.53, or 1.4 percent, to $967.59, and Bank of America stock climbed 41 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $23.87.
Gasoline prices rose to two-year highs and oil prices continued to fall as the Gulf Coast region was inundated with rain from Tropical Storm Harvey, which has knocked out significant oil drilling and refining capacity. On Tuesday the largest oil refinery in the country was shut down and the operator of a major pipeline carrying fuel to the East Coast said it was running at a reduced rate.
Wholesale gasoline rose another 10 cents, or 5.7 percent, to $1.88 a gallon. Benchmark United States crude lost 48 cents, or 1 percent, to $45.96 a barrel in New York while Brent crude, the international standard, fell $1.14, or 2.2 percent, to $50.86 a barrel in London.
President Trump stumped for tax cuts in an afternoon speech in St. Louis, and while investors are eager to see taxes come down, Wall Street's reaction was muted.
"Right now expectations are low enough that if anything gets done, Wall Street will cheer it," said Mr. Schutte, of Northwestern Mutual.
The Food and Drug Administration approved the first treatment that genetically engineers patients' own blood cells to seek and destroy childhood leukemia. The drug, Kymriah, is made by Novartis, and several other companies are working on similar treatments. They are called CAR-T therapies, and they are being developed for blood cancers and maybe other tumors, too.
The approval wasn't a surprise to investors, and Novartis stock dipped 88 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $82.74. Gilead Sciences shares rallied, however. Earlier this week the company agreed to buy the CAR-T drug developer Kite Pharma for $11.9 billion. Its stock gained $5.49, or 7.2 percent, to $81.23. Shares of Juno Therapeutics, which is studying a similar treatment, lost $3.52, or 8 percent, to $40.29.
In other energy trading, heating oil added 1 cent to $1.67 a gallon. Natural gas lost 4 cents to $2.94 per 1,000 cubic feet.
Gold fell $4.80 to $1,314.10 an ounce. Silver dipped 2 cents to $17.40 an ounce. Copper lost 2 cents to $3.06 a pound.
Bond prices inched lower after a big jump the day before. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.14 percent from 2.13 percent.
The dollar rose to 110.32 yen from 109.71 yen. The euro declined to $1.1888 from $1.1992.
European stocks bounced back after several days of losses. In Germany, the DAX rose 0.5 percent, as did the CAC 40 in France, and the FTSE 100 in Britain added 0.4 percent. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 rose 0.7 percent and the Kospi in South Korea gained 0.3 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng jumped 1.2 percent.

Surprising Briskness In Economic Growth

Full text: The current recovery has entered its ninth year -- long by economic standards -- but it is showing some unexpected vigor. The Commerce Department said on Wednesday that the economy had expanded at an annual rate of 3 percent in the second quarter of the year, better than initially estimated, and a substantial acceleration over the first quarter's lackluster 1.2 percent pace.
The revised figure is still well below President Trump's goal of 4 percent growth, but it is the economy's best quarterly showing in two years.
Mr. Trump talked up the latest figures in a speech on Wednesday in Springfield, Mo., laying out his plans for tax overhaul. Despite nearly uniform skepticism from mainstream economists, he insisted that much faster economic growth was within reach.
"I happen to be one who thinks we can go much higher than 3 percent," the president said. "There is no reason why we should not."
There are several reasons that his goal is probably far-fetched, namely the country's aging work force and slower population growth than in the past. Combine that with low productivity growth, and hitting Mr. Trump's target begins to look like a Sisyphean challenge.
The president also suggested that other economies overseas were growing at two or three times the American rate. "You look at other countries and what their G.D.P. is, they are unhappy when it is 7, 8, and 9," he said.
No major Western economy is growing close to that rate -- and none has in years. The fastest-growing large economy, China's, grew 6.7 percent last year.
Still, with personal consumption accounting for nearly 70 percent of economic output, the new willingness of shoppers to open their wallets is a good sign.
"The economy is stronger than you think," said Chris Rupkey, the chief financial economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group in New York. "Bet on it."
The improvement was driven in large part by strong consumer activity, with purchases of durable goods like automobiles and appliances rising strongly. Increased business spending also helped lift the latest estimate above Commerce Department's initial reading of 2.6 percent for the quarter.
The surge in consumer spending stands in stark contrast with the problems plaguing brick-and-mortar stores like Sears and Macy's, which have been forced to close dozens of locations this year amid fierce competition from online retailers like Amazon.com.
The government's data reflects all purchases, whatever the retail channel, which explains why malls and street-level stores may be suffering even as consumers become more bullish and the broader economy powers ahead.
Most economists are expecting the economy to expand at a rate of roughly 3 percent in the second half of 2017. That pace should be strong enough to keep job growth and wages on track for further gains, while keeping the threat of inflation modest for now.
Besides wild cards like Hurricane Harvey's impact on a broad swath of the Gulf Coast, and political uncertainty about issues like tax overhaul and a possible increase in infrastructure spending, traders are also keeping an eye on the Federal Reserve.
Most experts believe the central bank will raise interest rates just once more this year, but a faster economy or an increase in wages or inflation could prompt policy makers to move more quickly to tighten monetary policy and shrink the Fed's balance sheet in 2018.
Janet L. Yellen, the Fed chairwoman, and other policy makers will also be closely watching data expected on Friday morning from the Labor Department on hiring, wages and unemployment in August. Economists estimate that the economy added 180,000 jobs, but a stronger gain, like July's 209,000 jump, or an uptick in wages, would focus more investor attention on the Fed's next meeting on Sept. 19 and 20.
At a speech last week in Jackson Hole, Wyo., Ms. Yellen focused mostly on the continuing need for regulation, rather than the outlook for growth, but she did term the current economy "strong."
On Wednesday, some economists offered improved expectations for job creation in August after the payroll processor ADP reported that private employers added 237,000 jobs, well above the 185,000 increase that had been expected.
The acceleration in spending suggests that a so-called Trump bump -- improved sentiment among consumers and more optimism among business leaders -- may be translating into concrete actions like homeowners buying new appliances and companies investing in new software or equipment.
"The consumer is in the driver's seat in terms of economic growth," said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco. "It puts us on a stronger path going into the third quarter, although Hurricane Harvey introduces some uncertainty."
Mr. Anderson expects growth in the range of 3 to 3.5 percent in the current quarter, but he said the hurricane could shave as much as 0.3 percentage points off that figure. A hit like that would mostly be reversed in the year's final quarter as rebuilding efforts kicked in, he added.
It will take more than one quarter's data for the White House or congressional Republicans to be able to claim credit for lifting the economy's growth trajectory. Under President Barack Obama in 2013 and 2014, quarterly growth occasionally exceeded 3 percent. But, in contrast to what happened during recoveries in the 1990s and mid-2000s, annual growth never passed that threshold.
If the economy were to sustain the current pace of expansion, it would be a significant uptick from the 2 percent annual growth rate that has mostly prevailed since the recovery began.
A difference of a single percentage point may not sound like much, but the stakes are huge in a $19 trillion economy. The acceleration could also help lift wage growth, which has been frustratingly slow for years despite steady hiring, a surging stock market and rising home prices.
Private-sector estimates of third-quarter growth have also inched higher lately. Macroeconomic Advisers now forecasts a 3.4 percent expansion rate for the current quarter, up from the 2.9 percent figure it forecast earlier this month.
Increases in consumer spending and business investment powered nearly all of the revision issued on Wednesday. Factors like net exports and residential investment barely changed, while government spending added only 0.1 percentage points.
The Commerce Department offers three estimates of growth as more data becomes available, with the final figure for second-quarter economic activity to be released on Sept. 28.

Full text: SPRINGFIELD, Mo. -- President Trump on Wednesday pitched a sweeping tax overhaul that he said would unleash the American economy and help ordinary people, promising that a large corporate tax cut and trims to individual income tax rates would boost the middle class. The president wrapped his message in the populist rhetoric that powered his presidential campaign. But he described a plan that on its surface appears to offer relatively little to ordinary Americans, granting instead huge tax cuts -- "the biggest ever," he said -- to corporations and their shareholders.
Mr. Trump gave few specifics on Wednesday beyond a goal of slashing the corporate tax rate to 15 percent, down from 35 percent, and eliminating "loopholes and complexity that primarily benefit the wealthiest Americans and special interests," a reference to his call to scrap some itemized deductions in the code.
The politically difficult legislation has yet to be drafted despite months of private negotiations among members of the Trump administration and Republicans on Capitol Hill. Time is running out for enactment of the bill before year's end, and the White House is keenly aware that if Mr. Trump fails to deliver his promised tax cuts, he will emerge from his first year in office devoid of any major legislative accomplishments.
"This is our once-in-a-generation opportunity to deliver real tax reform for everyday hard-working Americans," the president said as he stood in front of a giant American flag at the Loren Cook Company, a fan manufacturer. "And I don't want to be disappointed by Congress."
"Lower taxes on American business means higher wages for American workers," he added.
Many economists believe it is not that simple. They argue that large corporate tax cuts would do relatively little -- particularly in the near term -- to boost wages or create jobs. Instead, they would boost corporate profits and benefit the wealthiest Americans who own the most corporate stock. There is little evidence that large tax cuts will prompt American corporations to invest more; they are already sitting on nearly $2 trillion in cash.
And with the economy growing at 3 percent -- Mr. Trump exulted over the figure during his speech on Wednesday, saying, "I happen to be one who thinks it can go much higher" -- the Federal Reserve has warned that it would move to curb faster growth for fear of inflation.
"Corporate profits are at record highs," said Michael Linden, a fellow at the Roosevelt Institute. "Corporations are sitting on a vast amount of capital. Reducing their tax burden would have absolutely no effect on workers."
Business groups eager to see substantial tax cuts argued the opposite.
"A reform package that lowers tax rates and encourages investment will enable and encourage more people to start businesses," Karen Kerrigan, the president of the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Council, said in a statement. "Of course, if small-business owners can keep more of their hard-earned capital, they will reinvest those resources back into their employees and enterprises."
That is a minority view among economists, but one that has been gaining ground.
For many years, experts agreed that corporate taxes did not affect wages. American companies were stuck in the United States, so they had no leverage to lower workers' wages. Instead, taxes reduced profits.
The rise of globalization changed that calculus -- particularly in industries like manufacturing, where it is relatively easy to move jobs overseas. The conventional estimate now is that workers bear about a quarter of the burden of taxation, but some estimates are much higher.
"If a firm faces a higher tax rate, you're not going to pass that off to shareholders or consumers because you're competing in a global marketplace," said Aparna Mathur, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative research organization. "So it's labor that bears the brunt."
It follows that when taxes are reduced, labor gets some of the benefit.
Mr. Trump called on Republicans and Democrats on Wednesday to come together to support the effort. He then singled out Senator Claire McCaskill, Missouri's Democratic senator, who faces re-election next year, for a pointed threat.
"She must do this for you," the president said of delivering on his tax-cut promises. "And if she doesn't do it for you, you have to vote her out office."
Beyond the politics, Mr. Trump made plain the broad outlines of his vision for overhauling the tax code: a combination of deep cuts for businesses large and small as well as for investors and the wealthiest, along with reductions for middle-class people, only partly paid for by eliminating some deductions and boosting economic growth. He spoke of a "business" tax cut rather than strictly a corporate one, a nod to his proposal to allow small businesses and large partnerships to take advantage of the same rate as corporations, a costly change.
In 2012, the neighboring state of Kansas slashed its taxation of business income, prompting a stampede by wealthy Kansans -- including the head football coach at the University of Kansas -- to turn themselves into businesses for tax purposes.
Democrats seized on the disconnect between Mr. Trump's tax-cutting message and the large reductions for businesses and high earners that he has championed.
"If the president wants to use populism to sell his tax plan, he ought to consider actually putting his money where his mouth is and putting forward a plan that puts the middle class, not the top 1 percent, first," Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said in a conference call organized by progressive groups that are planning an intensive advertising and advocacy campaign to oppose Mr. Trump's tax-cutting initiative.
Mr. Trump portrayed his plan as an evenhanded approach that would help both businesses and working people, suggesting that his call for scrapping deductions would harm wealthy people such as himself.
"I'm speaking against myself when I do this, I have to tell you," remarked Mr. Trump.
Mr. Trump has not released his tax returns, making it impossible to assess the personal effect of his proposals. But independent analyses of the broad outlines have concluded that wealthy taxpayers would get most of the benefits. One proposal, the elimination of estate taxation, would benefit only the wealthy.
Private negotiations among Gary D. Cohn, Mr. Trump's top economic adviser; Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary; and Republican congressional leaders and tax writers have yet to yield a proposal embraced by the White House and Republican lawmakers.
Mr. Trump may be forced to temper his ambitions. . Administration officials are now discussing a plan that would cut the 35 percent corporate tax rate to 20 to 25 percent, substantially higher than the 15 percent the president called for in April.
In his speech, Mr. Trump hinted at the challenge of securing a cut of the scale he wants, saying, "Ideally -- and I say this for our secretary of the Treasury -- we would like to bring our business tax rate down to 15 percent."
Administration officials are also weighing leaving the top individual tax rate, which they wanted to lower to 35 percent, at its current 39.6 percent level.
The timetable has slipped considerably, as well. Mr. Mnuchin noted last week that his goal to produce a tax proposal by August never materialized.
In laying out what he called his principles for a tax overhaul, Mr. Trump made no mention of insisting that cuts be offset by corresponding increases to avoid adding to the deficit, essentially acknowledging publicly what his aides have privately for weeks: that he is willing to accept a plan that adds to the deficit, which had long been considered anathema to many conservative Republicans.
If Mr. Trump lacked specifics for his plan, the White House made sure he would not lack for cheerleaders. In the hours after he spoke, several members of his cabinet, including some who have little to do with his economic agenda, issued statements praising the president's effort. Among them were Rex W. Tillerson, the secretary of state, and Ryan Zinke, the secretary of the interior, who said it would allow families to better afford vacations to national parks.
But many Republicans, even those broadly supportive of Mr. Trump's plans, have scaled back their ambitions, conceding that the calendar makes a full-scale tax rewrite unlikely and resolving instead to push through the largest tax cut possible by New Year's.
"It's important to get this done this year," said Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri, "and at some point, we'll have to make the decision, 'O.K., how much of the tax-code fight can we get into and still have the kinds of reduction in rates and achievable results that mean more American jobs and better American jobs?"'

Full text: Here's what to expect in the week ahead: "Brexit"
Britain and the European Union meet Monday for a third round of negotiations. Several issues remain unresolved, including the size of Britain's "divorce bill" -- an attempt to settle its various financial commitments and debts -- and the status of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Time becomes more of an issue each month, as Britain must leave the bloc by March 2019. Prashant S. Rao
Monthly Job Figures
On Friday, the Labor Department will release the latest data on unemployment and hiring in August. Economists estimate that the economy added about 180,000 jobs in August, a bit slower than July's gain of 209,000, but that's still considered a very healthy pace, especially with the unemployment rate at 4.3 percent.
The jobless rate isn't expected to change, and in addition to the payroll figure, experts will also be closely watching average hourly earnings. For now, wage growth and the threat of inflation remain modest. Wall Street estimates that wages rose by 0.2 percent in August, bringing the annual increase to 2.6 percent. Nelson D. Schwartz
Nafta
Following a testy kickoff early this month, the next round of renegotiation talks for the North American Free Trade Agreement will begin in Mexico City on Friday. The initial discussions put deep political divisions into harsh relief, with the United States representative, Robert Lighthizer, saying that the agreement had fundamentally failed to bolster American economic interests and had led to trade deficits that are unfair to American citizens. His Canadian and Mexican counterparts, however, tried to shift focus away from those deficits and highlight other points.
All three nations agree that Nafta regulations need to be updated to address e-commerce and other technological advances. Zach Wichter
Amazon's Takeover of Whole Foods
The ink will barely have time to dry on Amazon's takeover of Whole Foods before the internet giant starts changing the way the high-end grocery store does business. Amazon announced that when the deal has been completed on Monday, it would slash prices for a variety of products immediately. Following that announcement last week, shares of other major grocery chains fell as the markets anticipated a price war -- as usually happens when Amazon enters a new retail category.
Amazon has not yet announced the dollar amounts of its new pricing plan, but analysts say the reductions could be as much as 25 percent for some products. Zach Wichter
G.D.P.
On Wednesday, the Commerce Department will release its second estimate of economic growth in the second quarter. Not much revision is expected from the initial estimate of 2.6 percent last month, but growth in the second half of 2017 is thought to have picked up a bit from that pace. Nelson D. Schwartz
Monthly Auto Sales
Automakers are expecting good news on Friday when the industry reports new vehicle sales in the United States for the month of August. After seven straight months of year-over-year declines, sales could increase slightly compared with 2016. The auto-research firm Edmunds.com forecasts total sales at 1.53 million, which would represent a 1 percent increase. Sales of trucks and sport utility vehicles continued to gain market share at the expense of traditional passenger cars, benefiting automakers that have recently added new S.U.V. models, including General Motors, Fiat Chrysler and Toyota.

Full text: LOS ANGELES -- Movie theaters were open over the weekend, but it was hard to tell by ticket sales, which were held back by lethargic new movies, competition from a pay-per-view boxing match and Hurricane Harvey. The top 12 films took in $49.6 million in North America, according to comScore. To find a lower top-12 total, you have to go back to 2001, when the Sept. 11 attacks resulted in mid-September weekend ticket sales of about $43.5 million, according to data from Box Office Mojo. But even that total rises to $59.7 million after adjusting for inflation.
Grosses may be even worse next weekend, when no films are scheduled to arrive in wide release. The last time theaters saw such a void over the Labor Day holiday was 25 years ago, according to the entertainment trade news site Deadline.com.
Hollywood always struggles in late August, when families and college students turn their attention to back-to-school activities and other people hit the road for one last summer getaway. Rather than try to push crowds into theaters, the major studios essentially give up and hold back new films.
So the only new movies arriving in wide release over the weekend (1,500 screens or more) were from independents. The Weinstein Company booked an animated film called "Leap!" into 2,575 theaters and collected about $5 million, according to comScore. BH Tilt and WWE Studios rolled out a micro-budgeted kung fu drama, "Birth of the Dragon," in 1,618 theaters and managed $2.5 million in ticket sales.
The No. 1 movie was a holdover, "The Hitman's Bodyguard" (Lionsgate), which took in about $10.1 million for a two-week domestic total of $39.6 million -- hit territory for a film that carried relatively modest production and marketing costs. The horror sequel "Annabelle: Creation" (Warner Bros.) was second, collecting roughly $7.4 million, for a three-week total of $77.9 million. Third place went to "Leap!"
The only other new release was "All Saints" (Sony), a faith-based movie that cost about $2 million to make. It collected about $1.6 million from 846 locations.
An already slow weekend was made worse by competition from television; the Saturday night fight between Floyd Mayweather and Conor McGregor was expected to generate $500 million in pay-per-view sales in the United States alone. Paul Dergarabedian, a senior comScore analyst, said that movie-theater turnout in Texas was unusually low -- the likely result of Harvey, which made landfall near Corpus Christi on Friday and caused catastrophic flooding in Houston.
A few specialty films had notable ticket sales. "Wind River," a mystery written and directed by Taylor Sheridan ("Hell or High Water"), expanded into more locations in its fourth weekend and took in $4.4 million, according to the Weinstein Company, which released the film. Total ticket sales for "Wind River" now stand at nearly $10 million.
The indie comedy "The Big Sick" (Lionsgate) collected $745,000 in its 10th weekend of release, pushing total ticket sales to roughly $40 million. With that result, "The Big Sick," which debuted at the Sundance Film Festival, joined an elite club: Over the last decade, only two other Sundance entrants have crossed that mark. The others were "Manchester by the Sea," which generated $47 million earlier this year, and "Precious: Based on the Novel 'Push' by Sapphire," which earned $55.2 million in 2009, after adjusting for inflation.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text: The recent finding by The New York Times that black students are still vastly underrepresented at the nation's top colleges and universities is one sign of how little the country has managed to do to close racial gaps. Unemployment rates among black workers give a similarly gloomy picture. The jobless rate for black Americans is generally about twice that of white Americans, a ratio that improves only somewhat in "good" times, like the present, and persists no matter the level of educational attainment. The overall unemployment rate for black workers is now 7.4 percent and for white workers is 3.8 percent. For college-educated workers, the recent average jobless rate was 4.2 percent for blacks, compared with 2.5 percent for whites.
The hard truth is that the persistence of twice-as-high joblessness for black workers has led policy makers to accept it is as normal. Just look at the Federal Reserve. Monetary policy is supposed to foster stable prices and full employment. But the Fed has historically favored inflation fighting over boosting employment, a policy bias that generally leads it to raise interest rates before the job market is as strong as possible, as measured by low unemployment and rising pay for all groups of workers. The Fed has already raised rates twice this year and many Fed officials appear to favor a third increase by year's end, with evident disregard for the fact that black unemployment is now at levels that prevailed for white workers in 2012, when the economy was still very much in the shadow of the Great Recession.
Another hard truth is that even when the economy picks up and employers are on a hiring binge, black people have a harder time getting jobs and are paid less than similarly situated white workers. That is exactly what happened from 1996 to 2000, the last genuinely hot job market, and it points clearly to racial discrimination, not just in hiring, but in a range of public policies that disproportionately affect black people. These include the dearth and high cost of child care, which harms single mothers the most; poor public transportation in many rural and suburban areas, which makes keeping a job difficult; and mass incarceration of black men and the barriers to employment that go with it.
Other factors include erosion and weakness in the enforcement of labor standards and legal safeguards. The wage gap between black and white workers is larger now than it was in 1979 or in 2000, and has grown the most for college graduates.
The whole economy is weighed down by the higher unemployment among black Americans, in part because it deprived the economy of consumer demand, the main engine for growth. Worse, the job and wage gap signals a loss of human potential, a singularly valuable form of capital. The economy cannot be said to be at full employment while black workers lag behind their white counterparts. Nor can the society be said to be just or healthy.

Full text: Jack Rosenthal, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, government official and civic leader who was the principal editor of a landmark 1968 federal report on urban riots that found an America moving "toward two societies, separate and unequal," died on Wednesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 82. The cause was complications of pancreatic cancer, his wife, Holly Russell, said.
Mr. Rosenthal, the son of a refugee judge from Nazi Germany, merged multiple careers into a lifelong commitment to public service.
He was a spokesman and strategist for Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy during the 1960s civil rights upheaval, oversaw the editorial page of The New York Times, where he championed criminal justice reforms and spotlighted the challenges of an aging population, and edited The Times Magazine.
He later nurtured numerous civic ventures, including raising millions of dollars for victims of the 2001 World Trade Center attack as president of The New York Times Foundation.
Mr. Rosenthal was the principal editor of a 265-page report by the Kerner Commission, officially called the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders, led by Gov. Otto Kerner Jr. of Illinois and created by President Lyndon B. Johnson to investigate the causes of the racial uprising in 1967. Mr. Rosenthal wrote the chapter titled "The Future of the Cities."
Choosing integration as a goal, he wrote, would require more federal spending to mitigate the impact of segregation and deprivation in urban neighborhoods and expand opportunities for better housing, jobs and schools.
"This choice would be aimed at reversing the movement of the country toward two societies, separate and unequal," his chapter concluded.
Jay L. Kriegel and Peter C. Goldmark Jr., top aides to the commission's vice chairman, Mayor John V. Lindsay of New York, highlighted the phrase in their widely circulated summary of the report, which Mr. Rosenthal edited.
While the summary's blunt language angered Johnson, the report, released in February 1968, became a best-selling book and contributed to a national debate on race, especially after urban riots broke out again that April with the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
Almost a half-century after the report was released, Mr. Rosenthal expressed regret that its prescriptions had only been partly realized. "All kinds of desegregation have occurred in sports, TV, entertainment, literature, but not in housing," he said in July in an interview for this obituary.
"What if the Irish or the Jews had been unable to move out of their ghettos?" he continued. "We would not be an integrated society. We would be an association of cantons, which is still true for black America."
Mr. Rosenthal was deputy editorial page editor of The Times when he won a Pulitzer Prize, in 1982, for distinguished editorial writing. His subjects ranged widely, reflecting a boundless curiosity and intellectual breadth.
Despite a players' walkout, he clung to the illusion of baseball as "an amiable, ordered world contained within the neat geometry of a stadium." He challenged a generally tolerated prejudice against fat people. ("The social pressure against obesity no doubt benefits the general health," he wrote. "What's troublesome is that we are all so humorless about it, so relentless, so determined to punish the overweight.")
On one day he could write about gun control: "There is no cogent argument for permitting free access to handguns. People with a legitimate need for them should not balk for a moment at sensible controls. But cogency is not the problem; it is politics."
On another day he might comment on the Reagan administration's social services agenda: "To say 'no entitlements,' or 'let the states do it,' or 'let the private sector do it' is a barely varnished way of saying 'Don't do it.' And that is not a war against inflation. It is a war against the poor."
Mr. Rosenthal edited the editorial page from 1986 to 1993, succeeding Max Frankel, who became The Times's executive editor.
Mr. Frankel, who recruited him to the newspaper's Washington bureau in 1969, said Mr. Rosenthal had "nourished countless talents among the staffs and contributors of The Times and at every turn gave voice to our shared liberal values."
Jacob Rosenthal (he changed his name to Jack "to be more American," he said) was born on June 30, 1935, in Tel Aviv to Manfred Rosenthal, a judge who became a bookkeeper after fleeing Nazi Germany, and the former Rachel Kaplan, a Lithuania native whom he had met while she was vacationing in the Middle East.
Jack was 3 when the family moved to the United States to join relatives in Portland, Ore., descendants of Jewish immigrants from Germany who had started a grocery store in California during the 19th-century Gold Rush. His father became a judicial administrator for Multnomah County, Ore.
Mr. Rosenthal graduated in 1956 with a bachelor's degree in history from Harvard (where he was later a Kennedy Fellow at the Institute of Politics), and was hired by The Oregonian, where he had worked as a $1-an-hour copy boy during high school. From there he was recruited to the Justice Department.
As a spokesman for Robert Kennedy, he brought a commitment to criminal justice reform and civil rights and a modicum of jocularity: When James V. Bennett retired as director of the Bureau of Prisons, for example, Mr. Rosenthal, for the retirement party, commissioned a cake with a file baked into it.
After a stint at Life magazine, Mr. Rosenthal joined The Times in Washington as its first national urban affairs correspondent. (He was among the last reporters to take notes on yellow legal pads with a fountain pen.)
Mr. Rosenthal was promoted to assistant Sunday editor in 1973, assistant editorial page editor in 1976, deputy editorial page editor in 1977 and editorial page editor in 1986.
After writing and editing editorials for 16 years, he edited The Times Magazine from 1993 to 2000. Then he retired, but did not stop working.
As president of The Times Foundation, he started the 9/11 Neediest Fund, which raised more than $60 million for thousands of families, and he incubated a number of nonprofits, including the National Parks of New York Harbor Conservancy.
He was also a senior fellow at the Atlantic Philanthropies and a founder of ReServe, which has connected more than 2,600 adults 55 and older with full-time jobs in government and nonprofit private agencies in 12 states.
In addition to his wife, Ms. Russell, a sculptor and former advertising agency executive, he is survived by two children, John Rosenthal and Annie Sindelar, both from an earlier marriage, to Marilyn Silver, which ended in divorce; two stepsons, Christopher and Andrew Russell; and six grandchildren.
Mr. Rosenthal never stopped writing for a variety of publications, even as he lamented that technology -- from the telegraph to the tweet -- had steadily devalued the written word.
"In the end, writing -- no matter how conversational the style -- is writing," he concluded in 2001 in the 150th anniversary issue of The Times. "That means it is permanent. In speech, to be casual is to be friendly. In writing, to follow the rules is to be clear.
"To 'talk it over' means to weigh and test; to put something into 'black and white' means to decide, to freeze the thought," he continued. "Spoken English may soften the strictures of written English, but the need for rules endures. There's a time to say 'well, kind of' and a time for writing to right wrongs."

Full text: Jack Rosenthal, who died Wednesday evening at his home in Manhattan, occupied many important roles in a career at The New York Times that began in 1969 -- urban affairs correspondent in Washington, editor of The New York Times Magazine and president of The Times Foundation. But some of the happiest and most productive times of his life were the 16 years he devoted to putting out this page, as deputy editorial page editor beginning in 1977 and as editor from 1986 to 1993. These were often turbulent times: captured hostages and roaring inflation under Jimmy Carter; "morning in America" for some, and budgetary austerity for others, under Ronald Reagan; and the end of the Cold War under the first President Bush. And at home, the near-collapse and gradual revival of New York City. The role of the editorial page, in Jack's view, was to add the institutional voice of The Times to the national and local conversation on a wide range of issues, and to that end, with great humor and even greater patience, he encouraged a robust and often contentious staff of more than a dozen writers to produce lively and thoughtful pieces on their specialties for an audience of demanding readers -- of which the most demanding was Jack himself.
Jack loved words and their many uses. Having shared a desk with Jack in the Washington bureau during the Nixon days, I joined the editorial board in 1988 to write about politics and the presidency, but the piece that tickled him most was a little one about the third college edition of Webster's New World Dictionary, which contained several thousand new words and phrases that the Webster editors thought had sufficient currency to merit inclusion: greenmail, junk bond, talking heads, hacker and Nixonian. All these were fine, Jack thought; though a purist in many respects, and a ferocious enemy of cliché and rhetorical overkill, he saw language as a living, growing organism.
In 1982, Jack won a Pulitzer Prize for a diverse collection of editorials, some of which seem up-to-date even now. Writing at a time when the main immigration issue was the need for a consistent policy at the border, not the more complex question of how to deal with 11 million unauthorized people who are already here, he issued a prescient warning: "A million people are waiting in line to enter the United States legally; millions more are eager to jump the line; and the nation must choose which to let through the door. ... The country is not now making the choice. The more the system spins out of control, the more Americans lose patience with government -- and perhaps with any immigration at all."
He also had complaints about our business, not least journalism's habit of what he called "rushing the future," which in his view only spoiled it. "The year 1976 taught that lesson. Was there an American alive who, by the time the bicentennial actually arrived, was not already glassy-eyed from all the premature puffery?" Jack, never shy about raiding the culture for material, turned to an advertising slogan of the time for that editorial's final line, "Sell no wine before its time."

Full text: GRAND TETON NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. -- Liberal activists who stage an annual protest in favor of lower interest rates at the Federal Reserve's annual conference here are planning a different kind of demonstration this year. They plan to don "Yellen wigs" on Friday to demonstrate in support of Janet L. Yellen, the Fed chairwoman, whose first term ends in February. President Trump must soon decide whether to renominate Ms. Yellen or pick someone similarly inclined to emphasize economic growth. Or, instead, he could accede to the wishes of many conservatives for a Fed chairman more worried about inflation.
The looming decision is injecting an element of uncertainty into monetary policy after years of relative stability. Ms. Yellen continued the aggressive economic stimulus campaign that was launched by her predecessor, Ben S. Bernanke, during the financial crisis that began 10 years ago, and she has moved slowly to end it.
Gene B. Sperling, the former director of President Barack Obama's National Economic Council, said the choice was a "fascinating test" for Mr. Trump, pitting conservative ideology against "the stark reality of politicians worried about how the economy performs."
The approaching fork in the road is likely to be a major topic of conversation as Fed leaders, central bankers from other countries and academic economists gather in Grand Teton National Park on Friday and Saturday for an annual policy conference.
The basic question nearly everyone is asking is how quickly the Fed will raise interest rates.
The Fed already has raised its benchmark rate twice this year, to a range of 1 percent to 1.25 percent. Officials are debating whether to raise rates for a third time, but no decision is expected before the final meeting of the year in December.
That would leave the benchmark rate at a level Fed officials regard as neutral. Low rates increase economic growth by encouraging borrowing and risk-taking, while high rates weigh on economic growth by reducing those activities.
Mr. Trump has said that he is considering another term for Ms. Yellen. But Gary D. Cohn, the director of his national economic council, is also a candidate. Ms. Yellen has not commented on her own plans, beyond committing to serve out her term.
Mr. Trump has not named other candidates, but likely possibilities for any Republican president include Kevin Warsh, a former Fed governor; John B. Taylor, an economist at Stanford University; and Glenn Hubbard, an economist at Columbia University.
Mr. Trump has sent mixed signals about his priorities. In public comments, he has repeatedly described himself as a lover of low interest rates. But last month, he nominated Randal K. Quarles, a financial industry executive who has advocated the Fed to raise interest rates more quickly, as the Fed's vice chairman for supervision.
The Trump administration also plans to nominate Marvin Goodfriend, a Carnegie Mellon University economist who is an even more outspoken critic of the Fed's stimulus campaign, to an open seat on the Fed's board.
Regulatory issues may prove an even more important consideration. Mr. Trump wants to relax some of the restrictions placed on the financial industry in the wake of the 2008 crisis. Ms. Yellen has agreed that there is room for improvement, but she has cautioned against any significant reduction in regulation.
Ms. Yellen is scheduled to speak here about financial regulation on Friday morning.
Mr. Cohn has rarely spoken publicly about his views on monetary policy, but he is a key adviser to Mr. Trump on the administration's plans to cut financial regulation.
In addition to criticism from conservatives, Ms. Yellen also has faced criticism from liberals who argue that the Fed is moving too quickly to raise rates.
Fed Up, a coalition of liberal groups, has made a tradition of bringing protesters to the Jackson Hole conference to press for more stimulus, and it staged a teach-in on Thursday to emphasize that the economic recovery remains incomplete.
"Let's not prematurely choke off this recovery," Susan Helper, an economist at Case Western Reserve University, told the activists gathered outside the conference hotel.
But this year, the group is less concerned about what Ms. Yellen might do, and more concerned about someone else taking her place.
Mr. Sperling, who also addressed the protesters, compared Ms. Yellen to Jim Harbaugh, the University of Michigan football coach who has improved the performance of that program but not yet beaten its archrival Ohio State.
"The Bernanke and Yellen Fed do deserve praise for very expansive and creative monetary policy and that there has been real policy since 2010," Mr. Sperling said. "We should also equally recognize it doesn't mean things are good enough."
The choice confronting Mr. Trump parallels the Fed's internal policy debate.
Inflation remains persistently sluggish. The Fed aims for 2 percent annual inflation, and it expects to miss that target for the fifth-straight year. Some Fed officials want to wait for evidence that inflation is rebounding before raising rates again.
Most officials, however, see the low level of unemployment as a sufficient reason for confidence that inflation will rebound. "I think we should continue with the gradual rate path," Esther L. George, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, which hosts the annual monetary policy conference here, told CNBC. "While we haven't hit 2 percent, I'm reminded that 2 percent is a target over the long term, and in the context of a growing economy, of jobs being added, I don't think it's an issue that we should be particularly concerned about unless we see something change."
Both Mr. Bernanke and Ms. Yellen were nominated in October, but there is little sign that the Trump administration is moving toward a quick decision. Mr. Trump had told The Wall Street Journal that he plans to make a decision by the end of the year.
That would leave relatively little time for the person selected by Mr. Trump to be questioned and confirmed by the Senate before Ms. Yellen's term ends in February.

Why Is the Fed So Scared of Inflation?

Full text: When the world's central bankers meet this week in Jackson Hole, Wyo., the topic on the table will be how to foster a dynamic global economy. For America's central bank, the Federal Reserve, the biggest problem is at home, not abroad, and its latest view on the economy, released last week, shows it may not have a handle on it. As Fed officials try to make sense of how low unemployment, which should drive up wages and prices, persists side by side with low inflation, most simply assume that inflation will rise by next year as labor demand lifts wages and higher wages lead to rising prices. This belief has led to two interest rate increases so far this year, in effect tapping the brakes on growth to fight inflation, with another rate increase expected this year. A more plausible view is that persistently low inflation shows the economy is more fragile than policy makers want to admit, and needs to be helped, not handicapped.
Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, has fallen short of the Fed's 2 percent target every month for five years, and decent pay raises for most working people have been few and far between, even as unemployment has dropped by nearly half, to 4.3 percent. The Fed has had to continually pull back its inflation projections.
Another sign of weakness is that eight years into an economic expansion, the share of employed workers ages 25 to 54 is less than before the Great Recession.
Much of this is beyond the Fed's control. Among the barriers to employment are the rising use of opioids and dismal job prospects for people who have been arrested or imprisoned. Better drug treatment and health care, and sentencing reform, could help, but they are not within the Fed's purview. The Fed also cannot create a plan to bolster jobs by rebuilding the nation's infrastructure. Nor can it enact an immigration plan to compensate for an aging population and smaller labor force that can restrict economic growth.
The Fed is also not responsible for advancing labor standards that help to lift wages. Republicans oppose a meaningful rise in the minimum wage, which was already inadequate when the current $7.25 hourly rate took effect in 2009. The Trump administration is undermining an Obama-era effort to lift middle-class pay by updating rules for paying time-and-a-half for overtime to salaried workers.
That said, the Fed should acknowledge the weakness in the job market and keep rates low until clear signs of wage and price increases emerge. Instead, the Fed seems to be grasping at straws to support the assumption that low unemployment will automatically lead to higher inflation.
In recent months, Fed officials have taken to attributing low inflation to "idiosyncratic" factors, including a decline in cellphone service prices, as if a one-off oddity can explain entrenched low inflation. Similarly, recent Fed research has argued that wage growth looks worse on average than it actually is because of baby boom retirements, in which relatively high-paid people leaving the labor force are replaced by younger, lower-paid workers. If baby boom retirements are to blame, though, how does one explain poor wage growth, with labor income lagging productivity gains, for most of the past 40 years?
The Fed has been a deft steward of the economy since the Great Recession. But many Americans are still struggling, and careful thinking, not wishful thinking, is needed.

Full text: President Trump has a simple answer for racial tension in the United States: jobs. In his contentious news conference Tuesday, he argued that his administration would create millions of jobs and stronger growth in wages, and that this would have a "tremendous positive impact on race relations."
"What people want now, they want jobs," Mr. Trump said. "They want great jobs with good pay. And when they have that, you watch how race relations will be."
But there's not much evidence in recent history that racial attitudes are shaped by the ups and downs of the overall economy. Certainly jobs and wages influence Americans' sense of well-being and their worldview. But attitudes about race relations seem to be overwhelmingly shaped by developments unrelated to things like the unemployment rate or growth in household incomes.
For example, Gallup polling shows that Americans' racial attitudes were stable for years amid very different economic environments. The proportion of respondents who said relations between whites and blacks are very good or somewhat good was nearly identical in 2002, near the worst of the early 2000s recession; to what it was in 2007, the peak of that decade's expansion; and to 2008, when the Great Recession was underway.
The survey results around racial attitudes changed not in the immediate aftermath of the recession, when the unemployment rate soared to 10 percent and jobs were scarce, but in 2015, when the economy was back on its feet.
In the middle of 2013, when the jobless rate was 7.5 percent, 70 percent of adults thought race relations were somewhat good or very good. By 2015, unemployment was down to a healthy 5.3 percent, but only 47 percent gave that positive reading of race relations.
One likely reason for the shift is the rise of protest movements over police killings of African-Americans. Those protests took off in August 2014, when a white police officer fatally shot Michael Brown, 18, in Ferguson, Mo. Negative polling on the state of race relations has persisted in the years since, even as the economy has continued improving. As a candidate, Donald Trump stressed the idea that immigrants were stealing American jobs.
Similarly, more distant examples also show racial attitudes moving based on noneconomic events. Perceptions of racial animus spiked in 1992, amid riots in Los Angeles, but quickly improved the next year. And the late 1990s, when the economy was booming and wage growth was strong, featured consistently negative assessments of race relations in public opinion polls.
That's not to argue that the economy and race relations have no connection. White Americans may well be more comfortable with minority groups' rising economic status when they themselves have secure jobs and rising incomes. But for nonwhites, a strong economy is not a cure-all. Janelle Jones, an analyst at the Economic Policy Institute's program studying race and the economy, argues that nationwide averages don't tell you everything you need to know about the economic experiences of African-Americans and other minority groups.
"The idea that the availability of jobs is the way to solve race relations is misguided," Ms. Jones said, in that a job alone doesn't assure a stable, prosperous standard of living.
"Even if you have jobs available, there's still discrimination in pay and promotion," she said. "Being able to have a job that pays well and comes with benefits, to buy a house in a place that isn't racially segregated, to send your kids to a school that is not racially segregated, these are parts of what makes for a quality economic outcome."
And then there's the question of what the Trump administration's policy agenda would do for those types of opportunities. Job growth has remained steady in the first seven months of the Trump administration, with the United States adding an average of 179,000 jobs a month since February compared with 187,000 a month last year. But wage growth has been only slightly faster than inflation, with average hourly earnings up 2.5 percent over the last year. That number was 2.9 percent in December.
"It has tended to be the case that when the pie gets bigger, there is more willingness to share some of the increase," said Margaret Simms, a fellow at the Urban Institute. "However, it is not clear that the number of jobs generated by the actions the president has mentioned will provide the quantity or quality of jobs that would be needed to have this impact."
Even if job growth and wages were to accelerate further, Mr. Trump also promised big things specifically for inner-city America in his comments on Tuesday. "We are spending a lot of money on the inner cities," Mr. Trump said. "We are doing far more than anybody has done with respect to the inner cities. It is a priority for me."
Mr. Trump's budget, it is worth noting, would cut spending by the Department of Housing and Urban Development by 15 percent.

The Market Has Been Magical, but It Can't Last

Full text: Some things just can't last. The nearly magical stock market that has persisted so valiantly this year is one of them. The bull market that started in March 2009 seems to have gone on forever, but that's only a small part of the story. What is astonishing is the way that stocks have risen in 2017.
The stock market has been so placid that declines of a mere 1.5 percent have been treated like real news. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped that much on Thursday. Days like that can be unsettling, but in the span of market history, they amount to the slightest of headaches.
The deeper news isn't immediately visible day to day, but it is this: The stock market has been operating in an extremely rarefied world of heightened calm, one that is unlikely to continue. It is as if, after the election in November, Wall Street entered an enchanted zone. That is bound to end.
Several statistical measurements demonstrate how unusual this market environment has been.
The most obvious is the bull market's longevity, fueled largely by the Federal Reserve's ultralow interest rates and voracious bond buying. The upward trend in stocks already ranks as the second longest in American history since 1900 and the third highest in percentage gains, according to a tally by Bespoke Investment Group. From the trend's start, in 2009, through its latest high, on Aug. 7, the Standard & Poor's 500 has risen 267 percent.
But that's not all. By one standard -- the market's average daily movement, measured against its trend for that year -- stocks so far in 2017 are the steadiest they have been since 1965, when Lyndon B. Johnson was in the White House and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was leading an epochal civil rights march from Selma to Montgomery, Ala. On Wall Street that year, a young man named Warren Buffett gained effective control of a textile firm called Berkshire Hathaway, making it the vehicle for a legendary investing career.
"That was so long ago that there are very few people left who were active then and still actively trading now," said Salil Mehta, the statistician who performed that calculation (technically, he found the average absolute deviation of the S.&P. 500 index) at my request.
"It is difficult to appreciate how unusual 2017 is," Mr. Mehta said, "or to use the distant past to draw lessons about it." Clearly, though, neither then nor now, political turmoil had little or no effect on the pervasive calm in the stock market.
Mr. Mehta, the former director of research and analytics for the Treasury's Troubled Asset Relief Program and the federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, pointed to several other indicators of uncanny market placidity this year.
For example, the VIX index, widely known as Wall Street's gauge of fear, has remained very low, on a historical basis, despite recent spikes. Data from the Chicago Board Options Exchange shows that even when the VIX has risen this year, it has not even reached its average since 2004.
And despite occasional bursts of market-driven angst, the downturns so far in 2017 have been paltry. Ryan Detrick, a senior market strategist for LPL Financial, has found that the S.&P. 500 through Friday has not had a 5 percent decline, from peak to trough, since June 28, 2016. That sell-off, 6.1 percent over several days, occurred after Britain's surprise vote on June 23, 2016, to leave the European Union.
Amid the panic that week, I wrote that markets had already appeared to have bottomed: "One day, perhaps three or four months from now, they are likely to look even better, until the next crisis comes." That turns out to have been an understatement. There has not been another downturn that big since then, though there have been plenty of political crises. Going all the way back to 1950, Mr. Detrick has found, the current streak is the fourth longest in history without a 5 percent decline.
Other measurements show the same pattern. For the three weeks through Aug. 10, the closing levels of the S.&P. 500 never had a daily swing of more than 0.3 percent, Mr. Detrick said: "That never happened before in the history of the S.&P. 500." And for 2017 so far, the average daily trading range has been 0.55 percent, the lowest ever.
"We have been living in a very unusual world," Mr. Detrick said, "and I don't think we are going to stay here for very long."
Similarly, Mr. Mehta said that this stretch of smooth sailing has gone on for so long that it has become statistically improbable. That isn't a firm prediction of a decline because the future is uncertain. But, he said, it is quite likely that a stock market decline of at least 5 percent -- from peak to trough -- will be coming in the not-too-distant future.
"Mere reversion to the mean is likely," Mr. Mehta said. "From a probability standpoint, the run we've been on is very rare, and it's likely that we'll return to something more normal relatively soon."
Will there be a downturn big enough to derail the bull market? Of course. But, alas, no one knows when it will happen.
In traditional Wall Street parlance, a bull market ends and a bear begins with a drop of 20 percent from the market's last peak, which happens to have occurred on Aug. 7, when the S.&.P. closed at 2,480.91. The market has dropped 1.9 percent since then. It hasn't had a 3 percent decline since before the November election, in the longest such streak since 1995, Mr. Detrick said.
We are long overdue, he said, adding that he expected "a very healthy decline of 5 percent or more," which would be "a buying opportunity for people who have stayed out of the stock market." Stock valuations are stretched, he said, but when you factor in low interest rates and low inflation, current prices are reasonable, in his view.
"Bull markets don't die of old age, they die of excesses," Mr. Detrick said. And there is no indication, he added, that an end to the market's long-term rising trend is imminent.
Still, the stock market is linked, even if tenuously, to the real economy. And like the bull market, the economic recovery from the last recession has gone on for an extremely long time. The economic expansion in the United States is already the third longest since 1854, according to Alan Blinder, the Princeton economist, citing data from the National Bureau of Economic Research. If there is no recession until June 2019, he said, this will become the longest period without a recession.
One of these days, these various streaks will end. A big stock market decline could well precede and predict a recession. But barring a disastrous geopolitical, economic or financial shock -- there are plenty of possibilities, take your pick -- it is likely that both the bull market and the economic recovery will keep grinding on for a while.
But don't count on it. We are pushing our luck. Even if you believe in magic, the markets rarely stay calm and buoyant for such an exceedingly long time.

Full text: With a sweeping overhaul of the tax code on the horizon, two Senate Democrats believe this is the moment to broach the third rail of climate change policy: a carbon tax. The plan by the senators, Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island and Brian Schatz of Hawaii, to level a $49 per metric ton fee on greenhouse gas emissions is widely acknowledged as a long shot. But the lawmakers, along with climate activists and a cadre of conservative supporters, insist the tax reform is a way to create bipartisan support. The senators propose to use a portion of the estimated $2.1 trillion they anticipate in carbon tax revenue over the first 10 years to reduce the top marginal corporate tax income rate, something the White House has called for.
They also hope to have an ally in President Trump's economic adviser, Gary D. Cohn, who met in February with a prominent group of Republicans advocating a similar plan.
No Republican lawmaker has signed on to the Senate measure. Mr. Trump, who routinely proclaims his affection for coal, during the presidential campaign flatly rejected via Twitter a suggestion that he might put a price on carbon pollution. The senators steering the effort admit they haven't even broached a carbon tax directly with members of the administration, and the White House has distanced itself from the policy.
Yet even the fiercest critics of a carbon tax say they can't afford to dismiss the effort.
"What is that Taylor Swift song? We are never, ever, ever getting back together? This is never, ever, ever going to happen," said Grover Norquist, the anti-tax lobbyist and founder of Americans for Tax Reform. But, he added, the possibility of a carbon tax routinely re-emerges. "This time there is money for promoting that this idea might happen someday," he said.
Thomas J. Pyle, president of the Institute for Energy Research, which promotes fossil fuels, agreed. "It's so much revenue that it's always going to be on the table and it's always a threat," he said.
Amid concern that tax reform might be delayed because of the political turmoil caused by Mr. Trump's statement at a news conference Tuesday that "both sides" were to blame for violence over the weekend at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va., top White House officials asserted the president's words would not hamper the tax reform plan.
"We are going to hit the ground running, literally this month on tax reform," Cohn told reporters in Trump Tower on Tuesday after the president left the podium. Asked if the president's agenda is still on track, he said, "We are here to execute his agenda."
The carbon tax movement's biggest jolt came this year when a coalition of Republican elder statesmen, led by former Secretary of State James A. Baker III, made the case to the White House that a fee on the burning of fossil fuels coupled with a monthly dividend to American households would be good for the economy, as well as the planet. Those discussions are continuing, said Ted Halstead, founder of the Climate Leadership Council, a think tank dedicated to free market solutions to climate change, who has been working with the conservative leaders.
In the meantime, Senators Whitehouse and Schatz say, they have their eyes on the tax overhaul debate. The White House wants the corporate rate cut to 15 percent from its current 35 percent. Whether or not that is realistic, they say, getting even partway there will take bipartisan compromise.
The carbon tax bill they have proposed uses part of the revenue to reduce the marginal corporate income tax rate to 29 percent.
"There are only a handful of options in terms of generating revenue for broad-based tax reform, and they're all very close to dead on arrival. This is the one proposal that could attract a significant number of Democrats," Mr. Schatz said. He acknowledged, though, that using revenue to cut the corporate income tax rate could turn off some Democrats, too.
The legislation calls for the tax, which would increase annually by 2 percent, to be collected at its source -- at coal mines, oil refineries or ports of entry. The rest of the revenue would come back to taxpayers in an annual inflation-adjusted $550 refundable tax credit, or $1,100 for married couples filing jointly. Money would also be devoted to veterans and to coal country for job training programs.
The idea of a carbon tax dates to the 1920s, when the British economist Arthur Pigou observed that some goods had social costs that society ended up paying for -- like alcohol, or pollution. In the early 2000s economists and other supporters of taxing companies for the carbon they send into the atmosphere formed the Pigou Club in his honor.
Some conservative heavyweights, like Arthur Laffer, often called the father of supply-side economics, and Darren W. Woods, the chief executive of Exxon Mobil, have thrown their intellectual and political heft behind the idea. Economists argue that the revenue from a carbon tax could be used to reduce or eliminate income, payroll or other taxes. Some business leaders say it is preferable to onerous regulation or a cap-and-trade program.
Asked where a carbon tax stands in the administration's deliberations, a White House spokeswoman, Kelly Love, said in a statement, "We don't officially comment on legislation unless it's something we are actively supporting or is about to be considered in Congress."
Mr. Norquist and other opponents like Mr. Pyle say they welcome a debate on a carbon tax. They and others recalled that Democrats lost the House in the 1994 midterm elections in large part because President Bill Clinton proposed but failed to get passed a "B.T.U. tax" on fuels that would have raised energy costs.
A 2013 Congressional Budget Office analysis found that a carbon tax half as big as the one Mr. Whitehouse and Mr. Schatz propose would raise gasoline prices by 20 cents a gallon and electricity bills by 16 percent on average. Coal-heavy states would see even steeper price increases.
The idea that a national tax on carbon dioxide emissions could generate billions of dollars for ailing coal communities does not seem to have won over many lawmakers. Senate Democrats who recently wrote to Republican leaders laying out their conditions for bipartisan tax reform did not mention a carbon tax.
But supporters note that if the White House hopes to cut tax rates without raising the deficit, it will need to find new, taxable economic activity. So optimistic are Mr. Whitehouse and Mr. Schatz about winning bipartisan support that they unveiled their bill at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. (A representative was quick to note, though, that hosting the carbon tax debate was not an endorsement of the policy.)
Mr. Whitehouse insisted the Republican votes are there. They are just, for now, hiding, he said.
"There are Republicans willing to work with us, and not just a few," he said. "They just need the prospect of safe passage through the political kill zone."
Republican lawmakers, for their part, range from outright opposed to skeptical. Representative Mark Meadows, Republican of North Carolina, who leads the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said he did not support a carbon tax. Democrats have been pitching his office, however, and Mr. Meadows said one of his aides believed the idea has merit.
Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, was circumspect about a carbon tax. Congress, she noted, is an unpredictable place.
"I haven't heard anybody within the administration taking point on this, so my sense would be no. But things happen around here," she said. Ms. Murkowski once considered the idea of a carbon tax but in 2015 voted to prohibit a federal fee on emissions.
After the Senate's failure to pass health care legislation, pundits note that both Congress and Mr. Trump need a win.
"I won't say it's likely, but it's more likely than it has been in some time," said Eli Lehrer, president of the R Street Institute, a conservative think tank that supports a carbon tax. "And if the stars align perfectly, I could see a carbon tax happening."

Full text: President Trump is rattling the rest of the world, too. Having scared a lot of people last week with his bombast over North Korea, causing jitters about nuclear war, he threatened on Friday to use force to quell chaos in Venezuela. That threat poured fuel on the worsening conflict between President Nicolás Maduro and his opponents. It also unsettled people across Latin America, which has suffered a long history of American intervention. It's still not clear why Mr. Trump raised the subject of Venezuela in a discussion with reporters about North Korea, or what precisely he meant when he said, "We have many options for Venezuela, including a possible military option if necessary." Still, it seemed like another instance of reckless militaristic swagger by a president whose "America First" campaign rejected foreign entanglements, yet who in seven months has carried out the country's first missile strikes against Syrian forces and has expanded counterterrorism operations in Yemen, Somalia and Pakistan. He is also considering sending more troops to Afghanistan.
Venezuela, with possibly the world's largest oil reserves, had a chance to become one of South America's leading democracies. Mr. Maduro turned the country into an economic basket case and himself into a dictator. He modeled himself on his left-wing predecessor, Hugo Chávez, with excessive public spending that, coupled with mismanagement and falling oil prices, was unsustainable. The inflation rate for 2017 is estimated at 720 percent, and it is believed that 80 percent of Venezuelans live in poverty, some suffering from malnutrition and full-scale hunger. More than 120 people have died in several months of protests demanding Mr. Maduro's removal. Some analysts fear outright civil war.
In this environment, Mr. Trump's threat of military action is a lifeline for Mr. Maduro. Like other Venezuelan leaders, Mr. Maduro has used the United States to rally his people, often with specious warnings of American plots to invade. On Monday, thousands of government supporters rallied in Caracas to support Mr. Maduro and denounce Mr. Trump's "military option."
Regional leaders also responded to his threat. Juan Manuel Santos, the president of Colombia, said on Sunday, "The possibility of a military intervention shouldn't even be considered." The episode appears to have set back the progress made by President Barack Obama, who strengthened ties with South America by working cooperatively to resolve regional disputes.
Vice President Mike Pence, on a trip to the region, attempted to calm the outrage, saying in Buenos Aires on Tuesday that he was confident about reaching a "peaceable" solution for Venezuela through economic and diplomatic pressure on Mr. Maduro. But Mr. Pence also told NBC News on Monday, "We're simply not going to tolerate seeing Venezuela collapse into dictatorship."
The precipitous decline of Venezuela is not just a tragedy for its people, but a threat to regional stability. Mr. Trump should continue to toughen sanctions, but any lasting solution will be achieved only in concert with regional leaders.

Full text: Here's a look at what's coming up this week. ENERGY
An usual tariff petition could disrupt the solar market.
An unusual trade case that could upend the domestic solar market is set for a hearing on Tuesday before the United States International Trade Commission in Washington. Petitioners in the case -- two American affiliates of overseas solar equipment manufacturers -- are seeking steep tariffs on foreign-made cells and modules to counteract the low price of imports, often from Chinese manufacturers. Much of the domestic solar industry stands against the petitioners, as does one of the parent companies, which is Chinese. A number of proceedings could follow over the next few months. But the final decision could wind up with President Trump. Diane Cardwell
RETAIL
Home Depot is expected to report strong results.
After department stores revealed a string of lackluster earnings last week, Home Depot, one of the sturdiest retailers in America, will report results on Tuesday. The home improvement giant is expected to post strong profits, as it continues to ward off competition from Amazon. On Thursday, Walmart will report its results. Investors will look to see whether the nation's biggest retailer can continue to grow its e-commerce and grocery business amid intense competition. Michael Corkery
ECONOMY
The Fed's minutes may shed light on its interest rate debate.
The Federal Reserve will release minutes of its July 26 meeting on Wednesday afternoon, providing more details on the decision to reduce the central bank's $4.5 trillion in asset holdings. The Fed signaled at the meeting that it "expects to begin implementing its balance sheet normalization program relatively soon," with a gradual unwinding of the huge bond portfolio that it had accumulated under its quantitative easing programs. The minutes should also shed light on the internal debate over how much to raise the Fed's short-term interest rate target, and when, in light of inflation numbers that have continued to run below the 2 percent the Fed aims for. Neil Irwin
TRADE
In Nafta talks, the United States is likely to push for broader authority.
All the discussion about renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement finally will become a reality on Wednesday, when formal talks between the United States, Canada and Mexico begin in Washington. The first round could be tense at times, as Mr. Trump has called for changes to Nafta that would dramatically reduce the United States' trade deficits with its neighbors to the north and south. The Trump administration has promised "a much better deal" for Americans.
In laying out the administration's objectives last month, the United States trade representative said he would push to eliminate unfair subsidies and to give the nation broader authority to crack down on an influx of cheap products. Alan Rappeport
ECONOMY
Industrial production data may hold clues to economic momentum.
On Thursday at 9:15 a.m., the Federal Reserve will release the latest data on industrial production in July. Economists are looking for a rise of 0.2 percent, compared with a 0.4 percent increase in June. Manufacturing and mining have been showing signs of life lately, and this data may be an early indicator of economic momentum in the third quarter. Nelson D. Schwartz

Markets Halt a Three-Day Tumble

Full text: Gains among technology companies helped end a three-day losing streak for stocks on Friday, though the market ended with its worst weekly loss since March. The modest rebound came at the end of a turbulent week on Wall Street as escalating tensions between the United States and North Korea rattled global markets.
In the first four days of the week, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index swung from reaching its latest high to posting its biggest single-day drop in nearly three months.
The negative headlines provided many investors with an opportunity to pocket some of their recent gains following a string of record highs fueled by strong corporate earnings.
"It's been a bit of a roller coaster this week, with all the rhetoric between the U.S. and North Korea," said Jeffrey Kravetz, regional investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. "That did temporarily shake investors' complacency, but we think markets are ready to move higher in the back half of the year, and earnings and economic data are going to drive that."
The S.&P. 500 rose 3.11 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,441.32. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 14.31 points, or 0.1 percent, to 21,858.32. The Nasdaq added 39.68 points, or 0.6 percent, to 6,256.56.
The recovery fit a recent pattern of investors using dips to put more money in stocks.
Despite the past week's decline, the major indexes are in positive territory so far this year, led by the Nasdaq, which is up 16.2 percent. The S.&P. 500 is up 9 percent, while the Dow is up 10.6 percent.
Tensions between the United States and North Korea continued to simmer early Friday. On Twitter, President Trump warned of military action "should North Korea act unwisely," noting that the United States is "locked and loaded."
Still, there were fewer signs of anxiousness in the markets on Friday. Bond and gold prices, traditional havens for nervous investors, were little changed, and the VIX, a measure of how much volatility investors expect in stocks, fell 3.3 percent following a 44.4 percent jump the day before. It is still the highest it has been since May.
Investors also drew encouragement from new government data showing that inflation at the consumer level inched higher last month. A 0.1 percent increase in consumer prices in July suggests that the Federal Reserve may be less likely to raise interest rates next month.
Seagate Technology, a digital storage company, gained 2.3 percent after the activist investor ValueAct disclosed that it had acquired a 7.2 percent stake. Seagate shares rose 74 cents to $32.29.
Traders sold off financial stocks as speculation rose that the Fed will decide to hold off on raising interest rates next month. Higher interest rates can help bolster banks' revenue from loans. Regions Financial shed 23 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $14.07.
The department store chain J. C. Penney sank 16.6 percent after it reported quarterly results that fell short of Wall Street expectations. The company also said sales at its established stores declined for the fourth straight quarter. The stock lost 78 cents to $3.93.
Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note slipped to 2.19 percent from 2.20 percent late Thursday.
Benchmark United States crude rose 23 cents to settle at $48.82 a barrel on the on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, used to price international oils, rose 20 cents to $52.10 a barrel in London.
Gold added $4 to settle at $1,287.70 an ounce. Silver gained 1 cent to $17.07 an ounce. Copper rose 1 cent to $2.91 a pound.

Full text: CORRECTION APPENDED. HUNTINGTON, W.Va. -- In a sleek laboratory at Marshall University last month, four high school teachers hunched over a miniature steam-electric boiler, a tabletop replica of the gigantic machinery found in power plants.
They hooked the boiler to a small, whirring generator and tinkered with valves and knobs, looking for the most efficient way to turn coal, natural gas, nuclear or solar energy into electricity.
The teachers, who were attending a summer training program, are helping West Virginia in another kind of transformation. Long one of the poorest states, it is now leading the way in turning vocational education from a Plan B for underachieving students into what policy makers hope will be a fuel source for the state's economic revival.
Simulated workplaces, overseen by teachers newly trained in important state industries like health, coal and even fracking, are now operating in schools across the state. Students punch a time clock, are assigned professional roles like foreman or safety supervisor, and are even offered several vacation days of their choice in addition to regular school breaks. (Many take time off during deer hunting season.)
Traditional math and English teachers have been reassigned to technical high schools, to make sure students on the vocational track still gain reading, writing and math skills.
And this fall, students enrolled in simulated workplaces will need to participate in one of the program's boldest elements: random drug testing.
Given the extent of the state's opioid crisis, employers "wouldn't take anything we were doing seriously until we passed that hurdle," said Barry Crist, principal of the Fayette Institute of Technology in Oak Hill.
West Virginia's heavy push on vocational education comes as leaders of both parties have talked about making it a priority, a shift from the No Child Left Behind era of education reform, in which college for everyone was often the goal. In 2015, fewer than half of 25- to 34-year-olds nationwide had earned an associate or bachelor's degree, according to census figures.
"Vocational training is a great thing," President Trump said a week before Election Day. "We're going to start it up big league." In June, he signed an executive order that redirected federal job training funds toward apprenticeships, in which students learn skills at actual work sites.
Democrats, too, are talking about vocational training. The agenda they introduced in July, "A Better Deal," speaks of increasing support for "technical education that leads to a good job."
But Mr. Trump's budget calls for $166 million in cuts, a 15 percent reduction, in Perkins Act grants to the states, the government's main funding stream for technical education in high school and college. The House passed a bipartisan reauthorization of the Perkins program in June, but the bill has not moved forward in the Senate. Even if it passes, the legislation will represent a tweak to the program, not a substantial new commitment of the type Mr. Trump and Democrats have touted.
When it comes to technical education, the United States is an outlier compared with other developed nations. Only 6 percent of American high school students were enrolled in a vocational course of study, according to a 2013 Department of Education report. In the United Kingdom, 42 percent were on the vocational track; in Germany, it was 59 percent; in the Netherlands, 67 percent; and in Japan, 25 percent.
"We are so focused on academic routes as opposed to other routes that can be high quality," said Mary Alice McCarthy, director of the Center on Education and Skills at New America and a former official at the Education and Labor Departments. "There's a desperate need."
West Virginia has especially big challenges transitioning students to life after high school. According to the Social Science Research Council, 17 percent of the state's young adults are "disconnected," neither working nor in school, the second-highest rate among states, behind only New Mexico.
But in few other states have the changes in vocational education -- now rebranded as "career and technical education" -- been as dramatic. Thirty-seven percent of West Virginia high school seniors completed a technical course of study in 2016, up from 18 percent in 2010.
Many are now in simulated workplaces where they learn to work with stethoscopes, welding torches and drafting tables as well as more sophisticated technology.
As an eighth grader, Dillon Brasse, who will be a senior this fall, planned to enter the vocational track to learn masonry. But on a tour of the Fayette Institute, he was fascinated by the computer-assisted drafting classroom, where students work with a 3-D printer, a laser engraver, a vinyl cutter and professional computer software like AutoDesk's Inventor, which is used in product development.
In his classroom, Dillon said, music plays and students are permitted breaks throughout the day, like employees at a real work site. He and his classmates have designed and produced objects like saltshakers and fidget spinners, the faddish hand-held toys.
"It's a great experience," Dillon said, because "you're treated like an adult."
That treatment now includes drug testing. West Virginia policy makers say such testing prepares students for the work force, where employers are increasingly checking for drug use, though the American Academy of Pediatrics opposes mandatory testing, citing a "lack of solid evidence" for its effectiveness in helping teenagers avoid substances.
Rachel Peal, who graduated this spring from the pre-engineering simulated workplace program at the Fayette Institute, said the protocol kicked up little protest among her peers. They are well aware that opioid users can't get or hold down jobs, she said.
"A lot of kids and their families saw the struggle," she said. "It's an epidemic here."
Ron Foster, president of Foster Supply Inc., an 80-employee construction and fabrication firm, has hired eight graduates of the state's high school simulated workplace program over the past two years. They can earn as much as $15 per hour doing jobs such as welding and machinery repair.
Compared with previous hires, this group is more punctual and focused on building a career, Mr. Foster said. "If you're dedicated enough to go through that program, you're more apt to do a good, quality job," he said.
But far from being strictly a job training program for teenagers, classes like Advanced Career Energy and Power, the four-course sequence for which teachers were training at Marshall University, require math and physics instruction as rigorous as in the College Board's Advanced Placement track. Of the four teachers tinkering with the miniature boiler, three came from traditional math and science departments.
The hope is to prepare students for higher-skilled work. In the fracking industry, for example, they might qualify for jobs in equipment maintenance or environmental compliance instead of laying pipeline, an entry-level and sometimes dangerous job.
About half of the state's technical-track graduates go on to two- or four-year colleges. Dillon Brasse, for example, is now planning to pursue a bachelor's degree in engineering or architecture.
"There's so much technical information that's needed today," said Jeri Matheney, communications director for Appalachian Power, which runs coal, natural gas and hydropower plants in West Virginia. "Where we counted on just on-the-job training 50 years ago, that has changed."
The classes mimic the workplace in another way, one perhaps not intended. According to federal data from the 2015-16 school year, 90 percent of West Virginia high school technical students concentrating in science fields were male, while 89 percent of those concentrating in health fields were female.
And economists debate whether better vocational education, at either the high school or college level, can be a large-scale fix for underemployment. After all, if firms aren't hiring, even a highly skilled worker will struggle to land a job.
The energy sector is especially cyclical, a challenge for the Appalachian region. Nationwide, the number of jobs in coal and gas fell by more than a quarter between 2014 and 2016, and hiring is only now beginning to creep back up.
Still, West Virginia educators and policy makers are believers in the "skills gap" hypothesis.
Kathy D'Antoni, the state director for career and technical education since 2010, said a better-educated work force would attract new types of jobs to the state. And she would like to see more support from Washington targeted toward struggling rural states. West Virginia delivered the largest pro-Trump majority in the November election, a margin of 42 percentage points.
Adjusted for inflation, West Virginia's funding through the Perkins Act has been flat since the program's inception in 1984, according to the state. Asked about the president's proposed cuts to Perkins, Liz Hill, a spokeswoman for the federal Department of Education, said innovation in career and technical education would continue locally through "public-private partnerships" between schools and industry.
Ms. D'Antoni said she appreciated the attention Mr. Trump had given to vocational education. But, she said, "I want to see the action."
Correction: August 15, 2017, Tuesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Because of an editing error, an article on Friday about West Virginia's efforts to focus on vocational training as a way to help its flagging economy described Donald J. Trump's victory margin in that state incorrectly. While Mr. Trump won his highest percentage of the vote in West Virginia, the state did not give him his greatest victory margin. (That was Wyoming.)

Full text: George Bundy Smith, a former civil rights activist who in 2004 wrote the benchmark decision by New York's highest court that, in effect, voided the state's death penalty, died on Saturday at his home in Harlem. He was 80. His death was confirmed by his son, George Bundy Smith Jr. No cause was specified.
As the third black person appointed to the state's highest court, the Court of Appeals, Judge Smith wrote the 4-3 ruling declaring unconstitutional a central provision of a capital punishment bill that had been championed a decade earlier by the state's incoming Republican governor, George E. Pataki.
While Judge Smith was considered a liberal lion, he also repeatedly demonstrated his independence as a jurist. In 2006, he joined the majority in rejecting the argument by gay and lesbian couples that denying them the right to marry violated the state Constitution. For nearly a century, the court said, the New York State Legislature intended to limit marriage to a union between a man and a woman, and had a rational basis for doing so.
In 2011, the Legislature legalized same-sex marriage, a right later upheld by the United States Supreme Court.
In almost three decades on the bench, Judge Smith opposed television coverage in most courtrooms. He temporarily upheld the city's right to hospitalize a mentally disturbed homeless woman involuntarily. (Another judge released her after trial.)
He ruled that defendants in New York City had to be arraigned within 24 hours of their arrest, that the Legislature could not arbitrarily kill bills it had already approved, and that the state had shortchanged New York City's schools. He also awarded back pay to a police officer who had been fired because she posed nude for a magazine.
In 1999, Judge Smith insisted that Ralph J. Tortorici was mentally incompetent and should not have been tried -- without a competency hearing -- on charges of holding 35 students and a professor hostage in a State University of New York classroom in Albany. Six months after the Court of Appeals upheld the conviction, Mr. Tortorici hanged himself in a psychiatric hospital.
"George Bundy Smith had the independence and the courage among all his colleagues to stick his neck out and say that this man should not have been prosecuted," Prof. Vincent M. Bonventre of Albany Law School wrote in an email.
The 2004 capital punishment decision was the fourth time the Court of Appeals had overturned a death sentence since a new statute was passed in 1995 to overcome the constitutional shortcomings of earlier measures.
Judge Smith had foreshadowed his doubts about the statute's legality in 2003, when he expressed concerns that in most states the death penalty had been imposed disproportionately on blacks.
"New York is no less deserving of a badge of shame for the role race played in capital punishment," he wrote at the time.
The ruling written by Judge Smith directly affected four inmates on death row, including Stephen LaValle, a former Long Island roofer who raped and killed a schoolteacher, Cynthia Quinn, in 1997, and whose appeal was before the court.
Writing for the slim majority, Judge Smith affirmed the conviction, but said a so-called deadlock provision unique to New York had coerced jurors in the penalty phase of deliberations to vote for death. According to that provision, if a jury failed to decide between death and life without parole, the judge would have to impose a sentence that would qualify the defendant for parole after as little as 20 years.
"The deadlock instruction," Judge Smith wrote for the majority, "gives rise to an unconstitutionally palpable risk that one or more jurors who cannot bear the thought that a defendant may walk the streets again after serving 20 to 25 years will join jurors favoring death in order to avoid the deadlock sentence."
The court concluded that "under the present statute, the death penalty may not be imposed." The Legislature never revised the law to pass judicial muster. New York last executed an inmate in 1963.
George Bundy Smith was born on April 7, 1937, in New Orleans to the Rev. Sidney R. Smith Sr. and the former Beatrice Bundy, a teacher.
Raised in segregated Washington, he won a scholarship to Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., where he was the only black student in his class. In 1959 he earned a bachelor's degree in history from Yale, where he was one of the few black students. With his twin sister, Inez, he graduated from Yale Law School in 1962. He later received a master's and a doctorate from New York University.
In 1961, before graduation, he enlisted in the civil rights movement at the urging of the Rev. William Sloane Coffin Jr., the Yale chaplain. He was one of about 10 protesters, including Dr. Coffin, the Rev. Ralph Abernathy and the Rev. Wyatt Tee Walker, who were arrested when they ordered coffee at a whites-only lunch counter in the Montgomery, Ala., bus terminal. (Their convictions on civil disobedience charges were overturned in 1965 by the United States Supreme Court.)
Observing Mr. Smith studiously review his class notes during the dangerous Freedom Ride, Dr. Coffin, by his account, marveled at the young man's equanimity -- to which Mr. Smith replied, "Sticks and stones can break my bones but law exams will kill me."
As a newly minted lawyer, Mr. Smith joined the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund and helped the civil rights lawyer Constance Baker Motley draft briefs for James Meredith's successful challenge to the University of Mississippi's refusal to admit black students.
He then became a law secretary to several New York judges and served as the administrator of Model Cities, a federally funded antipoverty program in New York City. He was appointed and then elected to the Civil Court in 1975; elected to the Supreme Court, where he sat from 1980 to 1986; and then appointed to the Appellate Division. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo appointed him to the Court of Appeals in 1992.
At the time, Guido Calabresi, the dean of Yale Law School, who had taught him torts in 1959, said: "I couldn't tell you very much about his politics, and that's the way it should be. George is not doctrinaire, and he is known for considering each case on its merits."
Judge Smith and his wife, the former Alene Lohman Jackson, a retired professor at Hunter College of the City University of New York, wrote "You Decide!: Applying the Bill of Rights to Real Cases" in 1992. She and his son, a television sportscaster for WFLD in Chicago, survive him, as do Judge Smith is survived by his daughter, Beth Beatrice Smith, a college professor; his sister, Inez, a senior judge on the District of Columbia Court of Appeals; his brother, Dr. Sidney R. Smith; and two grandchildren.
Governor Pataki, who was vexed by Judge Smith's 2004 opinion in the death-penalty case, did not appoint him to a second term in 2006.
After leaving the court, as a partner in the Manhattan law firm of Chadbourne & Parke, Judge Smith sued the state in 2007 on behalf of judges who argued that because they had not received a pay raise since 1999, inflation had, in effect, unconstitutionally diminished their compensation. In 2008, a State Supreme Court justice ordered the Legislature to grant the state's 1,250 judges a raise.
It was not the first time Judge Smith had defended the independence of the judicial branch. Responding to the criticism generated by the death-penalty decision, he acknowledged that second-guessing court decisions is a normal part of the legal process.
"It is the attacks on the judiciary itself which I think are cause for concern," he said. "I think that judges have to do the job that they have been selected and appointed to do, and can't fear the criticism of anyone."

Full text: ELDORET, Kenya -- Fake news. Odd plot twists. Tit-for-tat accusations. One candidate calling another "crooked." Those political phenomena, familiar to voters in the United States and Europe, have surfaced in Kenya ahead of a tightly contested presidential election on Tuesday. But in a country with a history of election violence, the addition of such toxic behavior has further fanned fears about whether the country can pull off a credible and peaceful vote.
Two previous elections were marred by violence amid widespread claims that they had been rigged; in 2007, the disputed vote plunged Kenya into bloodshed that left at least 1,300 people dead and 600,000 displaced from their homes.
Just in the past week, there was a break-in at the country estate of the vice president, which ended after an 18-hour siege. Then, a senior election official in charge of crucial voting technology was found dead. His body, disposed of in a forest outside Nairobi, the capital, showed signs of torture.
In addition, the military confirmed the existence of a document that the opposition party claimed revealed plans to rig the vote in favor of President Uhuru Kenyatta. But the military then backtracked, saying that the document was being "quoted out of context" and that the military was "apolitical."
In the latest development, just two days before Election Day, the main opposition coalition, the National Super Alliance, accused Mr. Kenyatta of ordering an armed raid on one of its tallying centers. The accusation was reported by some media outlets but dismissed by others as false.
The details of all those events remain hazy and unconfirmed, spawning fears and conspiracy theories among Kenyans already nervous about Tuesday's vote. Whether those reports are false or simply shoddy journalism, 90 percent of Kenyans surveyed in a report in July said they had seen or heard deliberately fake news, according to GeoPoll, a polling service. This included stories said to have been produced by the BBC and CNN. One news article had the headline "Crooked Raila," referring to Raila Odinga, who is running against Mr. Kenyatta. The president's team is reported to have enlisted Cambridge Analytica, the big-data company that worked on President Trump's campaign.
"There is an ecosystem of fake news around this election," said Alphonce Shiundu, editor of Africa Check, a fact-checking organization. "Kenyans really don't know what the truth is."
Misleading reports combined with a shaky trust in the electoral process -- a third of Kenyans have "no trust at all" in the fairness of the electoral commission, according to a nationwide opinion poll -- could set off a rerun of the violence seen a decade ago.
"This makes me worried," Mr. Shiundu said.
Fearful of clashes erupting, thousands of people have already fled major cities, including Nakuru and Eldoret, in the Rift Valley region of Kenya, where some of the worst postelection violence took place a decade ago. Shortly after the 2007 election, about 50 people were burned alive as they sought refuge in a church near the city, in western Kenya. Bus tickets from Nairobi to rural cities are twice the usual price, and flights are overbooked, according to travel agencies.
"After what happened in 2007, no one wants the same," said Vanity Kosgi, 37, a politician in Eldoret. "People learn."
Alfred Agisu, 35, the leader of a scraggly troupe of young drummers in Eldoret, urged residents not to succumb to violence. "We make music to preach peace," Mr. Agisu said.
In a contest that will cost at least $1 billion, according to Kenya's treasury, more than 19.6 million registered voters will choose hundreds of legislative candidates across the country, in addition to the president and vice president.
"Quite a lot is at stake," said Justin Willis, professor of history at Durham University in England and an expert on Kenyan politics. "Everyone is working hard to win. People have invested so much -- and so much money -- that they need to recoup their losses, right up to the president."
Facing no limits on campaign financing, politicians have spared no expense. They have showered voters with money and even hired helicopters for their campaigns. The common belief is that once voted in, lawmakers, whose official salaries are 25 times higher than those of average Kenyans, will redistribute some of that wealth to their supporters.
Eldoret, for example, is a stronghold of Vice President William Ruto. It has some of the best roads in Kenya. Its city center is a hive of businesses and hotels. There is little garbage on the streets. Outside town, lush cornfields and banana forests stretch as far as the eye can see. (Mr. Ruto's country estate, which was breached by an unknown assailant who was later shot dead by members of the security forces, has a well-manicured garden decorated with pink bougainvillea.)
If the election is transparent and credible, it will send a powerful message to Kenya's neighbors, where longtime leaders are holding on to power, as is the case in Ethiopia, Uganda and Rwanda, or have taken a despotic turn, as in Tanzania.
President Kenyatta, 55, who leads the Jubilee Party, will face off against Mr. Odinga, 72, a former prime minister who leads the National Super Alliance. Both men are wealthy scions of post-independence leaders, and their families have largely dominated Kenyan politics for decades.
Mr. Odinga, who is running for a fourth time, says he was robbed of victory in the previous two contests. In 2013, Mr. Kenyatta won by a tiny margin, prompting Mr. Odinga to ask the Supreme Court to invalidate the election. Mr. Odinga is now rousing supporters by warning that this year's election could also be stolen, which critics say is an incitement to violence.
Mr. Kenyatta and Mr. Odinga were virtually tied in recent polls, but neither is drawing more than 50 percent. They are running on similar platforms -- economic development -- and have mostly appealed to voters based on ethnic affiliation.
The Kikuyus and Kalenjins, who make up a large chunk of Kenya's population, are mainly supporting Mr. Kenyatta. The Luos, Luhyas, Kambas and other smaller ethnic groups are backing Mr. Odinga.
For most Kenyans, unemployment and the high cost of living are the dominant issues, intertwined with deep-rooted ethnic allegiances, which were entrenched under Britain's colonial rulers, who pursued a policy of divide and rule.
Although the economy has been growing at an annual rate of 5 percent in recent years, inflation, partly caused by drought, is whittling away at Kenya's fragile middle class and creating a vast underclass. Many Kenyans cannot afford to buy staple foods or pay school fees. Electricity and water shortages are common. Youth unemployment is high.
"What do you want us to do, steal?" asked Vincent Losano, an unemployed man in Eldoret. "We need jobs."
Kenyans, still smarting from past violence, are hopeful that this year will be different. One reason is that the two ethnic groups that fought each other in 2007 and 2008 -- the Kikuyus and the Kalenjins -- are now in the same camp. (President Kenyatta is a Kikuyu; his running mate, Mr. Ruto, is a Kalenjin.)
Many Kenyans interviewed for this article also expressed optimism that, despite the gruesome murder of the election official, the vote would be fair and credible -- as long as the technology did not fail. Kenya will be using biometric technology to identify voters and transmit results electronically, which should diminish the chances of fraud.
In June, KPMG, the auditing firm enlisted by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission, recommended that more than 92,000 dead voters be removed from the registration rolls.
Before his death, the election official, Christopher Msando, reassured the public that the collection and tallying of votes was watertight. The commission, he said, had invested in satellite technology in case phone networks failed, as well as backups. It even ordered, for each of the country's 40,883 polling stations, more technology kits than necessary to identify voters and transmit the results.
There are other reasons for optimism. "A lot of work has gone into institutions, at the grass-roots level," said Marietje Schaake, who leads the European Union's Election Observation Mission. "You have a new Constitution, and that has put in place checks and balances. These are the kind of steps that have been meaningful compared to even five years ago."
Candidates who are not affiliated with any party or driven by ethnic interests have also started to emerge.
Boniface Mwangi, 34, a photojournalist and activist who gained prominence for his work documenting electoral violence a decade ago, formed a party and has become popular on social media sites. He is the leading candidate for a seat in Parliament representing Starehe, a constituency in Nairobi.
Mr. Mwangi said voting habits were starting to change, especially among young people, who make up more than half the electorate and who, he said, "are tired of party and tribal politics." He said that by the next election, in 2022, he expected the dominance of the two political families to have diminished.
Kenyans, he said, are beginning to pay more attention to economic issues than to ethnic and party loyalties. "When they get even more broke they will start to look at actual ideas," he said.
Mr. Mwangi said that a decade ago, when he traveled around Kenya taking photographs of the violence, he was struck by haunting images of "the poor killing the poor."
"The poor should be smarter," he said. "They shouldn't die for Boniface Mwangi. They shouldn't die for Raila Odinga. They shouldn't die for Uhuru Kenyatta."

Full text: Here's a look at what's coming up this week. OIL INDUSTRY
Talks to enforce production cuts aim to push prices higher.
Officials from oil-producing countries, including Saudi Arabia and Russia, are planning to meet in Abu Dhabi on Monday and Tuesday to discuss ways to increase compliance with the production cuts they agreed to last year. The cuts were aimed at bolstering prices, which are now about $52 a barrel for Brent crude. The talks could raise pressure on two major producers for the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Iraq and the United Arab Emirates, which are reported to be producing well over their quotas. The group, which includes both OPEC members and nonmembers, may also change its focus to exports, which are easier to monitor than output. Compliance, though, may not be the group's main problem. The impact of the production cuts has been undermined by rising production from Nigeria and Libya, OPEC members that are exempt from the quotas, and the United States. Stanley Reed
MEDIA
If Disney's past is a guide, its August report could bring big news.
In recent years, August earnings have been newsy for Disney. In 2015, the entertainment conglomerate acknowledged that subscriptions to ESPN were declining, sending media stocks plummeting. Last August, Disney unveiled a $1 billion minority stake in BamTech, a company that handles video streaming for HBO and Major League Baseball, as well as a coming ESPN service. So Disney could be poised to set off some fireworks on Tuesday when it announces fiscal third-quarter earnings after the close of trading.
The numbers will probably be soft, especially at ESPN -- the only division that Wall Street truly cares about -- because of $400 million in added costs from a new N.B.A. contract. Costs at Disney's theme park unit are also expected to soar, in part because of the opening of "Avatar"-themed rides in Florida.
When Disney has bumpy quarters, it tends to try to soften the landing by making buzzy announcements. Could Disney have an acquisition up its sleeve? Or maybe, at long last, a succession plan? Brooks Barnes
TECHNOLOGY
Snap, losing momentum, will deliver its second earnings report.
Snap, the company best known for its Snapchat messaging app, will deliver its second-ever earnings report on Thursday. When the company went public in March, investors paid $17 a share to own a piece of the hot start-up and made it the most valuable tech public offering since Facebook. But two months later, the company reported decelerating user growth, a $2.2 billion loss and earnings that missed Wall Street estimates for nearly every financial metric. Investors lost interest in the company, and the stock dropped to about $13 a share. Investors will closely monitor the company's financial update for signs that user and revenue growth have improved.

COMMODITIES
Eyes are on results from Glencore and Noble Group after hard times.
Analysts will watch first-half results from the Swiss trading and mining giant Glencore on Thursday for signs of the extent of its recovery from the pounding it took from falling commodities prices in 2015. Glencore has eased investor concerns by selling assets and cutting debt. With its share price regaining much of its previous buoyancy, the company is back on the acquisition trail.
Noble Group, a Hong Kong-based commodities firm that grew too fast, will probably tell a different story on Thursday. Once considered the largest commodity trader in Asia, Noble has already said it will report a loss of as much as $1.8 billion for the second quarter as it sells businesses in an effort to survive. Stanley Reed
ECONOMY
A slight rise in July prices is expected in a Labor Dept. update.
On Friday at 8:30 a.m., the Labor Department will release its reading on the Consumer Price Index for July. Economists estimate that overall prices rose 0.2 percent last month, with the same 0.2 percent increase for the core index that excludes the volatile food and energy sectors. The C.P.I. and inflation have been tame in recent months, as lower gas prices and weaker auto sales have restrained the growth in overall prices. Nelson D. Schwartz

Full text: At the end of last month, the International Monetary Fund downgraded its forecast for economic growth in the United States. Where the I.M.F. previously predicted the economy would grow at a rate of 2.3 percent in 2017 and 2.5 percent in 2018, it now expects 2.1 percent growth in both years. The reason? An uncertain and insufficiently expansionary economic environment linked to the chaos in Washington. Yes, the stock market has been strong and unemployment is down. But Donald Trump, friend of business, may be costing us growth, a key indicator of economic health.
The I.M.F. forecast is a reminder that ill-advised policy isn't the only way politics can interfere with growth. Instability can also slow things down.
Macroeconomists have long pondered how growth might be affected by features of the political system. Mostly an issue -- until now -- in the developing world, instability is thought to hinder growth by generating uncertainty that scares off investors and makes firms risk-averse. Instability also gives politicians a short-term view of things: If they can't be sure they or their parties will be involved in governance in the future, they won't commit to economic policies with long-term yield.
In a 1992 paper, the economist Alberto Alesina and colleagues tested these suppositions by looking at data on 113 countries from 1950 to 1982. A challenge in estimating the effect of instability on economic growth is that causality may run in the opposite direction: Low growth, and the accompanying sense of economic malaise, can lead to political disruption, rather than vice versa. After addressing this problem statistically, the researchers discovered that growth does tend to be slower when nations are politically unstable -- when governments verge on collapse or pinball from one ideological extreme to another.
More recently, the economists Ari Aisen and Francisco José Veiga examined 169 countries from 1960 to 2004. They gauged political instability by how often a new head of government was installed or more than half of the cabinet was changed out (or both). The greater the frequency of these changes, they found, the less overall investment there tended to be in physical capital like factories, and the lower the rate of growth.
The United States isn't an unstable Third World republic. But with a White House plagued by remarkably high staff turnover, and with constitutional crises lurking around every corner, the country and economy aren't exuding predictability either. If you were a judicious chief executive, you might be more restrained in pushing to expand amid the political turmoil, whatever the administration's interest in cutting regulatory red tape and slashing corporate taxes.
If the United States achieves the growth rate now projected by the I.M.F., it won't be terrible. But it won't be anything like the productivity spurts that policy makers and the public grew accustomed to in the second half of the 20th century. A vigorous, expanding economy meant jobs, reliably filled tax coffers, real recovery from downturns and continual improvement in the quality of life. Today, more modest growth rates have become the new normal.
There are several schools of economic thought on why growth has been in the doldrums -- but unfortunately, few offer solutions that are viable in an atmosphere of political instability.
For example, Lawrence Summers, the Treasury secretary under Bill Clinton, has developed a theory called "secular stagnation." The core idea is that the advanced economies of the world, including the United States, have entered a phase where there is too much saving and not enough new investment, keeping interest rates and inflation lower than they should be.
Mr. Summers points out that it costs a lot less to start a company in the internet age than when the only way to make money was through manufacturing. So there's less investment demand.
With a nod to the New Deal economist Alvin Hansen, who wrote about the relationship between population size and interest rates, Mr. Summers notes as well that population growth in Europe and the United States has steeply declined. Without new workers and consumers coming onto the rolls, there's an upper limit to domestic profit-making opportunities.
Mr. Summers believes there's a way out of the low-growth trap. He argues for a major debt-financed infrastructure spending program, coupled with tax reform, policies to address rising inequality (since when income gains go almost entirely to those at the top, it's hard to get a broad-based rise in consumer demand) and efforts to counter protectionist trade practices.
The thing is, nothing like what he proposes will be possible so long as we have a president whose inflammatory language, egregious actions and administrative incompetence continue to alienate voters and members of Congress. President Trump campaigned for infrastructure spending, but at this point neither Democrats or Republicans are likely to get completely on board. As for the other pro-growth suggestions, the president and his cabinet of billionaires couldn't care less about inequality and seem to be gunning for a trade war with China. And it's anyone's guess whether Mr. Trump has the discipline to negotiate corporate tax reform.
The bottom line is that while Wall Street is happy for the moment, the United States economy isn't reaching its full potential. A tumultuous Trump administration will have a hard time getting us there.

When Will the Tech Bubble Burst?

Full text: At the height of a market mania in 1967, the author George Goodman captured the mood perfectly, comparing it to a surreal party that ends only when "black horsemen" burst through the doors and cut down all the revelers who remain. "Those who leave early are saved, but the ball is so splendid no one wants to leave while there is still time. So everybody keeps asking -- what time is it? But none of the clocks have hands." Every decade since, the global markets have relived this party. In the late 1960s the mania was for the "nifty 50" American companies like Disney and McDonald's, which had been the "go-go" stocks of that decade. In the late 1970s it was for natural resources, from gold to oil. In the late 1980s it was stocks in Japan, and in the late 1990s it was the dot-com boom. Last decade, investors flocked to mortgage-backed securities and big emerging markets from Brazil to Russia. In every case, many partygoers were still in the market when the crash came.
Today, tech mania is resurgent. Investors are again glancing at a clock with no hands -- and dismissing the risk. The profitless start-ups that were wiped out in the dot-com crash have consolidated into an oligopoly composed of leading survivors such as Google and Apple. These are giants with real earnings, yet signs of a irrational euphoria are growing.
One is pitchmen bundling investments with very different outlooks into a single package. Last decade they bundled Brazil, Russia, India and China to sell as the BRICs. More recently they packaged Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google as FANG, then, as names and prospects shifted, subbed in Alphabet, Apple and Microsoft to make Faama. Others are hyping the hottest tech companies in China as BAT, for Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent. Whatever the mix, acronym mania is usually a sign of bubbly thinking.
Seven of the world's 10 most valuable companies are in the tech sector, matching the late 1999 peak. As the American stock market keeps marching to new highs -- the Dow hit 22,000 this week -- the gains are increasingly concentrated in the big tech stocks. The bulls say it is inevitable that Apple will become the first trillion-dollar company.
No matter how surreal the endgame, booms tend to begin with real innovation. In the past, manias have been triggered by excitement about canals, the telegraph and the automobile. But not since the advent of railroads incited market booms in the 1830s and 1840s has the world seen back-to-back booms like the dot-com bubble of the 1990s and the one we are in now.
The dot-com era saw the rise of big companies that were building the nuts and bolts of the internet -- including Dell, Microsoft, Cisco and Intel -- and of start-ups that promised to tap its revolutionary potential. The current boom lacks a popular name because the innovations -- from the internet of things to artificial intelligence and machine learning -- are sprawling and hard to label. If there is a single thread, it is the expanding capacity to harness data, which the Alibaba founder, Jack Ma, calls the "electricity of the 21st century."
Market excitement about authentic technology innovations enters the manic phase when stock prices rise faster than justified by underlying economic growth. Since the crisis of 2008, the United States economy has been recovering at the rate of around 2 percent, roughly half the rate seen for much of the past century. The areas of growth are limited in this environment. Oil's not very euphoric, with prices depressed, while regulators are forcing banks to keep the music down. In the most direct echo of 1999, technology is once again seen as the best party in town.
>
It is true that prices today are not quite as widely overvalued as in 1999. Large technology stocks are up 350 percent this decade, the low end of the range for the hot stocks from earlier booms, which saw gains of 300 to 1,900 percent. Only a few select technology companies -- mainly the internet giants -- are trading close to the valuations of the dot-com era, when the average price-to-earnings ratio for tech companies hit 50. The average ratio for that sector today is 18.
However, the scale of today's tech boom is not readily visible because much of the investment action has moved into the hands of big private players. In 1999, nearly 550 start-ups went public, and after many ended in disaster, the government tightened regulation of public companies. In part to avoid that red tape, this year only 11 tech companies have gone public. Many are raising money instead from venture capitalists or private equity funds. Venture capitalists have poured more than $60 billion into the technology sector every year for the past three years -- the highest flows since the peak in 2000 -- and private equity investors say there has never been a better time to raise money.
These new private funding channels are creating "unicorns," companies that haven't gone public but are valued at $1 billion or more. Unicorns barely existed in 1999. Now there are more than 260 worldwide, with technology companies dominating the list. And if signs emerge that the privately owned unicorns are faltering, the value of publicly owned tech companies is not likely to hold up either.
We can never know when the end will come. Still, there are three critical signals to watch for.
The first is regulation. The tech giants are seen today as monopolizing internet search and commerce, and they are angling to take over industries such as publishing and automobiles, raising alarms at antitrust agencies in Europe and the United States. Fear that new internet technologies are doing more to waste time and brainpower than to increase productivity has already provoked a backlash in China, where officials recently criticized online gaming as "electronic heroin." A regulatory crackdown on tech giants as either monopolies or productivity destroyers could pop the allure of tech stocks.
The other signals are more familiar. Going back to the "nifty 50" stocks of the 1960s, nearly every big market mania ended after central banks tightened monetary policy and many people who had borrowed to get in the game found themselves in trouble. The dot-com bubble peaked in 2000, after the Federal Reserve had increased interest rates multiple times. The current boom will likewise be at risk if an increase in inflation compels the Fed to raise interest rates beyond the modest rise the market currently expects.
Finally, watch for tech earnings to start falling short of analyst forecasts. The dot-com boom was driven in part by increasingly optimistic predictions for technology company earnings, and it imploded when earnings started to miss badly. Investors realized then that their expectations about profits from the internet revolution had become unreal.
Of course, no two booms will unfold exactly the same way. We are now eight years into this bull market, making it the second longest in history, behind only the run-up of the late 1990s. No bull market lasts forever, and while it is clear that we are entering the late stages of this cycle, it is impossible to say whether this moment is like 1999, or 1998 -- or earlier.
The clocks have no hands, and the black horsemen may appear at any time.

Full text: ONE hundred years ago, in a major advance for human dignity, the Supreme Court struck down a racial zoning law in Louisville, Ky., that prohibited nonwhites from moving into homes in majority-white areas. Laws like these, which existed in numerous cities at the time, are part of a larger, shameful history of government-sponsored racial segregation. In Buchanan v. Warley, the court ruled that such ordinances violate the 14th Amendment and related statutes that "entitle a colored man to acquire property without state legislation discriminating against him solely because of his color."
But this hardly ended racial discrimination in housing, as whites adopted biased policies like economic zoning that banned apartment buildings in areas designated for single-family homes, often adding minimum lot size requirements to boot. Because African-Americans were disproportionately low-income, economic zoning was in effect exclusionary, accomplishing much of the same results as explicit racial zoning.
"Such economic zoning was rare in the United States before World War I," Richard Rothstein of the Economic Policy Institute notes in his new book, "The Color of Law," "but the Buchanan decision provoked urgent interest in zoning as a way to circumvent the ruling," a ploy that would be used for decades. For example, as Mr. Rothstein notes, in 1953, shortly after about 250 African-Americans were transferred to work in a nearby Ford auto plant, the town of Milpitas, Calif., adopted a policy allowing the city council to ban apartments.
Developers challenged economic zoning in the courts, but with a different ultimate result. In the case of Village of Euclid v. Ambler Realty, a federal court struck down a zoning ordinance in a Cleveland suburb that prohibited apartment buildings in an area zoned for single- and two-family homes. The court noted that "the result to be accomplished is to classify the population and to segregate them according to their income or situation in life."
But when the case reached the Supreme Court in 1926, the justices declared that excluding apartment buildings was constitutional. In language laden with class bias, the court reasoned that an apartment house can be "a mere parasite, constructed in order to take advantage of open spaces and attractive surroundings created by the residential character of the district."
The Supreme Court's comparative willingness to tolerate explicit economic discrimination is mirrored in American public policy. In 1968, in another great advance for human equality, the Fair Housing Act outlawed discrimination in the sale and rental of housing units by such factors as race, national origin and religion. But the law, like the Buchanan decision almost 50 years earlier, did nothing to address economically exclusionary zoning.
The differing treatment of racial and economic discrimination in housing laws has had a predictable result. Racial segregation by residence, while still high, is falling as the Fair Housing Act has allowed middle-class black people to escape ghettos. The black-white dissimilarity index (in which zero is perfect integration and 100 is absolute segregation), has shrunk from a high of 79 in 1970 to 59 in 2010, according to an analysis of Census data. Between 2000 and 2010-2014, black-white segregation declined in 45 of 52 metropolitan areas.
But in recent decades, as Robert D. Putnam, a political scientist at Harvard, notes in his book "Our Kids," "while race-based segregation has been slowly declining, class-based segregation has been increasing." In fact, Professor Putnam says, "a kind of incipient class apartheid" has been sweeping across the country. In 2015, in a panel discussion with Mr. Putnam, President Barack Obama observed that "what used to be racial segregation now mirrors itself in class segregation."
Rising class segregation by residence is partly related to rising income inequality, but it is also the result of an expansion of exclusionary zoning. Research by Jonathan Rothwell, now at Gallup, and Douglas Massey, a sociologist at Princeton, has found that "a change in permitted zoning from the most restrictive to the least would close 50 percent of the observed gap between the most unequal metropolitan area and the least, in terms of neighborhood inequality."
Exclusionary zoning frustrates the Fair Housing Act's aim by erecting barriers that exclude millions of low-income African-Americans and Latinos from wealthier white communities. And growing numbers of poor whites are affected as well. As Paul Jargowsky, a professor of public policy at Rutgers University, notes, African-Americans and Hispanics remain much more likely to live in concentrated poverty than whites, but since 2000, there has been a 145 percent increase among non-Hispanic whites living in high-poverty neighborhoods.
Economic segregation matters because where you live affects so much in life -- your access to transportation, employment opportunities, decent health care, and, most important, good schools. In Montgomery County in Maryland, which requires developers to set aside units for low-income families, disadvantaged students attending good local schools cut the math achievement gap with their middle-class peers in half between 2001 and 2007, according to a study by Heather Schwartz, a RAND Corporation researcher.
To bolster the 1968 Fair Housing Act, we need a new "economic fair housing act" to prohibit or discourage local ordinances that unnecessarily exclude people from entire neighborhoods and their schools. Given political realities in Washington, we could begin with laws in friendly states and build toward a moment, sometime in the future, when the federal government would take on the issue.
In its strongest form such a law would ban unjustified and pervasive exclusionary zoning laws that prohibit townhouses or apartments in single-family areas or impose minimum lot sizes. These ordinances, Lee Anne Fennell of the University of Chicago Law School notes, have become "a central organizing feature in American metropolitan life."
If we can't achieve a ban, we should assess a penalty on municipalities that engage in discriminatory zoning, either by withholding infrastructure funds or limiting the tax deduction that homeowners in those towns can take for mortgage interest. At the same time, inclusionary zoning laws of the type used in Montgomery County are needed to promote mixed-income housing.
There would, of course, be fierce political and legal opposition from many property owners in exclusive neighborhoods who have enjoyed an unwarranted inflation of their home values through social engineering of a particularly pernicious stripe. Economists across the political spectrum agree that current exclusionary policies create an artificial scarcity of housing, driving up prices beyond what the market would naturally dictate.
Research finds that racial diversity lowers residential property values. Therefore, exclusionary zoning also unfairly increases the property values in white neighborhoods by reducing the number of minority residents.
The flip side of the equation is that modest drops in property values to genuine market levels will be a boon to young and minority purchasers, as the elimination of unfair government restrictions makes housing more affordable.
Wealthy property owners usually win in American politics, but not always, as an important 2010 vote in Massachusetts suggests. Back in 1969, the state passed an "anti-snob" zoning law that empowered state officials to alter local zoning laws in communities where less than 10 percent of housing stock was deemed affordable. In 2010, an effort to overturn the law through a statewide referendum was opposed by 58 percent of voters.
And, in this populist moment, it is possible that interesting alliances could coalesce around an economic fair housing act. On the left, civil rights groups, affordable housing advocates and antisprawl environmentalists could ally with groups on the right, including libertarians who oppose government regulation on principle and developers who chafe at restrictions on building density. Primary beneficiaries would include Republican working-class white constituencies and Democratic working-class communities of color. The statute would be in the classic tradition of anti-discrimination laws, yet would radically reorder an exclusionary system that has been widely accepted as given.
Just as it is shameful for government regulation to exclude people from neighborhoods on the basis of race, it is similarly deplorable for local governments to exclude entire groups of adults and children from communities on the basis of income. We can either make this problem better and integrate more fully or we can let it worsen and allow our society to disintegrate further.

Full text: LONDON -- At the vast Sainsbury's grocery store in south London's Tooting Broadway neighborhood, a basket of milk, eggs, bread, cornflakes and butter will cost shoppers four pounds and 70 pence, or about $6.15. A short walk away at Aldi and Lidl -- two German discount grocery stores -- those same items amount to £3.92. Those small differences in price are having a major impact on grocery shopping in Britain.
The vote last year to leave the European Union, known as Brexit, damaged confidence in the economy, and the pound has since fallen more than 10 percent against the dollar. That, in turn, has made imports more expensive, driving up the prices of staples like bananas and sugar. The Bank of England said on Thursday it expected inflation to accelerate. Wages, too, have started to drop, pushing many people to increasingly look for savings.
Opting for cheaper grocery stores like Aldi and Lidl is one such option, and the two retailers are taking advantage.
Britain's supermarket sector is ruthlessly competitive. Major retailers like Morrisons, Sainsbury's, Tesco and Walmart's Asda all jostle for market share by offering loyalty schemes, online shopping, home delivery and special offers (Amazon, by comparison, is a relative minnow in the grocery sector).
Long dismissed in Britain as shops targeting only lower-income discount-hunters, Aldi and Lidl have steadily made progress and, since Brexit, their growth in market share has accelerated.
Spending at the two stores grew by double digits in the 12 weeks to mid-July, according to Kantar Worldpanel, a research group, outpacing not only the wider industry but every other major supermarket. Together, they now account for more than 12 percent of the country's spending on groceries, up from just 4 percent a decade ago.
"When I was growing up, there used to be a bit of a stigma around shopping at discount stores at my school," said Christina Carr, who works at a bank in Newcastle, in northern England. If you shopped at one, "you'd be classed as a poor family, and the kids would be horrible."
When Ms. Carr, a 28-year-old bank employee, moved out of her grandparents' home, she found herself thinking much harder about her finances. She and her partner spent £60 on groceries every week, which looked increasingly unaffordable.
In November, she relented, switching from Asda and Sainsbury's to Aldi and Lidl. "The difference in price," Ms. Carr said, "it's really significant."
Aldi and Lidl, both of which are privately held, made their first ventures into Britain in the 1990s, focusing on price. They targeted suburban areas and had spartan interiors. But they initially made few inroads in a market where supermarkets can carry class connotations. Upmarket grocery stores add as much as 10 percent to real estate values.
That started to change when the financial crisis hit. Britain's economy went into recession and unemployment rose above 8 percent. Pay slumped in the years after the crisis, and though it has recovered somewhat, average wages are still lower in real terms than they were before the crisis.
A post-Brexit world has added to the popularity of "the discounters," as the two retailers are collectively known. Inflation was 2.6 percent year-over-year in June, higher than the Bank of England's target, and the central bank says it could rise to 3 percent in the fall. Official figures show disposable income has fallen. Rising grocery prices, in particular, mean the average household could spend £133 pounds more this year on its annual grocery bill compared with the previous 12 months, according to Kantar Worldpanel.
"U.K. households are quite sensitive to pressure on disposable income," said Edouard Aubin, an analyst at Morgan Stanley. "That is why they are switching to cheaper alternatives."
Aldi and Lidl push their low-price messages relentlessly, both in advertising campaigns and in stores. The two retailers stock significantly fewer products -- typically only a tenth as many as competitors -- with a greater focus on items sold under their own lower-cost brands. Many goods are placed on shelves still in the crates or boxes in which they were delivered.
At the Lidl in Tooting, stacks of vegetable boxes run down the middle of the store, while bright orange signs overhead advertise price cuts. The store's glass exterior is emblazoned with heart-shaped Union Jack flags and the words "Fresh British." Visitors to the Aldi across the road have to keep on the move to avoid staff members hurriedly restocking shelves or rushing to open cashier stalls.
They currently have nearly 1,400 outlets between them, and their sales have risen faster than those of rivals. Three in every five British households have shopped at either Aldi or Lidl, and the demographics of their customers are now similar to that of the broader population, according to Mr. Aubin at Morgan Stanley.
"Although they're small in the U.K., they're massive businesses in their own right," said James Walton, chief economist at IGD, which carries out research on the food and grocery industries. "They have great scale when considered globally, and they're only buying a fairly limited range of products."
As their customer base has expanded, the stores have expanded their offerings, adding seasonal product lines that include luxury goods like lobster or magnums of prosecco. Lidl, for example, is selling inflatable pool toys, avocado oil and Iberico ham.
That has helped retain a broader range of customers, like Mark Whitfield, who frequents both Aldi and Lidl in Sittingbourne, about 45 miles from London. "You're buying unusual or luxury products, but not paying as much," said Mr. Whitfield, 52.
Their expansion extends beyond Britain.
The American supermarket sector is significantly more fragmented than Britain's, and the German retailers have set their sights on expanding there. Among lower-price grocery stores, Aldi already has 1,600 stores in the United States and is planning to expand to 2,500 within the next five years. Lidl is looking at opening 100 outlets as well, after opening its first American stores in June.
The looming behemoth in the industry, however, remains Amazon, which bought Whole Foods in June. Though the online giant's Amazon Fresh and Pantry services are available in Britain, the company's market share here amounts to less than 1 percent, according to Kantar Worldpanel.
"Whether you look at the U.S., U.K.," said Mikey Vu, a partner focused on retail on Bain & Company, a consultant firm, "there's a larger proportion of the population that's concerned with where they're spending their money."
"The economy makes things a lot tougher for a lot of people," he said of American consumers. "People are watching their pennies more. The hard discounter model is attractive to them, just like we saw in the U.K."
The shift toward "the discounters" is not just a short-term issue for Britain's supermarket sector. Younger shoppers are increasingly willing to try supermarket-brand items, which are no longer seen as lower-quality knockoffs, a trend that could be accentuated if the economy takes a turn for the worse again.
"You're paying for the name" at other supermarkets, said Lucy Deacon, a 27-year-old who was shopping at the Aldi in Tooting. Ms. Deacon, who works in a local betting shop, said she would focus her shopping even further on discount supermarkets if Britain saw another downturn.
As she picked through spices for a curry she planned to cook that evening, Ms. Deacon said, "You get more for your money here."

Wall Street, Climbing Sharply, Skips Washington's 'Soap Opera'

Full text: Despite the disorder in Washington -- with a revolving door at the White House and roadblocks on Capitol Hill -- Wall Street and corporate America are booming. The disconnect was evident Wednesday, as the Dow Jones industrial average passed the 22,000 mark, a new high. At the same time, blue chips like Apple, Caterpillar and U.S. Steel have all reported strong earnings in recent weeks that surpassed analysts' forecasts.
"None of the soap opera in Washington matters," said Frank Sullivan, chief executive of RPM International, a Cleveland-based maker of specialty coatings and sealants like Rust-Oleum. "Nobody in business cares about who talked to who in Russia."
What does matter, Mr. Sullivan said, is stronger global demand in heavy industries like mining and oil and gas, a weaker dollar that helps exporters, and a lighter regulatory touch by the new administration.
The initial stock market rally that followed Mr. Trump's victory in November -- the so-called Trump bump -- was fueled by optimism among investors that long-sought action on tax reform and infrastructure spending might finally be at hand.
Few analysts are so sanguine now, especially after Republicans could not agree last month on how to repeal the Affordable Care Act, after years of promising to do so. If anything, simplifying the tax code or investing in new roads and bridges seems farther out of reach than ever.
But a market surge based on political hopes has been replaced by one more firmly grounded in the financial realm.
Besides steady economic growth or less regulation, investors also have been encouraged by the loose reins of central banks like the Federal Reserve, which have helped keep interest rates not far above their historic lows. Inflation, too, remains tame, with price increases in recent months actually falling short of the Fed's targets.
At the same time, with yields on safe assets like government bonds so minuscule, there are few appealing alternatives to stocks for investors, according to Torsten Slok, chief international economist at Deutsche Bank.
"No matter how you look at valuations, they are high," he said. "But as money flows into pension funds every month and needs to be invested, why would I put it in bonds?
"Corporations in America and Europe are still inventing new products and finding ways of doing things more efficiently," Mr. Slok said. "This is separate from the political theater around the world."
Moreover, corporate earnings -- the fundamental driver of individual stock performance -- have been robust.
The strength has spanned sectors ranging from technology to restaurants, as seen in the rise of almost 5 percent in Apple's shares on Wednesday, or McDonald's jump to a record high last month. Both are Dow components.
"The first six months of the year have been the best period for earnings growth since 2011," said Phil Orlando, chief equity strategist at Federated Investors.
Still, many Wall Street investors who are bullish over the longer-term, including Mr. Orlando, concede that the risk of a stock market correction was rising.
"We've had this fabulous run since the election," he said. "But could we see an air pocket in the next few months? Absolutely. Our best guess is that the next 5 percent move is more likely to be down than up."
Investors have also voiced concerns that trading has been unusually placid -- volatility recently sank to a two-decade low, and Wall Street has not had a correction, usually defined as a drop of 10 percent or more, since early 2016. With the current recovery entering its ninth year this summer, a recession seems inevitable.
But for now, whichever way the stock market goes, most economic metrics like hiring, consumer sentiment and home prices continue to point in the right direction.
Those trends predated Mr. Trump's taking office, although he took to Twitter several times this week to claim credit for the stock market's run and soaring earnings. Still, Mr. Sullivan of RPM said that while he did not vote for Mr. Trump, he gave the president credit for setting a new political tone toward corporate America in Washington.
"I'm in the middle of it in Cleveland, and small businesses are looking forward instead of over their shoulder," said Mr. Sullivan, who is the older brother of Senator Dan Sullivan, an Alaska Republican.
"When Washington practices the Hippocratic oath toward business -- first, do no harm -- it's amazing what the American economy can do," he said. "Under the prior administration, you had a very, very aggressive regulatory environment in which businesses felt under attack."
Easing regulation is also something Mr. Trump can do with the stroke of a pen or with appointments to agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Federal Reserve, which require confirmation but not legislation.
Bank stocks, for example, have been among strongest performers on Wall Street since the election, and the trade might be paying off: Regulators could soon weaken the Dodd-Frank Act's Volcker Rule, which restricted the ability of banks to make financial bets with their own capital.
To be sure, the glow from Wall Street extends only so far. According to the Federal Reserve's most recent Survey of Consumer Finances, less than 15 percent of American households owned individual stocks and only half had any exposure to the broader market, including through mutual funds or retirement plans.
"Only people with assets like stocks and houses are benefiting, and that's why this recovery has been weak," Mr. Slok said.
The contradictory signals between the markets and the political world are hardly unique to the United States. "Most investors in Europe are rolling their eyes at the U.S., but what's ironic is that it's similar to the European situation," Mr. Slok said.
As in Washington, Mr. Slok said, there has been little consensus in Brussels or other capitals on how to address major issues, including Britain's impending exit from the European Union, the continent's restrictive labor laws and Greece's fiscal problems.
If the stock market's prospects are unclear, then the outlook in Washington six months into the Trump administration is downright gloomy.
The year began with Mr. Trump promising to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act; pass the most significant overhaul to the tax code since 1986; and get Congress to pass legislation to rebuild the nation's crumbling infrastructure. None of that has been accomplished, as Republicans have struggled to shift from being an opposition party to one that governs.
Beyond those disappointments, fiscal land mines lie ahead that could rattle the economy if Republicans and Democrats cannot cooperate.
By the end of September, Congress must reach a deal to lift the debt ceiling and fund the government for the coming fiscal year. Republicans remain divided over whether conditions such as spending cuts should be attached to raising the statutory borrowing limit. A standoff with Democrats over Mr. Trump's request to finance a border wall could lead to a partial government shutdown.
The lack of progress has only led to more sniping among Republicans. This week Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said, "I think what's hurting the legislative agenda is Congress's inability to get things passed."
Further inaction could prove costly. The debt-limit brinkmanship and government shutdown during the Obama administration rattled markets and slowed economic growth. A Standard & Poor's analysis after the 2013 shutdown found that the 16-day standoff sucked $24 billion out of the economy.
Mr. Trump has pointed to the growing economy and strong employment figures as evidence that his agenda is thriving. The data is indeed encouraging, but not very different from the figures he used as a candidate to paint a picture of economic despair.
Still, the stock market's gains were likely to hold up as long as earnings remained buoyant, said Laszlo Birinyi, a longtime stock market analyst.
"While people may have strong feelings in other areas, the stock market is predicated on dollars and cents," he said.

Mr. Maduro's Drive to Dictatorship

Full text: Following a contentious vote on Sunday that effectively set Venezuela on the path to outright dictatorship, the United States has imposed personal sanctions on President Nicolás Maduro, putting him in the rarefied company of sitting leaders like Syria's Bashar al-Assad, North Korea's Kim Jong-un and Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe, whose rapacious greed for power has brought their countries to ruin. There is no longer any question that this is where Mr. Maduro belongs. No nation should have to suffer such a leader. And Venezuela, with possibly the world's largest oil reserves, had the chance to be one of South America's leading democracies. But overdependence on oil has led to political and economic turbulence, which became disastrous when Mr. Maduro sought to emulate his left-wing predecessor, Hugo Chávez, with lavish public spending that falling oil prices and chronic mismanagement rendered unsustainable.
Today Venezuela is a basket case. The estimated inflation rate for 2017 is 720 percent; 80 percent of Venezuelans live in poverty, suffering from malnutrition, illness and outright hunger, while corrupt politicians and their military allies shamelessly enrich themselves. Mr. Maduro's response has been to assail spreading street protests with an iron fist and to erode the power of the National Assembly, in which his opponents have a majority.
More than 120 people have died in several months of protests. The deadliest day was Sunday, when Mr. Maduro brought to a vote his transparently power-grabbing plan to elect a tame Constituent Assembly to write a new Constitution that would tighten the government's hold on power, and in the meantime allow the president to dismiss any branch of government deemed disloyal. The opposition boycotted the vote, allowing Mr. Maduro to claim victory despite what appeared to be a small turnout. Early on Tuesday, two opposition leaders already under house arrest were seized by state security agents.
Countering Mr. Maduro's drive to dictatorship is a challenge for his domestic and foreign opponents. Boycotting Venezuelan oil or oil-related businesses would precipitate a humanitarian crisis; leaving Mr. Maduro to his ways could lead to the radicalization of his opponents and uncontrolled violence. Efforts in the Organization of American States to suspend Venezuela in June were thwarted by the country's ideological allies and some Caribbean nations that Caracas supplies with cheap oil. Any sanctions by the United States -- aside from the dubious moral authority of the Trump administration -- feed Mr. Maduro's claims of an "imperial" America seeking to crush Venezuela.
The individual sanctions on Mr. Maduro, under which all his American assets are frozen and Americans are barred from doing business with him, come on the heels of similar sanctions on other Venezuelan officials, with the threat of more to come. They are for now the best way to pressure him and his allies. But pressure from the United States is not enough: European and Latin American nations should join in the quarantine of Mr. Maduro and his cronies while offering them a chance to negotiate with the opposition on ensuring free elections, respecting democratic institutions, releasing political prisoners and allowing the supply of urgently needed international humanitarian assistance.

Full text: CANTON, Miss. -- Caught among an administration that is frequently hostile to labor, a long-term decline in membership and a steady shift in jobs to the lightly unionized South, the United Automobile Workers long ago settled on this Mississippi town as a key to rebuilding its ranks and energizing the entire labor movement. But for more than 3,500 employees who will be voting Thursday and Friday on whether to unionize the sprawling Nissan plant here, the concern is more immediate: How much they can expect of their employer in a world of diminishing prospects for blue-collar workers -- not just in pay and benefits, but also in status and respect.
Conversations with 20 workers reveal a workplace bitterly divided on these questions. In one camp are those who feel that Nissan has provided a standard of living that would have been unattainable had the company not opened its nearly mile-long plant in Canton more than 14 years ago.
"Most of us just have a high school education," said Kim Barber, a quality technician who has been with Nissan since the plant opened, in an overfilled parking lot before her shift last week. "I'm almost 50. I can't go anywhere else."
Ms. Barber said she made about $26 an hour, roughly twice what she made in her previous job driving a forklift at a storage company, adjusting for inflation.
In another camp are those workers who believe they should not be asked to grade the company on the curve that is Mississippi's low-wage economy. "Nissan knew what they were doing when they put their plant around here," said Annie Matthews, a union supporter who is also in quality control and a veteran of 14 years at the plant.
Many people had been working at McDonald's making $7 an hour, she said, "and now this is the best thing that ever happened to them."
Union supporters complain that the company has been stingy with benefits and bonuses, that workers on the production line are pressured to sacrifice safety to keep the line moving briskly, and that supervisors arbitrarily change policies about discipline and attendance.
And another issue looms awkwardly over the forthcoming vote: race. A large majority of the nearly 6,500 workers at the Nissan plant are African-American. One does not have to search hard for racial overtones.
Along with some of her co-workers, Ms. Matthews, who is black, claimed that white supervisors rewarded white workers who were their friends with cushier assignments. "You've got Billy Bob as your manager, you go duck hunting, possum hunting together," she said.
(The company rejected the accusation, saying that promotions and assignments were made on the basis of merit, and that the rationale for decisions was not always visible to other employees.)
The U.A.W., for its part, has taken pains to highlight the campaign's racial dimension. In its news release announcing the impending vote, it quoted a worker who accused Nissan of violating African-Americans' labor rights even while marketing cars to them.
The union has also forged close alliances with local black pastors and community leaders, whose mantra has been that the ability to form a union is a civil right.
Anti-union workers at the plant have accused the U.A.W. of buying such support with tens of thousands of dollars in contributions to local civil rights and religious groups. The union says it has contributed to such groups for decades.
Bishop Thomas Jenkins, a local pastor who once led a group of fellow clergymen to the plant to urge Nissan to commit to an evenhanded election process, said Mississippi seemed to have a "spirit of mediocrity," sending a message that workers "ought to be glad to have a job." Mr. Jenkins said neither he nor his church had received money from the U.A.W.
In some ways the sensitivity about race may have prevented the organizing campaign from becoming more divisive than it otherwise might have.
During the U.A.W.'s last major campaign in the South, a losing effort at a Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga, Tenn., in 2014, much of the state's political class conveyed relentless hostility. A conservative group put up billboards tying the U.A.W. to "liberal politicians" including President Barack Obama and suggesting that Chattanooga would go the way of bankrupt Detroit if the union gained a foothold.
In Mississippi, union officials say, the state's Republican establishment has been relatively subdued, perhaps calculating that more aggressive opposition would be ineffective, even self-defeating.
"If the governor of the state of Mississippi says it's not good for you, then it must be great for you," said Barbara Blackmon, the Democratic state senator who represents the area.
Officials at the union, which has been working in earnest to organize the Canton plant since 2012, say a unionized South is crucial to restoring leverage for workers across the country, since employers can rein in wages by locating there, or merely threatening to. "There has to be a floor at some point that workers will not go past," said Gary Casteel, the union's second-ranking official.
Nissan, for its part, portrays the U.A.W. as self-interested. A slide presentation run repetitively inside the plant states, "It costs a lot of money to run a union!" and concludes, "That's why the U.A.W. is here -- it wants a piece of your paycheck." (Mr. Casteel said the union had grown consistently in recent years and was in strong financial shape.)
A Facebook page created by workers opposed to the union has drawn attention to the indictment of a former Fiat Chrysler official accused of diverting millions from a training center to himself and a U.A.W. counterpart. The U.A.W. said it had no knowledge of the scheme and was cooperating with the investigation.
Nissan says that its wages are significantly higher than the average in central Mississippi, and that while it ended eligibility for its pension plan after 2005, it makes two forms of contributions to employees' retirement accounts -- one matching a portion of what workers contribute, and one independent of their contributions. (The major American automakers contribute a roughly equivalent percentage of workers' income to their retirement funds.) Nissan distributes annual "thank you" bonuses to workers, worth $4,000 in each of the last two years, though the bonuses are not based on profitability, as is the practice with American automakers.
In an ad campaign, Nissan testifies to its efforts to improve the lives of its workers. One ad features an African-American supervisor who describes struggling to pay her bills as a single mother before landing at Nissan, which later promoted her and even helped her finish college.
"If anything, it should be the opposite argument," said Scott Waller, interim president and chief executive of the Mississippi Economic Council, a business advocacy group, alluding to the potential for racial polarization. The high proportion of African-Americans that Nissan employs at the plant, he said, "speaks to the great progress, the positive things that are happening in this state."
Still, workers say there is more than one way to divide them than along racial lines -- namely, by inciting fear. And Nissan -- which unlike Volkswagen before it has refused to stay neutral in the union campaign -- has not forsworn this tactic.
In a video shown to workers, Steve Marsh, the plant's top official, warned that the employees of General Motors, Ford and Fiat Chrysler represented by the U.A.W. "experienced significant instability in recent years, and suffered from many layoffs and plant closings."
Managers have also held frequent discussions with workers in which they make similar suggestions about how a union could hurt job security. Nissan says the meetings are intended to counter misinformation.
On Friday, a regional director of the National Labor Relations Board issued a complaint against Nissan, charging, among other things, that the company had illegally warned workers that the plant could close if they chose to unionize.
Workers say there are also fault lines between those who have more to lose and those who have less. For example, workers hired in the plant's early years make about $26 an hour and receive six days of paid time off each year; workers hired more recently top out at about $24 (and often make less) and receive only three paid days off.
Some workers are also promoted into less physically demanding jobs like quality control, while others languish on the assembly line for a decade or more.
Many of the anti-union workers are "in a job where they're just walking around with a clipboard, they're not on that line," said Eric Hearn, who has worked on one of the plant's assembly lines for five years. "They're willing to say anything."
At a meeting of workers at the local U.A.W. office last week, union supporters fumed about a recent slide presentation in which managers explained that Nissan could not guarantee most workers their old jobs in the event of a strike.
One worker, Chip Wells, later said in an interview that many colleagues were worried by the presentation, even though strikes are a rarity.
"It just scared a lot of people," Mr. Wells said.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Congressional Republicans moved on Tuesday to defuse President Trump's threat to cut off critical payments to health insurance companies, maneuvering around the president toward bipartisan legislation to shore up insurance markets under the Affordable Care Act. Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, the influential chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, announced that his panel would begin work in early September on legislation to "stabilize and strengthen the individual health insurance market" for 2018. He publicly urged Mr. Trump to continue making payments to health insurance companies to reimburse them for reducing the out-of-pocket medical expenses of low-income people.
In the House, two Republicans, Representatives Tom Reed of New York and Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania, teamed with Democrats to promote incremental health legislation that would also fund the cost-sharing subsidies.
The moves were a remarkable response to the president's repeated threats to send health insurance markets into a tailspin. They offered tangible indications of cooperation between the parties after Republican efforts to scrap the Affordable Care Act collapsed in the Senate last week, all but ending the seven-year Republican quest to overturn President Barack Obama's signature domestic achievement. Lawmakers from both parties concede that the health law needs improvement, as consumers face sharp premium increases and a shrinking number of insurance options in many states.
These problems have been exacerbated by a president who has publicly predicted that the Affordable Care Act will "implode" and appears determined to help fulfill that prophecy. Mr. Trump has repeatedly threatened to cut off the subsidies, known as cost-sharing reduction payments, which reimburse insurers for cutting deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs for millions of low-income people. Without them, insurers would almost certainly raise premiums not only for poor consumers but also for many other people buying plans on the individual insurance market.
In California, the state agency that runs the insurance marketplace announced on Tuesday that rates would increase by 12.5 percent on average next year. That is slightly lower than the rate increases Californians saw this year. But Peter V. Lee, the executive director of the agency, Covered California, said the average increase would be twice as high for popular "silver" plans if the Trump administration blocked the cost-sharing payments.
"This policy allowed health plans to stay in the market when they might have left otherwise," Mr. Lee said of the potential additional increase, which he called a "surcharge."
He added, "By the end of this month, we have to hear there's clarity that the cost-sharing reductions will be made, or we will apply the surcharge."
In Kentucky, according to data posted by the federal government, Anthem has requested rate increases averaging 34 percent for plans covering 69,500 people. BlueCross BlueShield of South Carolina has sought rate increases averaging 33 percent.
And Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas is seeking rate increases that average about 23 percent, and it said 389,800 people may be affected. The company cited uncertainty about cost-sharing subsidies as a factor, along with medical inflation.
In the House, a group of members known as the Problem Solvers Caucus announced agreement this week on a bipartisan set of proposals to stabilize insurance markets and revise the Affordable Care Act to provide relief to consumers and small and midsize businesses. The proposals would provide money for cost-sharing reduction payments, repeal a tax on medical devices and exempt businesses with fewer than 500 employees from the law's requirement to offer health insurance to workers.
"My hope is that maybe the president will take this into consideration in regards to the upcoming decision" on cost-sharing subsidies, said Mr. Reed, a co-chairman of the caucus, whose members are split roughly evenly between the two parties.
"Many in our parties don't want us to do this," Mr. Reed said of the bipartisan initiative. "Many of us still retain our philosophical opposition and substantive opposition to the Affordable Care Act. But it's clear to us that what we have to do is come together, find that common ground and govern for the American people."
Under the proposal, funds for the cost-sharing payments would be guaranteed, and Congress could review use of the money each year, just as it reviews other federal spending.
Mr. Alexander said that it was important for Mr. Trump to approve the payments for August and September, and that Congress should approve "in a bipartisan way" a continuation of the payments for at least a year.
"Without payment of these cost-sharing reductions," he said, "Americans will be hurt. Up to half of the states will likely have bare counties with zero insurance providers offering insurance on the exchanges, and insurance premiums will increase by roughly 20 percent, according to America's Health Insurance Plans," a trade group for insurers.
Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the senior Democrat on the health committee, welcomed Mr. Alexander's statement.
Mr. Alexander said the committee would hold hearings starting the week of Sept. 4 "on the actions Congress should take to stabilize and strengthen the individual health insurance market, so that Americans will be able to buy insurance at affordable prices in the year 2018."
He said the committee expected to hear from state insurance commissioners, patients, governors, health care experts and insurance companies.
Mr. Alexander said his proposal was a necessary response to an imminent crisis.
"In my opinion," Mr. Alexander said, "any solution that Congress passes for a 2018 stabilization package would need to be small, bipartisan and balanced. It should include funding for the cost-sharing reductions, but it also should include greater flexibility for states in approving health insurance policies."
Payment of the cost-sharing subsidies is a top priority for insurers and for Democrats in Congress, who say that cutting off the payments would cause havoc in insurance markets.
The president has the power to stop the payments because a federal judge ruled last year that the Obama administration had been illegally making the payments, in the absence of a law explicitly providing money for the purpose.
The Obama administration appealed the ruling, and the case is pending before the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
House Republicans, who filed suit to stop the payments in 2014, and the Trump administration have told the court that they are discussing "measures that would obviate the need for judicial determination of this appeal, including potential legislative action."
The appeals court on Tuesday allowed California, New York and 15 other states to intervene in the case. The states have shown a substantial risk that termination of the cost-sharing payments "would lead directly and imminently to an increase in insurance prices, which in turn will increase the number of uninsured individuals for whom the states will have to provide health care," the court said.
Mr. Alexander said he hoped Congress would eventually approve long-term measures to create a more robust market for people who buy insurance on their own. But first, he said, "we need to put out the fire in these collapsing markets."
The cost-sharing payments help people with incomes of 100 percent to 250 percent of the federal poverty level (about $12,060 to $30,150 a year for an individual). But some Republicans say that providing the money would amount to "a bailout for insurance companies," in the words of Senator Ted Cruz of Texas.
"It's what the Democrats want," Mr. Cruz said on Tuesday. "The Democrats are the party of the big insurance companies."

Full text: LONDON -- Up an alley, beyond some hoarding, through what can feel like Harry Potter's secret portal, the underworld of an unfinished Crossrail station sprawls beneath the traffic and commotion of Tottenham Court Road. Escalator banks descend through a sleek, silent black ticket hall where towering, empty, white-tiled passageways snake toward the new, vaulted train platform, curving like a half moon into the subterranean darkness. Crossrail is not your average subway. London's $20 billion high-speed train line, which plans to start taking passengers late next year, is Europe's biggest infrastructure project.
It will be so fast that crucial travel times across the city should be cut by more than half. The length of two soccer pitches, with a capacity for 1,500 people, its trains will be able to carry twice the number of passengers as an ordinary London subway. While Londoners love to moan about their public transit network, by comparison New York has barely managed to construct four subway stops in about a half-century and its aged, rapidly collapsing subway system now threatens to bring the city to a halt.
But standing one recent morning on that empty Crossrail platform, where construction workers in orange gear and hard hats hauled shiny metal panels to line the walls, I still couldn't help wondering whether the new train leads toward another glorious era for this city, or signals the end of one.
Before Britain voted last summer to leave the European Union, Crossrail was conceived for a London open to the world and speeding into the future. Now, with Brexit, the nightmare scenario is that this massive project, to provide more trains moving more people more quickly through a growing city, ends up moving fewer people more quickly through a shrinking city.
Crossrail was built by a Britain whose strength grew, for better and worse, out of a longstanding, stodgy but reliable confidence that the country knew itself and where it hoped to go in the century ahead. It is no longer even certain that Prime Minister Theresa May will survive the year.
It was an especially unpromising sign this spring when Mrs. May's Conservative government, as if fearing exactly what anti-Brexiters predicted about an economic downturn, issued a campaign manifesto that conspicuously omitted funding for Crossrail 2, the long-planned, $39 billion critical north-south sequel to Crossrail's east-west line.
Since then, the government's transport secretary has endorsed the project -- provided that the city pay half the whopping cost, upfront. The semi-reversal suggested a grudging acknowledgment that, whatever the political fallout or economic prospects, Britain ultimately needs a thriving London all the more after Brexit.
During the past three decades, London has been transfigured by wild growth, much of it the consequence of government-sustained megaprojects: Along with Crossrail, there have been the stupendous renovations to King's Cross and St. Pancras Stations, the wholesale invention of Canary Wharf, the addition of the Jubilee subway line, the Olympic makeover at Stratford in East London and the expansion of Heathrow Airport.
These megaprojects, in different ways, helped remake London into the great global city-state of Europe, a 21st-century melting pot and Sybaris of culture and free-market prosperity -- at the same time that they clearly exacerbated underlying urban inefficiencies and stirred resentment elsewhere in England toward the city.
Crossrail was intended as a kind of democratizing corrective, at once shrinking the city and expanding on a vision of London as a great, inclusive metropolis. While it will whisk bankers at new speeds from their office towers and multimillion-dollar aeries to Heathrow, it will also help millions of now-marginalized, lower-income workers, unable to afford runaway home prices in and around the center of the city, to live in cheaper neighborhoods often far from their jobs.
But what if the flow of incoming bankers slows, if immigrants look elsewhere, if the excesses of European money and human capital that helped drive growth begin to dry up? As Brexit skeptics warned, the pound has lost value and inflation is starting to rise. Some companies are already making plans to move employees out of London.
And as London goes, so goes Britain.
A New Spine for an Old City
I spent a few days traveling the Crossrail route, trying to decipher what it might mean for London. In one respect, the train underscores and extends the city's centuries-old, traditional identity as a sprawling, horizontal capital, an agglomeration of disparate, far-flung villages.
Extending roughly 70 miles, it is built to speed about 200 million passengers a year in a kind of Y from far to the west of the city, in the county of Berkshire, through Heathrow, to the heart of London, forking east to Shenfield in Essex and to the neighborhood called Abbey Wood, on the historically neglected southeast side of the Thames River. Linked with the existing Underground subway network, it will be rechristened the Elizabeth Line, inserting what is in effect a new steel-and-wheels spine into Britain's capital.
"Crossrail is a culmination of years of serious thinking by experts and public officials about what London needs, the imbalance of east and west and how to unite the city," said Ricky Burdett, an architect, city adviser and director of LSE Cities at the London School of Economics.
London, Mr. Burdett noted, is historically poor in the east, rich in the west and along the periphery, although that east-west distinction has eroded as gentrification has seeped outward. Underserved and long-disconnected East London neighborhoods like Shoreditch and Whitechapel in recent years have become chic and largely unaffordable to many Londoners. The city has added light-rail lines to help some of those areas, but only Crossrail is capable of "tying together many of the developments that have transformed London," Mr. Burdett said.
No development on the west end of the Crossrail line is more ambitious than Heathrow. John Holland-Kaye, the airport's chief executive officer, met me one morning in an empty conference room near the airport and instantly ticked off some figures.
Heathrow is not only Britain's busiest airport. It is hoped that the airport's expansion, based on the prospect of a new runway, might generate up to 180,000 new jobs across Britain, roughly 40,000 of them in London. Crossrail now promises to bring six million people and 80 percent of London's corporations within an hour's commute of the airport, up from three million and 50 percent today.
"When Crossrail is done, our employees could just as easily come from East London as from our local community," Mr. Holland-Kaye said. "The train effectively opens up the whole of the city."
Transit as Economic Engine
But Brexit threatens Heathrow's economy with more restrictive customs and immigration rules. Mr. Holland-Kaye acknowledged the threat but framed Crossrail as a kind of hedge against Brexit. He cited as a precedent the area around King's Cross, once notorious for drugs and prostitution, metamorphosed after the renovation of the decrepit King's Cross station and its neighbor St. Pancras, now serving the Eurostar express train to Paris and other cities in Europe.
King's Cross today is home to an art school, The Guardian, a cluster of high-tech medical research centers and Google's future European headquarters. The point: Major, long-term infrastructure projects support game-changing investments. Crossrail proves Britain's continuing commitment to this steel and concrete approach, Mr. Holland-Kaye said.
From Heathrow, riders will need just over a half-hour via Crossrail to travel east to Canary Wharf, the defunct docklands turned world financial hub, which today employs more than 112,000 people. When the site opened in the late 1980s, the aptly named Narrow Street was its only real access road. Canary Wharf went belly up. Then London broke ground for the Jubilee subway line, linking Canary Wharf by mass transit to the heart of the city, and international banks started moving in.
This is one reason George Iacobescu, Canary Wharf's longtime chairman, helped lead the push for Crossrail. "London's future prosperity depends on it," he said. He summoned me into a big, bright white office where he stood behind a giant tabletop display of London (think Goldfinger's model of Fort Knox). Mr. Iacobescu flicked switches on the table. One by one, they lit up various rail lines that today serve Canary Wharf, each line coinciding with increases in jobs and revenues. Theatrically, he paused before the last switch.
It illuminated Crossrail.
"We are home to many of the world's great financial institutions," Mr. Iacobescu said, pointing on the model to where Foster & Partners, the celebrated London-based architecture firm, has designed Canary Wharf's Crossrail Station, a spectacular glass and timber tubular structure, docked like a giant cruise ship beside the firm's HSBC tower. Nearby, Canary Wharf plans to build thousands of new luxury (and some affordable) homes and other developments by high-end architects like Herzog & de Meuron to turn Canary Wharf into more of a neighborhood. "We expect to create thousands more jobs," Mr. Iacobescu said.
"The danger with Brexit," he added, "is that if Britain gets out of the European Union and doesn't keep the U.K. an attractive place for financial institutions, they will think twice about growing here. The issue isn't banks leaving Canary Wharf. Most of them have long-term leases. The issue will be the pace of growth."
But that's not quite true. Because of Brexit worries, construction plans for several of Canary Wharf's new buildings have already been put on hold. And long-term leases can always be broken.
"The bottom line is that nobody has the faintest idea yet what the Brexit effect will be," Tony Travers, a veteran urban policy expert, told me. "Investments from the European Union may shrink. But why would investors from India or Canada or the United States be put off? If anything, Brexit may make Britain more likely to give them what they want."
Lately, the Leadenhall Building, otherwise known as the Cheesegrater, the tallest tower in the old, central financial district called the City of London, designed by Rogers Stirk Harbour & Partners, sold to a Chinese property tycoon for $1.5 billion, the second-highest-ever sale of a building in Britain. Qataris were behind the Shard, the Renzo Piano-designed tower that is London's sleekest skyscraper. Malaysians are developing the former Battersea Power Station, where Apple is an anchor tenant.
"The trajectory of real estate investment here is not only based on Europeans," Mr. Burdett stressed.
So, Crossrail or Brexit?
Connectivity is destiny in the farthest reaches of East London. Thamesmead, a social housing development from the 1960s, lies a half-hour or so by bus beyond the train's final stop and its ripple effects. Equivalent in area to all of central London, it is home to just 50,000 residents, once nearly all of them white and working-class, but today, increasingly, Nigerians. Peabody, a nonprofit housing organization, has announced plans to build hundreds more apartments in Thamesmead. Some lovely, neatly tended homes already exist alongside Brutalist blocks, rundown but now stylish (this is where "A Clockwork Orange" was filmed). That said, with the lowest average income in London, Thamesmead has few stores, little street life and an abundance of sewage treatment plants and prisons. It suffers from its isolation.
"Thamesmead was built on a promise of transit connectivity that never happened," Teresa Pearce, a member of Parliament who represents the district, told me. "You see the results."
By comparison, the final stop on that southeast spur of Crossrail is Abbey Wood, where Sainsbury's, the chain store and a bellwether of gentrification and commercial investment, has lately opened a shop in anticipation of the train. Streets here are lined with terrace houses now occupied by plasterers and truck drivers. Record numbers of landlords in the area have been filing applications for renovations, believing that Crossrail will attract bankers and lawyers. Property values are expected to rise on average 10 percent around all future stations along the Crossrail route.
Change is even more acute one stop before Abbey Wood, in Woolwich. The Berkeley Group, a big British real estate company, is building 5,000 sleek, mostly high-end apartments around the future Crossrail station, which the developer paid millions to help construct.
Hugging the Thames River, Woolwich is the former site of the Royal Arsenal and Henry VIII's dockyard, where Charles Darwin's Beagle was built. Historically working-class, it, too, used to be all white but has come to attract Caribbean and Asian immigrants, with nearly 40 percent of residents today living in social housing. Berkeley's development and the Woolwich Crossrail station are separated from the rest of Woolwich by a highway called Plumstead Road. On one side of the road, old Woolwich is a warren of modest shops and aged social housing.
On the other, baristas now dispense macchiatos on leafy patios. Signs advertise luxury apartments. A single, 31-year-old corporate lawyer employed in the City, Calum Docherty, who is hunting for a home, was intrigued by the Berkeley development. "But I'm still looking," he told me. "Woolwich wasn't anywhere on my radar before Crossrail. The train has expanded my concept of London.
"That said, it's a bit of a mental jump to commit to borrowing half a million pounds," he added. "With Brexit and all."

Full text: The economy's trajectory in President Trump's first year in office is looking a lot like it did during President Barack Obama's last year in office. The Commerce Department reported on Friday that the economy rebounded last quarter after a slow start to 2017, bringing the growth rate for the first half of the year to just under 2 percent. In 2016, the economy expanded at an annual rate of 1.5 percent.
The latest figures are a long way from the 4 percent pace Mr. Trump has promised, and they underscore how remarkably consistent, if hardly spectacular, the economy's performance has been since the current recovery started eight years ago this summer.
"This is more of the same," said Patrick Newport, an economist at IHS Markit. "We are doing better than just about any other developed Western economy, even though this doesn't meet the standards we're used to. We're the leader of a slow-moving pack."
The 2.6 percent expansion rate last quarter should assuage fears stirred by the economy's near stall in January, February and March, when gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of just 1.2 percent.
It also suggests that policy makers at the Federal Reserve will stick with their plan to gradually raise interest rates while shrinking the central bank's balance sheet.
But the expansion camouflages some more profound shifts just under the economy's surface.
Sectors like technology, health care and banking are thriving, even as industries like retail shed jobs.
And while the 4.4 percent unemployment rate is the lowest in a decade, wage growth remains frustratingly slow, and the fortunes of college-educated workers have diverged sharply from those with a high school diploma or less.
The stock market has also been soaring and the housing market is similarly robust in many parts of the country, especially in coastal areas like New York, Washington, San Francisco and Boston.
In the latest quarter, the economy benefited from steady consumer spending and an improving trade balance, while less robust state and local spending, along with slower inventory growth, worked as headwinds. Demand from shoppers for durable goods like automobiles, appliances and furniture contributed more than a full percentage point to growth.
Another bright spot lately has been the dollar's decline against other currencies, especially the euro, which makes American exports more competitive overseas.
This week, the government also reported positive figures on orders for durable goods in June and a slightly more favorable trade balance.
The dollar's softness benefits American companies with sales abroad, as those foreign revenues are translated into dollars.
Diane Swonk, an independent economist in Chicago, cited impressive earnings reports from McDonald's and Caterpillar recently, and said currency gains should serve as a tailwind for corporate profits later this year. The dollar has declined as other economies, especially those in Europe, have been showing signs of life, even as expectations for the American economy have cooled this year.
Just a few months ago, economists were expecting a strong rebound for the second quarter, with the consensus in May calling for 3.7 percent growth. There was talk of a "Trump Bump" as consumer and business sentiment improved.
Those hopes came down to earth, however, amid moderate spending by consumers, which accounts for roughly two-thirds of all economic activity.
And with deep divisions on Capitol Hill between Republicans and Democrats, as well as within the Republican majority itself -- underscored early Friday by the Senate rejection of a health care bill -- hopes have faded for the kind of big infrastructure program or comprehensive tax reform Mr. Trump has promised.
"At most we are expecting a slight cut in corporate tax rates next year, not big cuts," Ms. Swonk said. "It won't be the kind of sweeping reform we need."
"The infighting both within the White House and both political parties exceeds the partisan gridlock we've become accustomed to," she added. "Infrastructure spending seems to have fallen off the radar screen."
In the second half of the year, economists like Michael Gapen of Barclays are predicting growth will remain in a range of 2 percent to 2.5 percent. "The economy remains in a modest growth path, and last quarter was driven by gains in household and business spending," Mr. Gapen said.
"The surprise came in the area of trade, where it looks like solid growth outside the U.S. and a weaker dollar boosted exports," Mr. Gapen added. "This is a turnaround from last year, when a stronger dollar was a drag on growth."
The figure released on Friday is the first of three estimates that the Commerce Department will provide on growth in April, May and June. The final number could be revised higher or lower, depending on factors like consumer spending, business investment, factory orders and imports and exports.
The White House has said that its long-term target for growth is 4 percent, and Mr. Trump has repeatedly said that the economy could grow faster if regulations were rolled back and trade policies were toughened to encourage American companies to manufacture more of their products in the United States.
But many economists say that goal is unrealistic, given fundamental factors like an aging population and the retirement of the baby boomers, along with years of slow productivity gains.
The last time annual economic growth topped 4 percent was in 2000, at the end of the tech-fueled boom of the late-1990s. Since then, the American economy's best annual performance was in 2005, just before the bursting of the housing bubble, when annual growth was 3.3 percent.
"We could grow slightly faster than we are now, if you had comprehensive tax reform and a 10-year infrastructure spending program," Mr. Gapen said. "That could get us to 2.5 percent growth per year or slightly better. But 4 percent is highly unlikely."

Full text: To ride down the Columbia River as the John Day Dam's wall of concrete slowly fills the view from a tugboat is to see what the country's largest network of energy-producing dams created through five decades of 20th-century ambition, investment and hubris. Nearly half of the nation's hydropower electricity comes from more than 250 hydropower dams that were built on the Columbia and its tributaries -- a vast and complex arc of industry and technology that touches tens of millions of lives across the West every day.
Google taps the river's energy to power a data center 90 minutes east of Portland, Ore. -- drawn there by some of the cheapest, most environmentally friendly electricity in the nation. Farmers farther upriver in Washington State pump irrigation water into alfalfa fields -- with both the water and the electricity supplied by a dam. The Space Needle in Seattle uses Columbia River electricity to slowly spin tourists in its sky-view restaurant. High-voltage transmission lines shoot south to California.
Now, the Trump administration has proposed rethinking the entire system, with a plan to sell the transmission network of wires and substations owned by the Bonneville Power Administration, a federal agency that distributes most of the Columbia basin's output, to private buyers.
The idea is part of a package of proposals that would transform much of the infrastructure in the United States to a mixture of public and private partnerships, lowering costs to taxpayers and improving efficiency, administration officials said. Assets of two other big public power operators, based in Colorado and Oklahoma, would be sold, too, if Congress approves the measure.
Debates about government and its role in land and environmental policy are always highly charged. But perhaps nowhere could the proposed changes have a more significant impact than along the great river of the West -- fourth largest by volume in North America, more than 10 times that of the Hudson. Privatization would transform a government service that requires equal standards across a vast territory -- from large cities to tiny hamlets -- into a private operation seeking maximum returns to investors.
Wringing profits from a system that has provided electricity at cost would inevitably raise prices, critics of the idea said, while supporters envision a streamlined grid open to innovations that government managers cannot imagine.
A New York Times reporter and photographer went down the river in June, bunking with a five-man tug crew over 30 hours as workers cooked their meals, rested between shifts and transited through four dams and locks. We were looking for the interconnections of electricity and navigation, private industry and government management, engineering and biology, and what is at stake in this new energy debate.
Those stakes start with the scale. Grand Coulee alone, the biggest dam on the river, ships power to 10 states and creates enough electricity to power all the households in Missouri for a year. The 12 million cubic yards of concrete it contains is enough to build a highway from Seattle to Miami.
The possible fate of that system is raising alarms for some, and questions for almost everyone whose life connects to the river.
"The uncertainty is the biggest thing of all: How would it work?" Terry Oxley, the captain of the tugboat, the Crown Point, said as he gazed out over the water, hands flicking the controls with practiced aplomb. Mr. Oxley, 63, has worked the tugs for 39 years.
"I guess I want more input," he added. "Who's going to control it? Who's going to have the say-so? When are they going to release the water, the flood control, the spill patterns for the fish? It's such a big deal, and it's all intertwined."
Approaching the Locks at McNary Dam
UMATILLA, Ore. -- It was just before 2 a.m., and the fierce winds that were gusting to 50 miles per hour earlier in Riley Wyatt's shift on the Crown Point had eased. But Mr. Wyatt was taking no chances.
"No room for error," he said as he slowed the tug to a crawl approaching the locks at McNary Dam, 200 miles upriver from Portland. The Crown Point had picked up a 14,000-ton load in Pasco, Wash. -- three barges of wheat and one empty fuel tanker -- before taking it to Vancouver, Wash. Crew members were posted on the four barges pushed by the tug, reporting back by radio as the distance to the walls of the lock narrowed to inches.
"We're pushing a lot of energy," Mr. Wyatt, 41, said. "We hit something even at one mile an hour, it makes a big boom."
The dams and the locks that make up Mr. Wyatt's workplace were built by engineers who utterly transformed -- or destroyed, depending on your point of view -- what had been one of the wildest rivers in America.
From the mid-1930s, when construction began on the Grand Coulee and Bonneville Dams, through the mid-1970s, when the last major dams were completed on two Columbia tributaries, builders set the standard for public works as tools of economic development. Coulee and Bonneville employed about 9,000 construction workers, and Coulee alone cost about $5.5 billion in today's inflation-adjusted dollars.
The dams blocked the river's flow, creating a network of placid reservoirs. Irrigation canals spidered out, fostering one of the nation's richest breadbaskets in the orchards and vineyards of Washington. Mammoth turbines powered the airplane factories of Puget Sound and the boom of postwar California.
But development came with costs. Native American tribes saw their lands destroyed. Salmon stocks, already decimated by overfishing, were driven into further peril by rising water temperatures and dams that made it harder for fish to move up- and downriver in their ancient cycles of reproduction.
Native American tribal leaders said that the old river would never come back, but that the federal government was now bound, through court decisions and treaties, to work with tribes going forward.
"Obligations are tied to the federal relationship," said Jaime A. Pinkham, the executive director of the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission and a member of the Nez Percé tribe. "When you privatize, what happens to the voice of the Indian people?"
At the Confluence of the Columbia and Snake Rivers
PASCO, Wash. -- While the idea of selling some or all of what the federal government built here is not new -- President Ronald Reagan floated the idea in the early 1980s -- it's a much different debate this time. Reagan proposed a clean-sweep sale of public power into private hands, from dams to wires.
The new proposal would keep the electricity-making in government control, while spinning off the system of getting that electricity to market. Partial privatization would require complex new contracts delineating the responsibilities of the public and private partners. And what feeds into that system has grown more complicated since the 1980s as well, with a huge growth of new sources like wind and solar.
But some energy experts who back the Trump plan said that despite the thorny details, a powerful word could resonate in Congress: fairness. Low prices in a nonprofit system have been a huge boost to economic growth in this corner of the nation.
"We should have a debate about why some minority of Americans get subsidized power and others don't," said Chris Edwards, an economist at the Cato Institute.
Government brought electricity to remote rural towns starting in the 1930s, and people there haven't forgotten.
John Friederichs, manager of the Ferry County Public Utility District in northeast Washington, said a shift in focus to larger population centers, because that's where the profits are, could leave tiny markets like his -- about 7,500 people -- out in the cold with lower priority for maintenance or repairs.
"When you have something that works, having caution about changing it seems reasonable," he said.
Technology Giants Find a Home
THE DALLES, Ore. -- Powerful new economic voices have emerged since the last big grid debate, as companies like Google, Microsoft and Amazon invested billions of dollars in building data centers for the internet in Bonneville's territory. Those new customers already inject greater private market forces into the system as they negotiate contracts for their energy needs.
In cities like The Dalles, 90 minutes east of Portland, Google has become a community patron of sorts, too, residents said, with grants to libraries and schools.
"Google has been good for us," said the city's mayor, Steve Lawrence. "They're a full partner."
But discontent with the old system of public power has grown in some places, bolstering the political chances of privatization. In Sherman County, Ore., for example, southeast of The Dalles, President Trump won 72 percent of the vote, and critics of Bonneville Power seem just about as prevalent because of how grid operators have incorporated, or not, the new rising force of wind energy into a system dominated by hydropower.
Wind revenue is paying for the expansion of the Sherman County Courthouse and the annual dividend checks that property owners in the county have received. Kathy McCullough said kilowatt dollars had become important to her family farm's budget, hedging against fluctuations in wheat prices.
Bonneville power managers repeatedly hit the off switch on wind this year in Sherman -- curtailment is the term -- because too much water was coming through the dams after last winter's huge snowpack, which in turn meant more hydroelectricity flowing through the grid.
More curtailments have happened this year than ever before, according to the Northwest Power and Conservation Council, as Bonneville managers struggled to keep the system in balance. A change in ownership, supporters of the Trump plan in Sherman said, could be good for them in opening new opportunities for wind power sales.
"The B.P.A. does a terrible job," Ms. McCullough said in reference to Bonneville Power. "I don't know that privatizing would be bad at all."
Some environmental groups also chafe against Bonneville, for the access fees that they said could discourage wind development and the system's difficulties in juggling all of the new energy sources.
But Doug Howell, a spokesman for the Sierra Club in Washington State, said privatizing would not solve those problems -- and could in fact make them worse.
"The answer is not privatizing," he said. "It's integration."
One longtime veteran of river management said the new argument over the power system's future just reprised an old question: Whom does the Columbia belong to?
"Everybody takes a piece of the Columbia," said Tom Eckman, a senior adviser to the Northwest Power and Conservation Council. "And then they have to collaborate and cooperate over its resources, or fight over them."

Full text: TOPEKA, Kan. -- For more than six years, Gov. Sam Brownback has steered Kansas on a hard right turn on one issue after another: taxes, guns, abortion rights, Medicaid and welfare benefits. He will leave as an unpopular leader of a state in uncertain fiscal health, with more robust conservative policies and governed by a Legislature in which many in his own Republican Party have defied him. Polished, persistent and self-assured, Mr. Brownback has been seen as a model for the opportunities and perils of governing without compromise from the right on both social and fiscal issues.
But after the Trump administration said on Wednesday that Mr. Brownback, 60, would be nominated to serve as an ambassador at large for international religious freedom, his legacy in Kansas may be a cautionary note that even in a Republican state, there are dangers in governing too far to the right.
"He puts the lie to the myth that the default strategy is just to go as conservative as you possibly can in Kansas," said Chapman Rackaway, a longtime observer of Kansas politics, now at the University of West Georgia.
On Thursday, standing beneath a buffalo head mounted on the wall of his office, Mr. Brownback was by turns contemplative, jovial and emotional as he announced that his time as governor would be coming to an end. For about the first five minutes, he listed what he felt were his accomplishments, including a sustainable water plan for western Kansas farmers and the growth of the state's wind energy industry.
Still, the rollback of his signature 2012 tax cuts by the Legislature last month, a stinging rebuke, hung heavy.
"I'd like to have kept the income taxes lower," Mr. Brownback said. "And I'd like to have kept the business tax deduction."
Yet he remained defiant to the criticism that his tax policies had left the state with huge budget deficits. Asked if he should have approached his tax policies differently, he largely blamed a weak national economy for the state's fiscal woes.
"If there's one thing I could change, it'd be the price of oil and the price of wheat," he said. "We hit a recession in '15."
Mr. Brownback's nomination is something of an anticlimactic turn for a figure who once sought to cut a path from the Iowa caucuses to the White House, and then reinvented himself as a tax-slashing activist governor.
Viewed last year as a prospect for President Trump's cabinet, Mr. Brownback will settle instead into a low-profile diplomatic post with no particular political clout.
Still, in his remarks, he spoke fervidly of his new role. At one point, explaining how taking communion could get people killed in some countries, Mr. Brownback, who is Catholic, became red in the face, paused and had to take a sip from a Styrofoam cup before continuing to speak.
In some respects, the position may be a return to an earlier version of Mr. Brownback's political persona: During his time in the United States Senate, he was known chiefly as an articulate and well-mannered advocate for conservative social issues, like opposing abortion and human cloning, and for speaking out on issues of international human rights.
Bob Vander Plaats, an evangelical activist in Iowa, said that when Mr. Brownback ran for president in 2008, he was not viewed as the tax-cutting crusader he turned out to be as governor.
"Not that lowering taxes wasn't important to us, but he was always seen as a pro-family candidate," said Mr. Vander Plaats, who backed Mike Huckabee that year.
To critics and allies alike, Mr. Brownback's fatal flaw might have been his unyielding devotion to his conservative tax doctrine.
He argued that Kansas should be more like Texas and Florida, states without income tax -- though he barely addressed the concerns of people who said that those states had other major revenue generators in oil and tourism.
Dan Hawkins, a Republican state representative, has been a close ally of Mr. Brownback's over the years. He said the governor "has had an extremely successful administration," pointing to things like welfare overhaul and privatizing the state's Medicaid system.
But Mr. Brownback's tax policy was his downfall, Mr. Hawkins said.
"Maybe the governor was out there a little bit on his own, away from mainstream Kansas on his tax policy," Mr. Hawkins said. "That's maybe why you have the backlash. To demonize him over it is wrong, too. What he wanted was laudable. He wanted growth for Kansas."
The governor's stubbornness in sticking with conservative orthodoxy on taxes was in some ways counter to his more pragmatic approach in other areas.
He recently toured the state's western reaches to promote conservation measures for the Ogallala Aquifer, the nation's largest freshwater aquifer, whose depletion could be detrimental to Kansas' vital agricultural economy.
And he has been generally supportive of providing financial incentives to renewable energy providers as a way of boosting Kansas' wind energy industry.
His expected successor, Lt. Gov. Jeff Colyer, a plastic surgeon from suburban Kansas City, has been a close supporter of Mr. Brownback's policies and is viewed as unlikely to reverse course.
And allies, like State Senator Ty Masterson, a Republican, praised the governor's accomplishments, saying Kansas had gone from "an abortion state to a strong anti-abortion state, and from a high-income-tax to a low-income-tax state."
"It is true our state government had some hard spending choices to make with the slower tax revenue growth, but our people had more money in their pockets, until this year, when the new Legislature overrode his veto and gave that hard choice back to our constituents," Mr. Masterson said.
To Steve Brunk, a former Republican state representative, Mr. Brownback's reputation was hurt by what he felt were distortions about the impact of his tax policy and state spending.
He said that lawmakers under Mr. Brownback increased funding for schools -- though education advocates argued that those increases did not keep up with inflation, and the costs of supporting growing school populations.
Mr. Brunk also pointed to legislation passed in 2015 that increased consumption taxes -- on things like cigarettes and the sales tax -- and closed tax loopholes as ways that the governor was working to help right the state's finances.
"In my mind it was just a matter of waiting for the economy to recover," he said. "We believe now that it is recovering. And so the tax cuts that are in place would do a lot to stimulate the economy."
Others, including many Republicans, saw less to praise. State Representative Stephanie Clayton, a moderate Republican, said she was "excited" about Mr. Brownback's likely departure and called it "an opportunity for Kansas to have a fresh start, for us to return to dignity in governing."
Ms. Clayton said the governor's tenure had been marked by division within the Republican caucus and political hostility toward moderates like her.
But Ms. Clayton said she did not doubt that Mr. Brownback was genuine in his conservative beliefs.
"The man was not insincere. He believes what he does," Ms. Clayton said. "He wasn't just doing it for political benefit."
On the Christian right, his nomination was applauded. "In his time in the United States Senate, religious liberty was one of his top priorities, not only for Christians but for religious minorities around the world," said Gary Bauer, a prominent Christian activist.
Aaron Estabrook, executive director of the Save Kansas Coalition, which has criticized Mr. Brownback and advocated political moderation, said he was "relieved" to know the governor was moving on.
"I think good leaders acknowledge mistakes, and they adjust," Mr. Estabrook said, "and he just never did that."

Full text: Stock indexes inched further into uncharted territory on Wednesday after AT&T, Boeing and others joined the parade of big companies reporting stronger profits than analysts expected. Stocks that pay big dividends were particularly strong after the Federal Reserve took a pause in its slow-moving campaign to lift interest rates, causing Treasury yields to sink lower. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index edged up by 0.70 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 2,477.83 and added a whisper to its record high set a day earlier.
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 97.58 points, or 0.5 percent, to 21,711.01, and the Nasdaq composite rose 10.57 points, or 0.2 percent, to 6,422.75. Both are at record highs.
While announcing its decision to hold short-term rates steady, the Federal Reserve said that it may begin paring the $4.5 trillion balance sheet it built up after the financial crisis "relatively soon," which some analysts took to mean as September. The Fed also said that inflation is expected to remain below its target of 2 percent in the short term.
After the Fed's announcement, drops for Treasury yields accelerated, and the 10-year yield fell to 2.29 percent from 2.33 percent late Tuesday.
The best-performing area of the market was the telecommunications sector, which jumped after AT&T reported stronger second-quarter earnings than Wall Street had forecast. Its stock rose $1.81, or 5 percent, to $38.03.
Boeing was the top-performing stock, and it had its best day in more than eight years after it raised its forecast for earnings this year and reported better-than-expected earnings for the second quarter. It jumped $20.99, or 9.9 percent, to $233.45.
"We've seen some pretty strong results from important companies," said John Wilson, senior equity portfolio manager at Columbia Threadneedle. "They're delivering very strong revenue and profit growth. That's encouraging, especially given the fact that markets have had a pretty good move."
The S.&P. 500 is already up nearly 11 percent for the year on the expectation that corporate profits will continue to rise, and the stronger profits help to validate the big gains.
Akamai Technologies fell to the sharpest loss in the S.&P. 500 despite reporting better-than-expected second-quarter results. It gave a forecast for third-quarter revenue and other measures that were lower than analysts were expecting, and its stock dropped $7.79, or 14.6 percent, to $45.49.
For the first time in seven weeks, benchmark United States crude topped $48 a barrel. It climbed 86 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $48.75 a barrel. Gold fell $2.70 to $1,249.40 an ounce.

How Food in Venezuela Went From Subsidized to Scarce

Full text: Venezuela was once the richest country in South America, but food prices have skyrocketed in recent years, forcing many to scavenge for things to eat. The monthly cost of basic groceries is now about five times the minimum wage. On July 1, the monthly minimum wage was raised for the third time this year, to increase workers' purchasing power. Still, the increase does little to help struggling families, and the country's inflation rate could reach 720 percent this year, according to the International Monetary Fund.
Since April, protesters have taken to the streets, demanding international food aid and early presidential elections. More than 90 people have been killed in the demonstrations. A local human rights group reported that more than 4,500 people have been arrested.
Here are the factors that led to the food crisis.
Venezuela overspent during a period of high oil prices.
Elected in 1998, President Hugo Chávez became widely popular for his promise to share the country's oil wealth with the poor and to guarantee food security. To fund his "21st Century Socialism" agenda, he relied on oil revenue, which accounted for 93 percent of exports in 2008.
The government imported goods and sold them at subsidized prices to make food affordable to the country's poor.
When oil prices collapsed, government spending became unsustainable.
By late 2014, oil money stopped flowing in. Venezuela had saved little from the oil price boom of the 2000s. Under Mr. Chávez's successor, President Nicolás Maduro, the country slashed imports and used thinning reserves to pay its foreign debt and avoid default. As a result, food and medicine became scarce.
Compounding the problem, a series of government actions paralyzed local food production.
For years, oil revenue enabled the government to import most consumer goods. Meanwhile, the government increased regulations, stifling domestic production. When the country cut imports, weakened local producers could not keep up with demand.
Seizing private property The government tried to redistribute the country's wealth by aggressively taking over hundreds of private companies and hundreds of thousands of acres of land. This policy was designed to shift ownership from private hands to government control, said Daniel Varnagy, a professor at Simón Bolívar University. But the seized assets were poorly managed, further weakening domestic production.
Controlling currency exchange Private companies that survived the government seizures faced additional hurdles. The government created currency exchange controls in 2003, becoming the sole administrator of American dollars in the country. Most private companies struggled to buy the dollars they needed to import raw materials and machinery to produce goods locally, said Ricardo Hausmann, director of the Center for International Development at Harvard's Kennedy School. This opened the door to a currency black market, where a dollar can now be sold for more than 700 times its value at the official rate.
The government further restricted access to United States dollars after oil prices crashed, giving the public sector priority access and forcing more private companies to the black market. Unable to afford prices on the black market, many cut imports, leading to even more products vanishing from the shelves.
Regulating production With fewer subsidies on products, the government enacted the Fair Price Law to keep costs affordable. The new law regulated the production, distribution and pricing of products. These measures made many companies unprofitable, causing them to stop producing and worsening shortages, said Félix Seijas, a professor at the Central University of Venezuela. In addition to the high costs, farmers complained that fertilizer and farming equipment were mostly unavailable, and if a piece of machinery broke, the entire supply chain could shut down.
But the government blames an "economic war" waged by its opposition and foreign enemies for the food scarcity, accusing private companies of intentionally cutting back production in an attempt to destabilize the country.
As a result, Venezuelans have turned to expensive imports or to the black market. For many people, staples like eggs and rice have become unaffordable.
These policies led to food scarcity and more poverty.
During the oil price boom, the percentage of households in poverty fell to 29 percent from 53 percent. The government has not released poverty data since 2015. But a survey by three of the top universities in the country indicates that in recent years the government underestimated the level of poverty, which reached 82 percent in 2016.
According to the survey, about 9.6 million people eat two or fewer meals a day and 93 percent of the population cannot afford adequate food.

The Problem With 'Skinny' Repeal

Full text: Skinny is often read as good today. We like skinny jeans, skinny models and, apparently, skinny health reform. It is likely that the Senate, which has just rejected repeal-and-replace and repeal-without-replace bills, will vote on a "skinny repeal" of the Affordable Care Act. What does this actually mean, and what would it produce? The proposal most often labeled "skinny" would repeal the insurance mandate for individuals and larger employers under the banner of choice and freedom -- both standard objectives of conservatives. It also would repeal taxes on medical-device manufacturers and, perhaps, also on insurers, with the goal of reducing the costs that must be reflected in premiums.
On the surface, both of those changes seem modest and reasonable. But I can assure Congress, as a former insurance company chief executive, that they would lead to a bloated upscale version of the Medicaid expansion so hated by conservatives. The result would be not only the loss of coverage for millions of people but also an even bigger bill for the government to pick up.
You have to look at the dynamics of the insurance market to understand this. To survive, an insurer has to predict the risk of costly claims and to obtain sufficient enrollment to balance customers who need a lot of health care with enrollees who have few or no claims. This works because while an insurer can't know the timing or severity of illness for an individual, it can estimate the average claims of a group of individuals fairly well.
In health care, some individual needs are predictable -- young people use less, and those with chronic conditions demand more. The only way to obtain a reasonable average is to have a broad pool, like the employees of a company covered by a group plan.
The individual market never had this natural grouping, so premiums varied widely, as did coverage, if it was available at all. The Obamacare individual mandate was intended to produce a representative group and to keep average premiums in bounds.
But a variety of problems resulted in predictably higher premium rates for insurance exchanges. The mandated coverage for qualified health plans was broader, enrollment was skewed by pricing that favored older customers, and risk-reduction mechanisms were insufficiently funded. Most of those can be laid at the feet of the Republican Congress and of President Trump for his sabotage in limiting enforcement of the mandate, cutting enrollment efforts and threatening to withhold the risk-sharing payments for low-income enrollees.
As a result, insurance companies' actuaries have filed rate increases in double-digit percentages based on expected higher claim costs -- fewer healthy people have signed up -- and on risks that they thought were shared by the government being shifted back to them. At the same time, underlying health care inflation is closer to about 4 percent. In addition, many insurers have simply left the market because of unpredictable government policy.
Others sticking it out have bet that their higher premiums, combined with the loss of competitors, will let them cover the higher risk. They are probably right. The widely predicted "death spiral" won't happen: Subsidies provide a low ceiling on the net premium for over three-quarters of enrollees.
So what will it mean for individuals if the mandate is jettisoned in a "skinny repeal"? Those receiving subsidies will be largely immune to higher costs -- their increased premiums will be offset by larger government subsidies -- but it's actually middle-income people without subsidies who will be priced out of the market.
Without the mandate, they will just return to their previous uninsured status, frequently turning into emergency-room patients and bad debts for hospitals and doctors. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that, in a decade, about 15 million people would be hurt, including independent professionals and small-business employees.
Those remaining in the exchanges will be receiving much higher subsidies because of the higher premiums, making them very similar to existing Medicaid beneficiaries. This is why the likely outcome is a much bigger tab for the government.
In effect, a "skinny repeal" will result in an unintended expansion of ever larger government subsidies to the working poor. The difference is that those people will have higher incomes than allowed under normal Medicaid or the expanded Medicaid coverage that has been so controversial in red states.
Some liberals may consider this extension of Medicaid-like coverage to be good policy that provides an on-ramp for the working poor to higher incomes and jobs with benefits. Yet the loss of insurance for millions of others is a steep cost for that expansion.
Those Republicans who advocate "skinny repeal" as just a lighter version of "repeal and replace" are likely to be very surprised at the unintended result. Most important, this piecemeal approach is no way to do health policy.

Federal Reserve to Start Winding Down $4 Trillion in Stimulus Soon

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve moved into the ready position Wednesday for the next phase of its retreat from its post-crisis economic stimulus campaign. In a statement after a two-day meeting of its policy-making committee, the Fed said it would start reducing its bond holdings "relatively soon" so long as moderate economic growth continues. The Fed remains officially sanguine about lower than expected inflation. The stance is likely to reinforce market expectations that the Fed will take action to increase borrowing costs at its next meeting, in September. Rather than raising its benchmark rate, the Fed is expected to announce it will begin to reduce its bond holdings.
The Fed accumulated more than $4 trillion in Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities as part of its campaign to reduce borrowing costs for businesses and consumers. Under its exit plan, which it described in June, it would gradually reduce those holdings -- initially at the slow pace of $10 billion a month.
The Fed has held borrowing costs at low levels since the financial crisis to increase economic activity by encouraging borrowing and risk-taking. The agency is now trying to raise costs to reduce those incentives.
By the end of the year, the Fed projects that interest rates could return to a level that would neither encourage nor discourage economic activity.
So far, however, markets have largely shaken off the Fed's retreat. Borrowing costs remain low and loan terms have shown little sign of tightening. Some measures show financial conditions have eased since the Fed began its retreat.
At its last meeting, in June, the Fed raised its benchmark interest rate for the third consecutive quarter, to a range of 1 percent to 1.25 percent. The agency also described its plans for reducing its bond holdings, a process that analysts expect to begin at the Fed's next meeting.
Those steps reflected the Fed's confidence in the health of the economy.
Since then, however, some Fed officials have expressed concern about continued weakness in inflation. The agency's preferred measure declined in the last three monthly reports, to 1.4 percent in May from an annualized pace of 2.1 percent in February.
The Fed aims to keep inflation at a 2 percent annual rate. While high and rising inflation is economically disruptive, lower inflation can cause problems, too.
Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, has been the most vocal among Fed officials in warning that the agency may be raising interest rates too quickly. He voted against the quarter-point rate increases in March and in June. Several other members of the Fed's policy-making committee have expressed concern about weak inflation in recent weeks.
Janet L. Yellen, the Fed's chairwoman, has acknowledged the recent weakness, but she has said that she expects inflation to rebound. Job growth remains strong, with most Fed officials seeing a tight labor market that is likely to result in higher prices.
The Fed has predicted one more rate increase this year, but analysts do not expect a decision earlier than December, so the Fed has time to consider the incoming data.
Some investors saw evidence in the Fed's statement that the central bank is a little less likely to raise rates in December. The dollar weakened against foreign currencies, continuing a recent trend. The dollar's exchange value reflects market perceptions of the relative strength of the American economy compared with the rest of the world.
Stock indexes rose after the 2 p.m. announcement, as equity investors like low rates. The S.&P. 500 index ended the day up very slightly at 2,477.83. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury fell slightly because bond investors like high rates.
Analysts saw little evidence of a shift in the Fed's monetary policy plans.
"We think the Fed has laid out its policy plans quite clearly and it is unlikely to deviate from them unless there is a very dramatic change to inflation and employment trends," said Rick Rieder, BlackRock's chief investment officer of global fixed income.
Michael Feroli, chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase, said investors were overanalyzing minor changes in the Fed's wording.
"We don't sense a significant loss of confidence from the FOMC that inflation will return to target over time," he said, referring to the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's policy panel.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The United States has a problem: not enough inflation. That notion is a bit of a head-scratcher. Most people don't like inflation. They would prefer that a dollar tomorrow be worth the same as a dollar today.
But a recent drop in inflation may be a sign of fresh economic weakness and is perplexing to Federal Reserve officials who are now wrapping up the central bank's stimulus campaign.
The Federal Reserve thinks modest inflation has important economic benefits, and it has aimed since 2012 to keep prices rising at an annual pace of 2 percent. The problem is that the Fed is on track to fail for the sixth straight year. Inflation has been stubbornly sluggish.
A little inflation can brighten the economic mood, causing wages and corporate profits to rise more quickly. Economists like to point out that this is an illusion. If everyone is making more money, then no one can buy more stuff. Prices just go up. But the evidence suggests people enjoy the illusion and, importantly, they respond to the illusion by behaving in ways that increase actual economic growth, for example by working harder.
The Fed's chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, told Congress this month that she expects inflation to rebound. But she said the Fed could change course if weakness persists, by, for example, not moving forward with additional interest rate increases.
"It's premature to reach the judgment that we're not on the path to 2 percent inflation over the next couple of years," Ms. Yellen said. "We're watching this very closely and stand ready to adjust our policy if it appears the inflation undershoot will be persistent."
The Fed's policy-making committee will meet Tuesday and Wednesday but it is expected to defer major decisions until later in the year. Analysts expect the Fed to announce in September that it will start to reduce its holdings of Treasuries and mortgage bonds. The Fed is expected to leave its benchmark interest rate unchanged at least until December.
"If you see inflation running below target persistently, for so long, it's really hard to get around the idea that, despite everything, monetary policy has actually not delivered sufficient accommodation," said Peter Ireland, an economist at Boston College. "It's a reason not to clamor for additional rate hikes on top of what we've already seen."
The United States learned to fear inflation in the 1970s. It was a period of profound economic uncertainty. Prices rose up to 10 percent a year, and restaurants used stickers to update prices on menus. High inflation encouraged people to borrow heavily and spend quickly; it discouraged long-term planning and investment, and corporate profits fell sharply.
Under Paul Volcker, the Fed gradually brought inflation under control by driving the economy into a deep recession. By the mid-1990s, it seemed plausible the Fed could eliminate inflation completely. But Ms. Yellen, then a new Fed governor, was among those who argued successfully that it would be better to maintain moderate inflation.
A little inflation helps the economy rebound from recessions. It gives the Fed more room to reduce borrowing costs, and it also eases necessary economic adjustments. Employers, for example, can cut costs by holding wage increases below the inflation rate.
Inflation can also brighten the economic mood by raising wages and profits more quickly.
And a little inflation also keeps the economy at a safe distance from deflation. When prices fall, growth tends to stall as people wait for even lower prices.
The current debate, however, is mostly about inflation's role as an economic barometer.
Fed officials began the year expressing confidence that inflation was finally rebounding as the economy continued to expand. But the Fed's preferred measure of inflation declined in the last three monthly reports, from an annualized pace of 2.1 percent in February to 1.4 percent in May. The inflation gauge is published by the Commerce Department.
Job growth remains strong, but recent reports on cautious consumer spending and business investment suggest that overall growth remains tepid. A turn toward stronger growth again has failed to materialize. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, which predicted the economy would expand at an annualized pace of 4 percent in the second quarter, now estimates second-quarter growth was 2.5 percent.
The persistent sluggishness has convinced some Fed officials to revise their thinking.
"Low inflation has been the major surprise of the era," James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, declared last April. He said he did not support any increases in the Fed's benchmark rate until 2018, to give inflation time to recover.
Last month, Mr. Bullard said he was still waiting for inflation to return to 2 percent.
Most Fed officials, however, continue to predict that inflation is around the corner.
One theory, popular among conservative economists, is that the Fed causes inflation by increasing the supply of money faster than the pace of economic growth. Kevin A. Hassett, President Trump's nominee to lead his Council of Economic Advisers, was among the signatories of a 2010 open letter warning that the Fed's plans to pump money into the banking system "risk currency debasement and inflation." Seven years later, there is no evidence they were correct, although some of them continue to issue similar warnings.
Another theory, more popular among liberal economists like Ms. Yellen, holds that prices rise as unemployment falls. Companies compete for workers by raising wages, workers want to spend the money and businesses respond to the demand for their products by raising prices.
Ms. Yellen has attributed the recent weakness to declines in the prices of particular goods, like cellphone-service plans and prescription drugs, that are not likely to continue. She and other officials also have noted that the weakness of the global economy allowed the United States to import foreign goods at low prices.
This theory, too, is increasingly difficult to reconcile with recent evidence.
The unemployment rate, at 4.4 percent in June, was below the level that Fed officials regard as inflationary for the fourth straight month. Meanwhile, inflation weakened.
So where does that leave us? Once again, as it was in the days of high inflation, public expectations might be determining the level of inflation, some economists think. The Fed's repeated failure to achieve its stated goals may be training people to expect lower inflation, making it harder for the Fed to achieve those goals.
"The public makes inferences regarding the inflation target based on our past performance, not just on our words," Charles Evans, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said in a June speech in New York. "When they see inflation below 2 percent for eight-plus years, they might logically think 2 percent is a ceiling."
Another countervailing view emphasizes the importance of real economic conditions. Low inflation has become the standard condition across the developed world, and some economists see the rise of the developing world as the most likely explanation. The threat of outsourcing helps to hold down wages, while the flood of cheap goods from foreign countries helps to hold down prices.
Adam Posen, the president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, says the bottom line is that the last few years have raised doubts about all of the standard explanations. Policy makers are sailing without the guidance of a convincing model.
"It's reached the point where the only decision is how freaked out you want to be by how much this contradicts previous knowledge or previous theory," Mr. Posen said.

Full text: Here's a look at what's coming up this week. OIL INDUSTRY
Compliance with output cuts is slipping.
Oil officials from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other large producers like Russia and Oman are expected to meet on Monday in St. Petersburg, Russia, to review the output cuts agreed on last year. The attendees have plenty to talk about, with oil prices now about $48 a barrel for Brent crude. OPEC compliance with the reductions is slipping. Ecuador, an OPEC member though a small producer, said this month that it would not meet the terms of the agreement and would raise output because it needed the revenue. Iraq is also producing well over its quota. The biggest issue is that rising production from Libya and Nigeria, both OPEC members that are exempt from the agreement, is offsetting much of the impact of the cuts. Stanley Reed
ECONOMY
Britain girds for 'Brexit' with talks in U.S. and Mexico.
Liam Fox, the British international trade secretary, will seek to forge deeper commercial ties with the United States and Mexico this week as part of efforts to prepare for his country's departure from the European Union. The visit, including an inaugural meeting on Monday of a United States-United Kingdom trade and investment working group, is vitally important to his country's goal of bolstering trans-Atlantic trade after "Brexit," as the British exit from the European Union is known. Later in the week, Mr. Fox will travel to Mexico to meet with Ildefonso Guajardo, the minister of economy, to seek ways of maintaining trade ties once Britain leaves the European bloc. The British meetings are a delicate matter for relations between London and Brussels. That is because Britain is not allowed to conclude deals on its own before it leaves the European Union. James Kanter
TECHNOLOGY
The major internet companies will report earnings.
A fistful of report cards from the major internet companies will arrive this week in the form of earnings announcements from Amazon and Twitter on Thursday, Facebook on Wednesday and Alphabet, the parent company of Google, on Monday. Wall Street is expecting Amazon, Facebook and Alphabet to continue to demonstrate their dominance of internet commerce, social media and search, which has made them three of the most highly valued companies in the world. Investors will look for Twitter to show that it is becoming a potent advertising medium, not just President Trump's favorite communications channel. Nick Wingfield
AUTO INDUSTRY
Will the slowdown in sales show up on the bottom line?
The three Detroit automakers report second-quarter earnings this week, and analysts will be looking for any sign that the slowdown in sales in the United States this year is hurting their bottom line. General Motors and Ford have reported strong profits because of brisk sales of high-margin trucks and sport utility vehicles as well as steady growth in China. But industry sales have slumped in their home market this year. Fiat Chrysler is generally less profitable than its crosstown rivals. G.M. will report on Tuesday, followed by Ford on Wednesday and Fiat Chrysler on Thursday. Neal E. Boudette
ECONOMY
No policy making is expected from the Fed. Worries? Maybe.
The Federal Reserve's policy-making committee is not likely to make policy when it meets Tuesday and Wednesday. Fed officials are deferring decisions until later in the year. The Fed already has raised its benchmark interest rate twice this year as it retreats from its post-crisis economic stimulus campaign. Analysts expect the Fed to announce at its next meeting, in September, that it will begin to reduce its bond holdings, another step toward normalcy. The July meeting is largely a place holder, but the Fed will update its economic outlook on Wednesday. The crucial question is how worried are Fed officials about a recent downturn in inflation? Binyamin Appelbaum
BANKING
Will Europe's big banks keep pace with U.S. counterparts?
European banks will be in focus this week as some of the region's largest lenders are expected to report their second-quarter results. Deutsche Bank, Banco Santander of Spain, the British banks Barclays and Lloyds Banking Group, and the Swiss banks Credit Suisse and UBS are all expected to update investors on their results for the three months ending in June.
Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley reported generally positive quarters, aside from their trading operations, where results remained weak. Investors will look to see if Europe's banks kept pace. Investors will also be watching closely for litigation costs for the European banks. Chad Bray
OIL INDUSTRY
As producers report earnings, investors will look for cost cutting.
Most of the world's major oil companies are expected to report second-quarter earnings this week. Royal Dutch Shell, the largest European oil company, will report on Thursday, along with Total of France and Norway's Statoil. The American giants Exxon Mobil and Chevron will follow on Friday, along with Italy's Eni. Earnings should be helped by slightly higher oil prices than last year's second quarter as well as zealous cost-cutting. But with oil prices still under pressure, analysts say, investors will want to see further spending cuts. Stanley Reed
ECONOMY
Growth is expected, but perhaps below the rate once anticipated.
On Friday at 8:30 a.m., the Commerce Department will report its initial estimate of economic growth in the second quarter. Experts are forecasting growth of 2.5 percent on an annual basis, above the 1.4 percent rate recorded in the first quarter but well below the 3 percent-plus pace many economists had been anticipating a few months ago. If the number is weaker than expected, it will be another reminder that the economy's underlying growth rate isn't much better -- or worse -- than it has been since the current recovery began eight years ago. Nelson D. Schwartz
AUTO INDUSTRY
Tesla will deliver its first Model 3 sedans.
The electric carmaker Tesla plans on Friday to deliver the first of its highly anticipated Model 3 sedans to customers, a turning point for the company in its efforts to produce a battery-powered vehicle for the mass market. Tesla's chief executive, Elon Musk, will celebrate the event with employees at the company's assembly plant in Fremont, Calif., and provide updates for investors and analysts on production targets for the Model 3, which is expected to be priced at about $35,000 and serve as an anchor for Tesla's long-term expansion plans.

Full text: CARACAS, Venezuela -- Motley throngs of masked antigovernment protesters hurl rocks, fireworks and Molotov cocktails. The police and soldiers retaliate with tear gas, water cannon blasts, rubber bullets and buckshot. An uprising is brewing in Venezuela.
Nearly every day for more than three months, thousands have taken to the streets to vent fury at President Nicolás Maduro and his increasingly repressive leadership.
These confrontations often turn into lopsided and sometimes lethal street brawls -- more than 90 people have been killed and more than 3,000 arrested.
I have worked as a photojournalist for The New York Times in Venezuela for nine years, and for the past two have focused on the plight of Venezuelans struggling with the worst economic crisis in the country's history.
I have witnessed their growing anger as food and medicine disappear and Mr. Maduro's authoritarianism intensifies.
His government has delayed elections while jailing protesters and political opponents. Now he has called for a new constituent assembly to be elected at the end of the month, empowered to rewrite the Constitution, which many Venezuelans have called a blatant power grab and threat to their democracy.
Mr. Maduro has called the protests a violent attempt to overthrow his government. Demonstrators say they are invoking their right to rebellion against tyranny, guaranteed by the Constitution he wants to revise.
I often start my day now hopping onto a motorcycle taxi and heading to the front lines where the tear gas is wafting and the projectiles are flying.
I've come to know some of the regular protesters, like Tyler, 22, a former government supporter who has become adept at dodging rubber bullets and buckshot behind a homemade shield painted blue, yellow and red to match the Venezuelan flag knotted around his neck. His eyes peek from the black T-shirt wrapped around his face to hide his identity.
We sat beside a burning barricade during a lull and he told me about his family.
Tyler said he was fighting because of medicine shortages that killed his mother, worsened his grandmother's high blood pressure and left his asthmatic little sister gasping. He said his family could afford only one meal a day, usually just plain white rice.
"We are living with a hunger that we have never had before," he said. "Things are already really ugly here, and we won't take it anymore."
Tyler joined La Resistencia -- the ragtag street protesters who clash regularly with government security forces.
Members of La Resistencia say taking to the streets is the only option left.
"If they don't kill us here protesting, we will die either way -- be killed for a cellphone or a pair of sneakers -- or we will die of hunger, or die simply from catching any disease because there is no medicine here," said Marco, a graduate student.
I feel as if I am inside a video game when photographing the front lines -- constantly skipping over obstacles and dodging projectiles whizzing from all directions. Dozens of antagonists get hit during each protest, some evacuated with broken bones and bloody wounds.
Unfortunately for the press corps, both sides have less-than-perfect aim. We are frequently pelted with rocks, paint and water cannons. I took a buckshot blast to the helmet from roughly 15 yards that gave me a concussion. Many photographers have fared worse, hospitalized with serious injuries.
Security forces regularly target journalists, beating and arresting them, smashing or seizing their cameras. More than 200 "acts of aggression" against journalists have been reported since the protests began.
Sometimes the protesters hijack 18-wheelers to block the main Francisco Fajardo Highway through Caracas.
They have beaten captured soldiers and police officers and burned their motorcycles. They also have committed mob vigilantism.
When a man was accused of stealing during a protest, Resistencia members punched and stabbed him, doused him with gasoline and set him afire. The man, Orlando Figuera, died days later.
When armored military vehicles aim water cannons to disperse protesters, Resistencia members sometimes fire back with giant slingshots, manned by four people each. Their artillery rounds are baby-food jars full of paint or even human excrement.
"It's nasty," one protester said, "but everyone has it, and most important, it's free."
The protesters also improvise to protect themselves. Some turn swim goggles and plastic soda bottles into makeshift gas masks, and create shinguards from old magazines and duct tape.
Others have fashioned armor from carpet scraps to thwart rubber bullets and buckshot, lethal at close range. More than 30 protesters have died this way, according to a tally by local journalists.
"Don't knock it," one protester said with a grin when asked about his carpet vest. "It has already saved me several times."
Many carry homemade shields of wood and old oil drums. Some are adorned with Venezuelan flags, cartoons of Mr. Maduro burning the Constitution or phrases like "freedom, future, elections now!" and "I love you, mom."
Members of La Resistencia are generally young and say they support neither the government nor the opposition politicians. Some are middle-class university students who fight with cameras affixed to their skateboard helmets to update their Instagram pages.
The peaceful demonstrators vary widely. Young, old, professionals and unemployed join sit-ins and actions to block streets. Hundreds of thousands have marched toward government offices. Almost always, security forces violently block them.
During the March for Health, thousands of doctors, nurses and patients protested the crippled public health system. They held signs made from empty drug boxes with messages like "S.O.S." and "without medicine, they're also killing us."
When soldiers used tear gas on them, doctors in white lab coats locked arms -- gagging with tears streaming -- but refused to budge.
In another march, Catholic priests, nuns and other religious protesters carried a large Virgin Mary decorated with the national flag. A nun in white carried a sign with the line from Scripture, "We must obey God rather than men."
At the March of the Empty Pots, families banged on cookware to protest food shortages and soaring prices. A recent poll found that 90 percent of Venezuelans say they cannot afford the food they need.
Gustavo Misle, 80, a retired university professor, regularly attends the protests holding an old Halloween skeleton cutout repurposed with a sign, "I am hungry."
He once ran a nonprofit that fed homeless children. Now he and his wife survive on bananas. Inflation has ravaged his monthly pension, worth only a few dollars.
The homemade protective gear is no guarantee of safety. Neomar Lander, 17, was wearing a carpet vest when he died on the front lines. Comrades placed candles around the bloodstained spot where he fell, keeping vigil until late into the night.
Johan Caldera, a friend of Mr. Lander's, said he was even more determined to protest.
"Now, I have no fear, because I already lost the fear I had, and the respect for the military," he said.
"The real soldiers of Venezuela wear rags on their faces," he said. "They don't use grenades -- they use stones."
Many Resistencia members wear T-shirts resembling the uniform of Simón Bolívar, who led the rebellion for Venezuela's independence from Spain. They sometimes plead with soldiers to join them, quoting Bolívar: "When tyranny makes law, rebellion is a right."
Wuilly Arteaga, 23, a violinist who became a symbolic figure in the protests for playing the national anthem at the front lines, cried when the police broke his violin. Videos of Mr. Arteaga in tears went viral. He was flown to the United States, where two prominent musicians, Marc Anthony and Oscarcito, gave him a new violin.
Mr. Arteaga was injured on Saturday in violent clashes between security forces and protesters at a march on the Supreme Court in support of alternative magistrates appointed Friday by the opposition. "Neither rubber bullets nor pellets will stop our fight for Venezuela's independence," Mr. Arteaga posted later on Twitter. "Tomorrow I will be back in the streets."
After an earlier day of clashes, hundreds of soldiers retreated, their ammunition exhausted. Members of La Resistencia celebrated as they retook the main highway, raising their fists and singing the national anthem.
"Glory to the brave people, who shook off the yoke," they sang. "Off with the chains! Off with the chains!" the song continues. "Death to oppression!"
The government calls Resistencia members terrorists and has threatened a more muscular military response. "If Venezuela was plunged into chaos and violence and the Bolivarian Revolution destroyed, we would go to combat," President Maduro said.
At the vigil for Mr. Lander, a fellow Resistencia member squatted, his Converse high-tops touching the spot where Mr. Lander was killed, and vowed to stay in the street until the government falls.
Staring into my camera, he had this message for the president: "Take a good look at my face, because I am not afraid."

Full text: CORRECTION APPENDED. Two federal investigations -- one examining opioid sales, another about a multiple sclerosis drug whose price had soared to $34,000 a vial -- were only part of the troubles Mallinckrodt faced as the year began.
The stock of the drug maker, whose United States headquarters are in St. Louis, was tanking. Wall Street worried that Medicare might reduce the half-billion dollars it was spending yearly on a Mallinckrodt drug with limited evidence of effectiveness.
This year, the company left the industry trade group Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, or PhRMA, after the group threatened to kick out companies that did not spend enough on research.
Mallinckrodt, however, has been increasing its spending in another area: It has been writing checks to politicians.
After making meager donations in 2015, the company's political action committee began raising its contributions for congressional campaigns last year. Lawmakers in both the House and Senate collected $44,000 from Mallinckrodt in 2017's first quarter, nearly nine times what they got from the company in the same period two years ago.
Mallinckrodt also spent $610,000 lobbying Congress, triple the amount of 2015's first quarter. The company, which makes pain-control drugs as well as H. P. Acthar, an injectable gel prescribed for multiple sclerosis and other diseases, has lobbied on issues related to opioids, patents, Medicare and other matters, regulatory filings show.
Mallinckrodt is far from unique. This year, a critical and risky one for drug companies, the industry as a whole is ratcheting up campaign donations and its presence on Capitol Hill, a new database compiled by Kaiser Health News shows.
(Did your representative receive money from a pharmaceutical political action committee? Look your representative up here »)
"The stakes are really high right now," said David Maris, who follows pharmaceutical stocks for Wells Fargo, given that President Trump has joined Democrats to demand action on drug costs.
Mallinckrodt acknowledges that it has increased its political spending to help its particular causes. "We actively participate in the political process on issues that matter to us and our patients," Rhonda Sciarra, a Mallinckrodt spokeswoman, said by email. "Our PAC's absolute spend remains small in relation to other companies in our industry."
Congressional donations from pharmaceutical PACs rose 11 percent in this year's first quarter, compared with the first three months of 2015 (the comparable point in the previous election cycle), according to a Kaiser Health News analysis. The increase accompanied a spike in pharma lobbying for the period.
Contributions to powerful committee members who handle health policy matters also increased in the face of public anger over the opioid crisis as well as anticipated renewal of legislation that determines the "user fees" companies pay for regulatory drug approval.
A dozen Republican committee heads and ranking Democrats on health-related panels collected $281,600 from pharma-related PACs in the first quarter, up 80 percent from what people in the same positions collected in the first quarter of 2015, the data shows. Such initial donations often set the pace for a two-year election cycle, and suggest whom corporate interests are trying to cultivate in a new Congress, with implied promises of more to come, analysts say.
For pharma companies, "now would be the time to give out the money, ahead of a piece of legislation that may come down the road," said Kent Cooper, a former Federal Election Commission official who has tracked political money for decades.
"You want to get your name out there and make a connection with these members' legislative assistants -- so you are known to them and you can get in their door," Mr. Cooper said.
Other drug makers increasing their congressional donations include AbbVie -- whose blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis injection, Humira, faces threats from competition -- and Alexion Pharmaceuticals. A six-figure price tag for Soliris, Alexion's treatment for a rare blood disorder, makes it one of the world's most expensive drugs.
Pfizer, the No. 2 pharma donor in the first quarter after Sanofi, gave $130,900 to congressional campaigns, three times its contribution for the same period two years ago. So far this year, the company has raised the price of dozens of drugs by an average of 20 percent, The Financial Times reported.
PhRMA, a big giver in the past, has not yet joined individual companies in increasing donations for this election cycle. Congressional campaigns collected $7,000 in the first quarter from PhRMA, which Politico reported had raised member dues to prepare for the drug-price fight. They got $31,500 two years ago.
The totals do not include contributions from individual executives and lobbyists, or donations to leadership PACs. Leadership PACs associated with a particular member of Congress often spend money on other members' campaigns, as well as on things that a campaign committee cannot finance. Details on contributions to leadership PACs take longer to become available.
Outrage was still bubbling last year over moves by Turing Pharmaceuticals and Mylan to raise prices of cheap-to-make, lifesaving drugs to hundreds of dollars a dose, when the country elected a Republican president who vowed: "I'm going to bring down drug prices." Nearly eight Americans in 10 said in a September poll they believed prescription drug prices were unreasonable.
Evidence has grown that pharma companies helped fuel the nation's addiction and overdose crisis with sales of powerful painkillers, prompting calls for an overhaul. Drug developers are also preparing for renewal of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, which generates revenue to pay for government review and approval of drugs.
At the same time, drug companies anticipated Republican efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, which finances billions in drug sales. That process has stalled in the Senate. All of this gives drug makers the most powerful incentives in years to cultivate policy makers, analysts say.
Tense politics may also be prompting members of Congress to be energetic about soliciting donations.
"My sense is that Republicans are nervous in the House -- especially given the long-term record of the presidential party losing seats in the midterm," said David Magleby, a political scientist at Brigham Young University who studies campaign finance. "I would be surprised if Republican incumbents across the board aren't more aggressive in raising money in the first and second quarters."
In the last six months, Mallinckrodt has come under pressure for both painkiller sales and price increases for nonnarcotic drugs. Earlier this month, the Justice Department announced the company would pay $35 million to resolve an investigation into whether it ignored enormous volumes of its oxycodone moving through distributors and pharmacies. Over several years, The Washington Post reported, Mallinckrodt was responsible for two-thirds of all the oxycodone sold in Florida.
Mallinckrodt denied it violated the law and said the settlement was not an acknowledgment of liability.
In January, it agreed to pay $100 million to settle Federal Trade Commission allegations that a company it bought three years ago had illegally quashed competition, enabling it to raise the price of Acthar, the multiple sclerosis drug, which the F.T.C. said cost only $40 per vial in 2001, to $34,000. Mallinckrodt disputed the agency's complaint but said it settled to put the matter to rest.
The drug is prescribed to treat a rare form of epilepsy as well as multiple sclerosis and other ailments. Even Mallinckrodt acknowledges that "clinical trials demonstrating the efficacy for Acthar are limited."
But in part because of price increases, global sales of the drug soared from $951 million in the 2014 fiscal year to $1.2 billion in the 2016 fiscal year. It was Medicare's most expensive drug per patient in 2015 -- $162,371 for the year -- and now makes up a third of the company's revenue.
Company shareholders have worried that Medicare will crack down on sales of Acthar. Mallinckrodt has pledged to keep future price increases for all drugs to single-digit percentages per year, though that could still be well above the current inflation rate of less than 3 percent.
Mallinckrodt's biggest donations on Capitol Hill, of $5,000 each, went to Ann Wagner, a House member from its home state, Missouri, and Senator Orrin G. Hatch, the powerful chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. That amount is the maximum a PAC can give to a campaign committee for each primary and general election.
Ever since it was spun off as an independent company in 2013, Mallinckrodt has made its legal home in Ireland, which allows it to take advantage of lower income tax rates. Mr. Hatch favors cutting United States corporate taxes to eliminate incentives to make such moves.
Mallinckrodt gave lesser amounts to 16 other congressional campaigns, including that of Paul D. Ryan, the House speaker. Mr. Ryan, who has played down Mr. Trump's attacks on the pharmaceutical industry, was the top recipient of industry money in the first quarter, with $82,750 collected, the data shows.
The White House has made no proposals on drug costs. Mr. Trump has said little about the issue since January, when he said drug sellers were "getting away with murder."
Drug companies are hedging their bets, writing checks to individual Democrats and Republicans. With Mr. Trump breaking ranks with Republicans to favor reform, "You can't tell who's your friend and who's not," said Mr. Maris, the Wells Fargo analyst. "So you have to go to a ground game -- a more one-on-one legislator basis."
Correction: July 26, 2017, Wednesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Saturday about political spending by the drugmaker Mallinckrodt misstated the global sales of the drug H.P. Acthar in the 2014 fiscal year. It was $951 million, not $123 million.

Full text: LONDON -- One was accused of trying to sabotage Britain's exit from the European Union and of treating colleagues like "pirates who have taken him prisoner." Two others were described as "dangerous and deranged." As for the man leading London's talks on "Brexit," he has been called "lazy as a toad" and "vain as Narcissus," and his colleagues "government morons." Such descriptions of Britain's leaders are perhaps not all that surprising, given the country's often colorful political wars. Except they were issued not by opponents of the governing Conservative Party, whose lawmakers are negotiating the country's departure from the 28-nation bloc, but by people in or close to it.
As discussions got serious this week in Brussels -- amid open feuding, cabinet splits and confusion over policy objectives back in London -- Britain's handling of its most important negotiations since World War II was starting to look shambolic. Nearly four months after Prime Minister Theresa May invoked Article 50, starting the clock on a two-year window to negotiate Britain's departure, little or nothing of substance has been accomplished.
With the British currency languishing, the standard of living progressively squeezed and investors starting to take fright, there is markedly less bravado in London about a new age of opportunities for a "global Britain." Amid a growing sense of drift, gone is the talk of a "red, white and blue Brexit" -- a reference to the colors of the national flag.
"I am not sure that anybody is in control at the moment," said Tim Bale, a professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London. "There are about as many views about the direction of Brexit as there are members of the cabinet."
The chaos is being met with consternation elsewhere in the European Union, where negotiators say they are beginning to wonder if the British will ever decide on a coherent strategy.
"You hear more and more voices saying, 'It is ridiculous what the Brits are doing,' " said Joachim Fritz-Vannahme, director of the Europe program at the Bertelsmann Foundation, a research institute based in Germany.
"Over the last 12 months, we have heard everything and the opposite: hard Brexit, soft Brexit, quick Brexit, long Brexit," he said. "When you follow what is coming out of Theresa May's cabinet, it is not clear what vision Britain is opting for."
To make matters worse, infighting over negotiating strategy and policies has become entangled with a leadership struggle: At least three senior cabinet members are thought to be jockeying to replace Mrs. May, whose position was severely -- perhaps fatally -- weakened when she lost a parliamentary majority in last month's election.
The prime minister is pleading for an end to the ferocious "backbiting and carping" in the Conservative Party, and she lectured her cabinet this week on the importance of keeping internal discussions confidential.
Her pleas came after reports that the chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, had said at a recent cabinet meeting that public sector workers -- who are subject to a cap on pay increases of 1 percent, when inflation is more than 2.5 percent -- were overpaid compared with their counterparts in the private sector.
Mr. Hammond, who has led the "soft Brexit" faction that favors prioritizing the economy over considerations like immigration, then publicly blamed those seeking a quick, clean break from the European Union for the leaks.
Against this tumultuous backdrop, David Davis, the British secretary of state for exiting the European Union, was photographed with colleagues in Brussels on Monday sitting at the negotiating table without any documents or notes, while their European Union counterparts had sheaves of position papers before them.
Things went only marginally better on Thursday, when the European Union's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, emerged from a meeting in Brussels with Mr. Davis to lament that he still had no idea of Britain's positions on the most basic issues, like how much the country will owe the bloc in its so-called divorce bill.
Officially, Britain is still pursuing the vision of a clean break with the European Union that Mrs. May outlined in January, one that prioritizes immigration and the supremacy of British courts -- even over the interests of the economy.
Unfortunately for Mrs. May, voters hinted last month that they did not support that approach. With a shortage of nurses and doctors in the National Health Service, among other labor shortfalls, there is a growing realization that Britain is dependent on foreign workers.
As a result, the prime minister's plan for the withdrawal may not have the support of a majority of her cabinet, let alone of Parliament -- a challenge she must contend with while fighting to keep her job and as potential successors circle.
Logic suggests that, given the divisive nature of the withdrawal from the European Union and the Conservatives' recent electoral showing, the party should shift to a softer approach in negotiations, perhaps enlisting the support of lawmakers from the opposition Labour Party. But the leadership struggle is taking precedence.
"The national interest and parliamentary arithmetic would dictate some kind of grand coalition on Brexit," Mr. Bale said. "But the logic of the internal politics of the Conservative Party points the prime minister, and aspirant leaders, away from the obvious solution."
The contenders to succeed Mrs. May -- Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, as well as Mr. Hammond and Mr. Davis -- will ultimately be chosen by members of the Conservative Party, who tend to be emphatically supportive of leaving the bloc, and who will not tolerate backsliding into a diluted withdrawal.
So, as Mr. Hammond leads the push for a softer, less economically risky strategy, supporters of a harder exit are pushing back.
Britain is a big and diverse country that imports many goods from the Continent, which means there are incentives on both sides to strike a deal -- and Mr. Fritz-Vannahme and others say they believe a sensible outcome can be brokered.
As the clock ticks, though, British businesses are growing nervous. So far this year, investment in the auto sector has been about $840 million, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, an industry group. If that trend continues, the annual total will be well below the $3.2 billion invested in 2015, the last full year before the vote on European Union membership. Carmakers worry that leaving the European customs union would mean the imposition of tariffs and the disruption of complex international supply chains, both of which would raise their production costs.
At the same time, many banks are planning to relocate members of staff, in the expectation that firms based in London will lose the right to offer services across the European Union once Britain leaves the single market. And airlines will be affected unless a deal is reached to protect their right to fly to and from continental Europe. The budget airline easyJet has already announced plans to set up a new carrier, with headquarters in Austria, to allow it to continue operating flights across the bloc after Britain's withdrawal.
Trying to steady the ship, Justice Secretary David Lidington dismissed reports of political infighting as little more than the product of summer garden parties: "too much sun, and too much warm prosecco."
Few are buying that, however, and many analysts say they expect the feuding to continue until Mrs. May is pushed aside and a successor is named. But solving the leadership crisis may take time, which Britain can ill afford as far as the withdrawal process is concerned. And as Mrs. May herself has signaled, forcing her out could lead to a new general election that could be won by Labour and its leader, Jeremy Corbyn. So the jockeying, backbiting and carping might continue for some time.
Either way, the feuding reflects more than internecine battles among the Conservative grandees. It also reflects a growing, if belated, realization that there are few good options for Britain.
A so-called cliff-edge withdrawal that cuts many ties with the European Union without establishing new trade arrangements could lead to a sharp recession and an unpopular jolt to voters who had been promised a sunny future in a prosperous trading nation.
At the opposite end of the spectrum is what is being called the Norway option, in which Britain would leave the European Union but try to remain a part of its economic structures. That would put the country in a worse position than it is in today, forcing it to pay money to the bloc and to accept European rules without having a say in making them.
Mr. Hammond is trying to thread the needle, softening the possible economic hit a little by allowing for businesses to have a transition period to adapt to new rules.
A looming question is whether Britain should seek to replicate elements of its membership of the European Union's customs union, which eliminates tariffs on industrial goods. That could reassure big industries like the auto and pharmaceuticals sectors, and it might ease the border problem in Northern Ireland, which would have a frontier with the European Union because the Republic of Ireland, its neighbor, is a member of the bloc.
But it would most likely prevent Britain from striking trade deals with non-European nations, as supporters of leaving the union had promised.
As the negotiations progress, and the trade-offs and costs of leaving the European Union become clearer, the choices are likely to become even harder.
"Britons are not very honest with themselves," Mr. Fritz-Vannahme said. "The harder, sharper the Brexit, the harder the economic situation will be."
Perhaps it was in recognition of such troubles that Mr. Hammond offered a recent toast.
"In victory, you deserve Champagne," he told a gathering at the French Embassy in London, in a slight variation on the words of Winston Churchill. "In defeat, you need it."

Full text: PISTOIA, Italy -- As Europe's era of easy money slowly draws to a close, the talk in Frankfurt and London is of bond yields, exchange rates and core inflation. In this medieval city at the foot of the Apennines, it's all about trains. A stimulus program by the European Central Bank helped revive the train factory that is the largest employer in Pistoia, hauling the city out of a deep economic slump and putting people back to work.
But the bank is now preparing to take away that stimulus, raising an existential question for Pistoia, a case study in what central bank largess has achieved, and in what might happen when it is no longer there.
Precisely when the European Central Bank will allow interest rates to rise remains a matter of speculation. The bank made no changes to its policy at a meeting on Thursday, and Mario Draghi, the central bank's president, refused to be pinned down on any timetable.
But analysts agree that the day is not far away when places like Pistoia will have to stand on their own.
Only a few years ago Pistoia, which has a population of 92,000, was mired in economic gloom. The local factory, then owned by the Italian conglomerate Finmeccanica, had produced trains for more than a century, but the downturn was taking its toll.
The factory was short of orders and in danger of closing. It laid off hundreds of workers and put others on reduced hours. Dozens of companies that supplied it went out of business. Young people emigrated to Australia in search of better opportunities, while right-wing and populist parties exploited the insecurity to increase their influence in the local government.
"There was a lot of fear," said Jury Citera, secretary of the main union representing workers at the plant. "No one thought there was a future at the company."
Then, in early 2015, the European Central Bank announced that it would begin buying bonds, exercising its power to create money from thin air. It started with government bonds, then added debt issued by corporations to its shopping list.
All told, the bank has spent 2 trillion newly conjured euros, or $2.3 trillion, buying bonds in a bid to push down market interest rates, making borrowing cheaper and easier.
Among the bonds it bought were those issued by Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane, the government-owned company that manages the Italian rail network. It, in turn, used the money to order 39 trains for regional services.
Suddenly there was work in Pistoia again.
"A few years ago we felt like we were on a stationary bicycle, pedaling but going nowhere," said Antonella Nannetti, another union official. "Now we are moving again."
Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane had been planning to buy new trains anyway, said Stefano Pierini, its finance director. But lower interest rates helped speed up the investment and allowed a bigger order. The same principle, writ large, has helped the eurozone achieve its most solid growth in a decade.
The European Central Bank says its bond buying program does not target specific countries, let alone individual communities.
But by buying public sector and corporate bonds in grand style, the bank creates more demand and allows governments and companies to issue debt with lower interest rates than would otherwise be the case. The program's ultimate aim is to lower the cost of credit, stimulate growth and raise annual inflation closer to the official target of nearly 2 percent.
If central bank bond buying is helping companies in places like Pistoia to invest and expand, "it is definitely a positive," Benoît Coeuré, a member of the European Central Bank's executive board, said in an interview.
The purchases of corporate bonds have covered a broad range of industries across the 19 nations of the eurozone. They include debt issued by the brewers Anheuser-Busch InBev and Heineken, by the pharmaceutical makers Novartis and Roche, by the fashion eyewear maker Luxottica, and by consumer products companies including Nestlé, Unilever and a Belgian unit of Coca-Cola.
But an examination by The New York Times of the purchases, which the central bank identifies only by bond serial numbers, reveals one clear theme: infrastructure.
That is especially true in Italy.
In addition to the railroad company, the central bank has bought debt issued by Autostrade per l'Italia, which builds and manages Italian roads, as well as by utilities and energy companies. One is Hera, a waste and water management company in Bologna, which is using part of the money it raised to build a plant that will convert organic waste into natural gas.
Effectively, the European Central Bank is financing an enormous public works program in Italy.
The results are easy to see in Pistoia. Though a half-hour trip from Florence, it attracts a trickle of visitors by comparison and cannot depend on tourism for jobs. The city's only other major industry is acres of potted pines, palms and other plants lined up in neat rows, ready for export to gardens and nurseries around Europe and Asia.
Despite sunny weather, Pistoia's pedestrian zone was practically empty on Monday. Edda Iozzini was still in a good mood. "Money is in circulation again," the 66-year-old, who owns a newsstand, said between drags of a cigarette. "We're very happy in Pistoia."
Whether that feeling remains once the stimulus punch bowl is removed is an open question. After a slump that lasted a decade, growth in the eurozone has surpassed the United States', and unemployment is falling. For all intents and purposes, the credit crunch is over, analysts say.
But there remain trouble spots -- notably Italy. The country's banks are still working off an enormous backlog of problem loans, and credit remains tight.
"Quantitative easing has been very important," Emma Marcegaglia, chairwoman of the Italian oil and gas giant Eni, said in an interview. "Without it, Italy would have had a lot of problems."
But Ms. Marcegaglia said she thought the Italian economy was improving and could withstand a gradual decline in central bank stimulus.
Pistoia's prospects appear good because money flowing into the area since 2015 has been used to improve the region's competitiveness.
The Japanese industrial conglomerate Hitachi bought the train factory from Finmeccanica just as the European Central Bank released its gusher of cheap credit. Workers in Pistoia say Hitachi brought technological know-how as well as a willingness to modernize the plant. (Hitachi declined to comment for this article.)
Better technology has allowed Hitachi Rail Italy to win orders for hundreds of new trains both in Italy and abroad, including rolling stock or components for urban rail systems in Miami and Honolulu. Union leaders in Pistoia say that current orders will keep them busy for six more years at least.
The revival of the factory has restored not only the workers' livelihoods but also their pride.
"Now we feel we can show what we can do," said Marco Fontana, who represents administrative employees at the factory. "It's an opportunity to show we are real members of the European Union and not some little province."

Full text: WASHINGTON -- President Trump was fed up with the grind of health care legislation, and at a dinner with Republican senators on Monday at the White House, he let them know it. He told the lawmakers how annoyed he was with one Republican who was not there, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, who had gone on television over the weekend to oppose a Senate health care bill that once held the promise of victory for Mr. Trump. It is one thing to vote no, Mr. Trump told the group, according to one of the guests. It is another, the president said, to go on all of the Sunday shows and complain about it.
The scene on Monday night was an exasperating end for Mr. Trump to a month of negotiations between the White House and Senate Republicans in an effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama's signature domestic legacy.
The Senate bill, which faced a near-impossible path forward after the House passed its version of the legislation in May, was ultimately defeated by deep divisions within the party, a lack of a viable health care alternative and a president who, one staff member said, was growing bored in selling the bill and often undermined the best-laid plans of his aides with a quip or a tweet.
Governors, especially Republicans from states that had expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, also played a vital role in the demise of Mr. Trump's plans. "In our state," said Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, a Republican, "many people on Medicaid expansion are on the program for just a year and a half, until they get a job. They are not on it for 20 years. They are not lazy or committing fraud."
The effort by Senate Republican leaders to remake the nation's health care system -- which went well beyond the perimeters of Mr. Obama's health care law -- was in retrospect doomed from the moment it began, even with the wind of an unlikely win in the House at their backs.
The Senate measure would impose annual caps on Medicaid spending, ending what has been an open-ended entitlement for the poor and disabled. The process bypassed committees, any public airing of the bill or formal bill drafting. Instead, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, farmed out the remaking of 17 percent of the economy to a small group of senators, all Republican white men. The bad first look did not fade.
But under fire for the all-male panel, Mr. McConnell reduced it to little more than a kaffeeklatsch, open to anyone who wanted to come by and chat health care.
Republican senators, reflecting the divide in the party, quickly formed two camps: those who wanted to squeeze hundreds of billions of dollars out of Medicaid, and those, mainly from states that had expanded the program, who wanted to preserve it. Both groups held constant meetings, with many usually conservative senators like Jerry Moran of Kansas and Charles E. Grassley of Iowa sliding into the moderate group's gatherings to quietly voice their own concerns.
Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, in particular, formed the spine of opposition to the bill, and pushed for changes to reduce the cuts to Medicaid. In his state, more than 700,000 low-income people have gained coverage through the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.
Senator Susan Collins of Maine criticized the Trump administration's often specious descriptions of what the bill would actually do, bolstering other more quiet critics' resolve.
"The only change that Obamacare made in Medicaid was to give states the option of expanding coverage with increased federal funding," said Ms. Collins, who opposed the Senate legislation. "Yet the Senate bill would have cut hundreds of billions of dollars from this program, imposed an entirely new formula and reduced the reimbursement rate below the cost of medical inflation."
The changes, she added, "would have been made without the Senate holding a single hearing to evaluate the consequences on some of our most vulnerable citizens, rural hospitals and nursing homes."
Mr. McConnell in the meantime did not have enough reliable allies on the right. Mr. Paul made it clear from the start that he would not support anything but a full repeal of the law. Senators Mike Lee of Utah and Ted Cruz of Texas had repeated conversations with Republican leaders and the White House about how to make the bill sufficiently conservative. Senator Dean Heller, Republican of Nevada, dealt an early blow by suggesting he would not support the bill.
Making matters worse for the White House, the bill had virtually no support from health care, insurance, patient advocate and disease groups, and was harshly judged by the Congressional Budget Office. Grass-roots opposition to the bill -- aided by Democrats like Senator Chuck Schumer of New York -- swayed members of Congress in a way rarely seen on Capitol Hill.
At the annual meeting of the American Hospital Association in May, Mr. Schumer, the Senate Democratic leader, urged hospital executives to mobilize their employees in an effort to defeat the bill, which had been approved by the House just a few days earlier.
"You have every right to express your outrage on behalf of the people who you take care of and your employees," Mr. Schumer told hospital leaders. "Everyone needs to speak up and let their elected officials know how bad this bill is."
The final efforts for the bill began to unravel over the weekend as several Republican senators began to balk at the legislation. Although the Trump administration had dispatched Seema Verma, the new administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, to the summer meeting of the National Governors Association in Providence, R.I., to try to persuade governors -- and, by extension, the senators in their states -- of the bill's merits, the governors remained unmoved.
By Saturday night, aides to Senator John McCain of Arizona, who is recovering from surgery, announced that he was unable to return from Phoenix this week, leaving Republican leaders another vote short.
By Monday night, as Mr. Trump was meeting with the group of Republican senators at the White House -- not one of whom was on the fence about the bill -- Mr. Moran and Mr. Lee, two senators who were on the fence, issued statements saying they would not support it, a catastrophe for the White House.
Late Monday, Mr. McConnell responded by vowing to pass a measure to repeal the Affordable Care Act now, then work on a replacement over the next two years. But on Tuesday, three Republican senators -- Ms. Collins, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska -- told Mr. McConnell they would not support his last-ditch effort.
Ms. Capito has generally been an ally of Republican leaders on even really tough votes and once told colleagues that the nearly 180,000 people on Medicaid in her state outnumbered the total number of people who had voted for her.
On Tuesday in Kansas, citizen-activists like Courtney Eiterich, 42, of Lenexa, who has multiple sclerosis, were celebrating outside Mr. Moran's office in Olathe. "I've never done this level of political activism before," said Ms. Eiterich, who had been dogging Mr. Moran for months. "But if I'm not speaking out, who's going to do it?"
Mr. Kasich, who had been against the bill, was pleased with the outcome on Tuesday, and recalled conversations he had with Mr. Portman.
"I told him all the time, this is not just about opiates, though opiates are a big part of it," Mr. Kasich said. "It's also about people who suffer mental illness or chronic illness. Rob was trying to figure out how to be constructive, but at the same time, he didn't want to be taken for granted in terms of his vote."
Patient advocates, who had major concerns about the bill, were relieved.
"We joined together in January over a plate of breakfast burritos, so we call ourselves the burrito coalition," said Sue Nelson, a vice president of the American Heart Association. "We wrote letters, we brought in patients, we talked to congressional staff until we were blue in the face. We provided members of Congress with hundreds and thousands of stories from patients to let them know how critical it was to preserve affordable health care for their constituents."
Now what Mr. Trump once described as "an easy" process appears destined to stall his policy agenda, and has damaged his diminished standing on Capitol Hill.
Still, the White House is not giving up. Late on Tuesday, Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, announced that Mr. Trump was inviting all Republican senators to the White House on Wednesday -- to talk about health care.

Full text: CARACAS, Venezuela -- Millions of Venezuelans signaled their disapproval of President Nicolás Maduro's plan to hold a constituent assembly by casting ballots on Sunday in a vote unlike any other in this nation's history. More than 98 percent of voters sided with the opposition in answering three yes-or-no questions drafted with the aim of weakening Mr. Maduro's legitimacy days before his constituent assembly is expected to convene. Opponents see the assembly as a power grab by an increasingly unpopular leader and fear he may use it to do away with democratic elections.
Sunday's exercise, known as a popular consultation, was organized by a slate of opposition parties that dominate Venezuela's National Assembly.
Organizers had hoped that a large turnout and a lopsided result would widen rifts within the governing party and deepen the government's international isolation, undermining Mr. Maduro's plan to appoint an assembly of handpicked supporters to draft a new Constitution.
Shortly before midnight, a group of Venezuelan university administrators tasked with overseeing the vote count said that more than 7,186,000 ballots had been cast. Organizers hailed the outcome and the turnout.
"This country demonstrated once again that it conquers its aspirations through the vote," Cecilia García Arocha, the head of the Central University of Venezuela, said as she announced the results.
"This fight was born on the street and today it continues and will continue to be waged on the streets until we restore democracy and liberty," Leopoldo López, an opposition leader released from prison and placed under house arrest last weekend, said on Twitter. "Today millions decide and establish a mandate. No one should doubt that it is binding and that we must defend it and ensure it is heeded."
Voters were asked whether they rejected the effort to hold a constituent assembly that has not been approved by voters; whether they wanted the country's armed forces to uphold the current Constitution and the decisions of the opposition-run National Assembly; and whether they wanted free elections to pick a new "national unity government."
The Venezuelan Constitution passed under Mr. Maduro's predecessor, Hugo Chávez, in 1999 includes a provision authorizing popular consultations as a means of safeguarding "people's exercise of their sovereignty." Venezuela's election commission did not play a role in Sunday's vote, which was run by volunteers. The opposition, citing the Constitution, says the vote is binding, but the government dismisses it as illegitimate.
While Mr. Maduro is widely expected to ignore the outcome, organizers hope that it invigorates a protest movement that has gained momentum over the past couple of months. Tensions have soared across Venezuela amid widespread food and medicine shortages and spiraling inflation that the government routinely plays down.
For ordinary Venezuelans, Sunday's vote was the first opportunity to cast ballots since the 2015 legislative election that ended the United Socialist Party's dominance of the National Assembly. The government has postponed every election that was scheduled to take place since then.
While the vote unfolded smoothly in most cities, there were scattered reports of violence and intimidation, including the killing of a 61-year-old woman on the outskirts of Caracas, the capital, during an attack by gunmen near a voting site. The attorney general's office identified the woman, a nurse, as Xiomara Escot.
Voters waited in line for hours to slip ballots printed on simple paper into old cardboard boxes that bore logos of items such as toilet paper and doughnuts.
Daniela Ramos, 64, a homemaker in Caracas, said she was voting with a heavy heart. One of her daughters, a mother of two, was killed during a robbery. The killing prompted her other daughter to move to the United States. "I vote so my daughter can come back," she said. "I vote for my slain daughter."
Rainiero Paz, 39, said he was stunned by the turnout. "This exceeded our expectations; I haven't even seen this during presidential elections," said Mr. Paz, who recently lost his job at a warehouse after Mr. Maduro ordered wage increases.
While opponents of the government lined up to vote, Maduro loyalists held a "drill" for the constituent assembly, calling on supporters to participate in a mock voting exercise that was covered widely on state-run news outlets. The turnout for that was notably thin.
Attorney General Luisa Ortega, who recently broke ranks with Mr. Maduro and has criticized his plan to convene a constituent assembly as undemocratic, stopped by an opposition-run voting station. As she greeted voters, one told her, "Welcome to freedom."
Ms. Ortega's husband, a lawmaker from Mr. Maduro's United Socialist Party, cast a ballot responding only to the first question.
Abroad, opposition leaders set up dozens of polling stations in cities with large communities of Venezuelan expatriates. In Rio de Janeiro, voters lined up at a park next to a large banner that said "S.O.S. Venezuela."
"Our best weapon is this: our vote," said María Carolina Ceballos, 31, who had a Venezuelan flag wrapped around her shoulders. "We reject violence and we will continue to defend Venezuela always through democratic means."

Full text: Under fire for skyrocketing drug prices, pharmaceutical companies often offer this response: The high costs of their products are justified because the proceeds generate money for crucial research on new cures and treatments. It's a compelling argument, but only partly true. As a revealing new academic study shows, big pharmaceutical companies have spent more on share buybacks and dividends in a recent 10-year period than they did on research and development. The working paper, published on Thursday by the Institute for New Economic Thinking, is entitled "U.S. Pharma's Financialized Business Model."
The paper's five authors concluded that from 2006 through 2015, the 18 drug companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 index spent a combined $516 billion on buybacks and dividends. This exceeded by 11 percent the companies' research and development spending of $465 billion during these years.
The authors contend that many big pharmaceutical companies are living off patents that are decades-old and have little to show in the way of new blockbuster drugs. But their share buybacks and dividend payments inoculate them against shareholders who might be concerned about lackluster research and development.
A few companies have spent more money repurchasing shares than they allocated to research over the period, the study found. They included Gilead Sciences, which spent $27 billion on buybacks versus $17 billion on research, and Biogen Idec, which repurchased $14.6 billion in stock and spent $13.8 billion on research and development.
"The key cause of high drug prices, restricted access to medicines and stifled innovation, we submit, is a social disease called 'maximizing shareholder value,"' the study's authors concluded.
This concept, the authors said, is actually "an ideology of value extraction." And chief among the beneficiaries of the extraction are drug company executives, whose pay packages, based in part on stock prices, are among the lushest in corporate America.
"There's no shortage of spending on R&D in the U.S. economy, and no shortage of spending on life sciences, even though it has declined somewhat in real terms," one of the authors, William Lazonick, a professor of economics at the University of Massachusetts, Lowell, said in an interview. "But there really is very little drug development going on in companies showing the highest profits and capturing much of the gains."
(The other authors are: Matt Hopkins, Ken Jacobson, Mustafa Erdem Sakinç and Öner Tulum, all researchers at the Academic-Industry Research Network, a nonprofit organization.)
While stock buybacks appear to be particularly troublesome among drugmakers, big companies in other industries -- in sectors like banking, retail, technology and consumer goods, among others -- are also buying back boatloads of their shares. Through May, some $390 billion in buybacks have been announced this year, $13 billion more than at this time in 2016, according to figures compiled by Jeffrey Yale Rubin at Birinyi Associates, a stock market research firm.
June 28 was the biggest single buyback announcement day in history. That was when 26 banks disclosed buybacks worth $92.8 billion, largely a response to having just passed the stress tests administered by the Federal Reserve Board. That figure blew past the previous record of $56.4 billion announced on July 20, 2006.
Many companies contend that stock buybacks are a great way to return value to their shareholders. Investors often agree. By reducing the equity outstanding at a company, the repurchases increase its per-share earnings, often giving a boost to its stock.
Buybacks made at low cost can be a fine use of a company's capital. But when share repurchases replace a company's research-and-development spending, that indicates its management is unable or unwilling to spend on innovation that could generate future earnings to shareholders.
As the buyback binge continues, another new academic study shows, a heavy reliance on them actually hurts corporate performance over the long haul. These researchers found that the more capital a business invests in stock repurchases based on its current market capitalization, "the less likely that company is to experience long-term growth in overall market value."
"Secular Stagnation" is by Robert U. Ayres, emeritus professor of economics, political science and technology management at the global business school Insead, and Michael Olenick, a research fellow there. It compares the performance of companies that lean heavily on buybacks with those that do not.
Spending money on buybacks and dividends has increased among United States companies from negligible levels in the 1980s, the researchers said, to 38 percent of earnings in 2000. By 2011, buybacks had grown to 79 percent of earnings, rocketing to 110 percent in 2015.
The research looked at 1,839 large company buybacks from January 1990 through last month, examining 6,516 inflation-adjusted transactions. The academics then examined the amounts these companies had spent on repurchases compared with their current market capitalizations.
Mr. Ayres and Mr. Olenick found that 199 companies repurchased shares equal to at least half their current value. Some 64 companies spent over 100 percent of their current market capitalization on buybacks.
When the academics combined these companies' current market values with the amounts they had spent on buybacks, the sum showed what the companies should have been worth if they had invested the money in a money-market account instead.
Fifty companies have spent more inflation-adjusted capital buying back stock than their businesses are currently worth in market value, the study found. Companies on this list include HP Inc., J. C. Penney and Sears Holdings.
By contrast, the research identified 269 strong performers that have repurchased stock worth just 2 percent or less of their current market values. They include Facebook, Xcel Energy, Berkshire Hathaway and Amazon.
Company executives who buy back large numbers of shares instead of investing in their businesses are committing corporate suicide, Mr. Olenick said. "When managers can't create value in the business other than buying their own stock," he said in an interview, "it seems like it's time for a management change."
His co-author, Mr. Ayres, said he suspected the buyback craze was rooted in executives' laser focus on short-term results. "They have short-term expectations," he said in an interview. "They're in their jobs for a few years at most; they're not really interested in the long-term future of the company."
Share buybacks provide immediate gratification, the stock market equivalent of a sugar high. That makes them alluring in the short term. Until the crash that usually follows.

Full text: Making a case that the stock market isn't expensive these days often means dragging Tina into the conversation. Tina is short for "There is no alternative." It is a claim that after a decade of loose monetary policy and low interest rates, bonds, the traditional alternative to stocks, are no better a bargain than high-flying stocks.
Yet there may be one alternative to stocks. Commodities got cheaper through much of the second quarter, adding to several years of mediocre-to-weak performance. Gold and silver were hit hard. So were materials that work for a living, such as iron ore, copper, oil (and substances refined from it), although some of them staged rebounds late in the period, as did many agricultural products.
Ordinary investors can take positions in commodities through funds that hold them directly or that own shares of companies that mine, grow or process them. But should they? Prices have tumbled, but have they tumbled enough?
Investment advisers are divided on whether commodities are on the verge of reversing their poor performance, compared with stocks, and some who do think so aren't especially enthusiastic about it. There is wider agreement that commodities or shares of production companies are worth owning for the sake of broadening a portfolio and reducing risk.
"The stock market as a whole looks expensive to us," said Matt Kadnar, an asset allocation specialist for GMO, "but commodity stocks look like they're trading at a bit of a discount, relative to where they have traded historically, and there's a diversification benefit."
"Having some element of your portfolio in commodity-based equities makes sense," he said, "but it's much harder to call them a strong buy, as you could have 15 months ago when they were being taken to the cleaners." That was around the time crude oil was trading at multiyear lows, in the mid-$20s a barrel, roughly half of where it is now. Agricultural products and industrial and precious metals were also near long-term bottoms.
Krishna Memani, chief investment officer of OppenheimerFunds, agrees that commodity producers' stocks would have been a better buy then, but he still thinks they are worthwhile now and likely to perform well in the second half as evidence mounts of a broadening global economic recovery.
"As commodities have gone out of vogue, commodity-oriented companies are probably cheap, although I would have said that with a lot more conviction in the first quarter of 2016," Mr. Memani said. "As the synchronized global growth picture persists, the discount may disappear."
One reason that Mr. Kadnar thinks shares of production companies have recovered less than they should have is that there is a bias against them that actually creates long-term value.
"One of the things we like about commodity equities is that managers tend to avoid them," he said.
Mr. Kadnar was hinting at a shortcoming inherent in investing in commodities: There are no correct fundamental prices for them. Yardsticks like price-earnings ratios exist to indicate whether stocks are reasonably valued, but commodities typically move, often with violent swings, in response to ephemeral and often unpredictable economic, industrial and even meteorological events.
Investors can work around those difficulties, said Scott E. Wolle, chief investment officer for global asset allocation at Invesco, by comparing recent prices with their very long-term averages (most commodities are trading well below their average prices over the last 10 years, he noted) and choosing exposure to a broad range of markets, seeking diversification into and within commodities.
"That's a long-term measure of value that should put you on the right side of the trade," he said.
Exchange-traded funds with a diversified range of physical commodities include iShares S&P GSCI Commodity-Indexed Trust, PowerShares DB Commodity Index Tracking Fund and United States Commodity Index Fund. The first two are heavily weighted toward energy commodities; the third has equal allocations of 14 commodities.
E.T.F.s for production-company stocks generally focus on narrower segments, like SPDR S&P Metals & Mining, FlexShares Morningstar Global Upstream Natural Resources Index Fund and VanEck Vectors Agribusiness.
Commodities are useful in hedging against inflation, Mr. Wolle said. He acknowledged that inflation has been subdued worldwide for many years and that commodity prices have suffered for it, but they remain "one of the few assets that can protect you against that."
Certain commodities, most notably gold, also serve as hedges against political uncertainty and upheaval, Mr. Wolle said. There certainly has been some of that in the last several months, and gold has rallied about 20 percent from its low in late 2015.
With global monetary policy still loose, he recommends exposure to precious metals to guard against any uptick in inflation. The immediate outlook is also auspicious for industrial metals and energy, in his view, as economic growth picks up in more parts of the world, though he advises steering clear of agricultural commodities.
As for how to get exposure, Mr. Wolle favors the materials themselves, or funds that own them directly, rather than commodity stocks. Some companies hedge their own exposure by using derivative contracts that lock in a specific price for what they produce, limiting the benefit of rising prices, he pointed out.
The Wells Fargo Investment Institute, by contrast, favors a none-of-the-above approach when it comes to short-term allocations to commodities. It has been bearish since the start of the year and predicts weakness into 2018, in line with its bullish outlook on the dollar, which tends to move in the opposite direction from commodities.
But John LaForge, head of real asset strategy at the institute, conceded in a recent report that "the U.S. dollar could make us wrong should it become unexpectedly, excessively weak." Noting that gold, an alternative currency for thousands of years, is more sensitive to movements in the dollar than other commodities, he added, "Gold is where we could be really wrong."
Even if commodities bounce back, they may not bounce that high, Mr. Memani of OppenheimerFunds cautioned.
"Commodities are probably in a good place, relative to the supply/demand dynamic," but that "doesn't mean prices are going back to the old highs" achieved around six years ago.
"People imputed special value to commodities based on the growth spurt from 2000 to 2007 driven by an investment and construction boom in emerging markets, and China in particular," he said. "As that demand accelerated in a meaningful way, it helped prices, but that in turn brought in new supply and depressed prices. Unless we get a new boom, the chance of prices going back to that level is pretty small."
It's clear that commodities cost a lot less than they did several years ago and that stocks cost a lot more. But given the variety of opinions about commodities, it's less clear they are the best of the alternatives that value-conscious investors look for, even if the others aren't so great, either. So investors should be careful when considering what, how and why to buy.
"With commodities, like anything else, there are no easy answers," Mr. Kadnar said.

Full text: The labor market is stumping even the experts. The unemployment rate is near a 16-year low, and employers are fretting about their inability to find reliable workers. That shortage of workers should prompt an increase in wages. Remember that supply and demand curve: When the demand (for workers) exceeds the supply, prices should rise. Yet wages have stubbornly resisted the pressure. As Janet L. Yellen, chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, noted in congressional testimony this week, the relationship between a tight labor market and wage pressure "has become more attenuated than we've been accustomed to historically."
So why don't employers offer more? That was a common question readers posed after an article last week about the government's monthly jobs report quoted Sarah M. Smith, an owner of Rooforia Home Exteriors in Omaha. Ms. Smith depends on a federal program that gives temporary visas to guest workers -- known as H-2B visas -- because she is unable to find Americans to take a seasonal job repairing roofs that pays $17 an hour. The work is tough, she said, but "the pay is fair."
Many people -- including some economists -- disagreed. By definition, they argued, if no one is willing to work for that wage, then the wage is too low. Others complained that allowing in guest workers pushes down the wages that American workers can get. (Employers have to advertise on a state website of job listings and at least twice in a local newspaper before they can apply to hire foreign workers on H-2B visas.)
Ms. Smith's viewpoint, however, is echoed by thousands of employers, large and small, throughout the country. We asked this small-business owner to explain the financial constraints she confronts. Her answers shed some light on why wages are not going up. One reason is that while people want higher wages, they don't want to pay higher prices. Average hourly wages have increased only 2.5 percent since last year, but prices of most goods and services have not risen much either. Year-over-year inflation is under 2 percent.
Ms. Smith's responses have been edited and condensed.
How much does it cost to repair a roof in Omaha?
Residential roofing jobs vary so much based on different factors, including the size, how high it is, how steep it is, the materials being installed. I would say, just by guessing, that our average roof replacement costs about $8,000. Usually we try to aim for 40 percent profit margin. A couple thousand for labor; the rest for materials, sales commission, taxes, insurance and overhead.
How did you arrive at the $17-an-hour rate?
We have offered the $17-an-hour wage because it is the prevailing wage determination for this type of work, according to the United States Department of Labor. We do offer incentives and bonuses above that. And just to note, Nebraska's minimum wage is $9 an hour.
If you can't get workers at $17 an hour, why don't you offer higher pay?
In response to the article, I got an email that said if we were to offer $35 an hour with health care benefits, we would definitely get people to apply; it said people who were highly qualified applicants with years of experience would probably line up at our door.
My response is: We would love to be able to offer $35 an hour as starting pay, but are you in turn willing to pay premium prices for your next roof replacement? A lot of customers we get through online lead services like Thumbtack are people looking for the best deal. They want to collect proposals from four to five businesses and most of the time choose the cheapest one.
We want to compensate our employees fairly for the work they do and the risk they take, but we wouldn't be able to stay in business if we doubled the hourly rate. It's not just their hourly wage that becomes a factor. Insurance in the roofing industry is extremely expensive. Not only are we required to carry expensive general liability insurance, we also have to have workers' compensation insurance for employees on the roof. That comes to 40 percent of their wage. And on top of that, there's payroll tax.
We also do a lot of insurance restoration work like hail damage claims, and in those cases the insurance provider determines what they pay for labor and we work with it. If we come back saying it's going to cost us way more on labor to do the job, the homeowner isn't likely to want to cover the extra cost, especially not above their out-of-pocket deductible.
What do you think would happen if you did raise your prices to pay your workers more?
At the end of the day, if I were to say, "We're a great company; we pay people double the prevailing wage, pay our insurance and taxes, buy the best materials for your house, and we give back to our community (we donate a percentage of our profits to our raise-a-roof initiative to donate roofs to families in need), but that means we're going to charge you double for your roof," I'm sure people (like the emailer) aren't going to say: "Oh, that's so great they pay their employees $35 an hour. Let's write them a check for twice as much as their competitor because it makes us feel good!" They're going to do what's best for their bank account and their budget.
If you want to have lower-wage people paid more, you have to expect the price of the services to cost more; it's not going to just come out of nowhere. That's where the literal buck stops because no one wants to pay more of their hard-earned dollars. We still want to make a profit and not risk losing business because of increased prices.
Lastly, I would be willing to make a large bet that even if we did post a job for $35 an hour to do roofing in Omaha (it was 92 degrees this week), it would still be slim pickings. That's why for us the H-2B program is a win-win: We get great workers whom we pay well above the minimum wage, and they are low-risk temporary immigrants who come here to do the job and go home to their families at the end of the season.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text: Gains by big technology and health care companies pushed stocks modestly higher on Friday, lifting several major indexes to new highs. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, the Dow Jones industrial average and the Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks each set records as the market posted its third straight day of gains.
Energy companies helped lift the market as crude oil prices rose. High-dividend stocks like real estate companies and utilities also posted big gains following a drop in bond yields. The lower yields and a weak forecast from JPMorgan Chase weighed on banks.
Investors brushed off a report showing that retail sales declined in June and drew encouragement from data indicating that industrial production rebounded last month. Traders also welcomed a report showing that inflation at the consumer level was flat in June, which suggests that the Federal Reserve may have more reason to delay another interest rate increase.
Lindsey Bell, an investment strategist at CFRA Research, said, "The low inflation data will put the Fed more in a wait-and-see mode to really determine if the low inflationary environment is really transitory."
The S.&P. 500 index gained 11.44 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,459.27. The Dow rose 84.65 points, or 0.4 percent, to 21,637.74. The Nasdaq composite added 38.03 points, or 0.6 percent, to 6,312.47. The Russell 2000 index picked up 3.16 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,428.82.
Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.33 percent from 2.35 percent late Thursday.
Investors had a mix of company earnings and economic data to consider Friday.
The Commerce Department said retail sales fell 0.2 percent in June as Americans curtailed spending at restaurants, department stores and gas stations. That followed a 0.1 percent drop in May. In addition, the Federal Reserve said factory output rebounded in June as manufacturers churned out more cars, appliances and furniture. Overall industrial production rose 0.4 percent and is up 2 percent over the last year.
And the Labor Department said consumer prices were flat in June, the latest evidence that inflation remains muted. All told, inflation has climbed just 1.6 percent from a year ago.
Several big banks reported their second-quarter earnings on Friday. Among them were JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo, each of which posted results that beat Wall Street's expectations. But it was not all good news.
JPMorgan, the nation's largest bank by assets, said it expected weaker net interest income. Its shares fell 85 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $92.25, while Citigroup slid 30 cents to $66.72. Wells Fargo lost 61 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $54.99.
Technology and health care companies were among the big gainers. NetApp climbed 2.26, or 5.5 percent, to $43.64. Microsoft rose $1.01, or 1.1 percent, to $72.78. Zimmer Biomet Holdings gained $3.51, or 2.7 percent, to $132.49.
Despite the decline in retail sales in June, investors bid up shares in several retail chains after some analysts upgraded the sector a day after Target raised its second-quarter forecasts and said sales and customer traffic increased. Ulta Beauty gained $4.34, or 1.7 percent, to $261.74, while Gap rose 50 cents, or 2.2 percent, to $23.28.
Energy futures closed higher. Benchmark United States crude rose 46 cents, or 1 percent, to settle at $46.54 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, used to price international oils, gained 49 cents, or 1 percent, to $48.91 per barrel in London.
The dollar fell sharply, sliding to 112.56 yen from 113.23 yen late Thursday. The dollar also weakened against the euro, which rose to $1.1467 from $1.1406.

Full text: Technology companies led stocks higher on Wednesday in a broad rally that helped nudge the Dow Jones industrial average to a new peak. In remarks before Congress, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, raised the possibility that the central bank would consider slowing the pace of its interest rate increases if inflation remained persistently below its target level.
The move assuaged concerns among some traders who have been worried that the Fed was moving too quickly to raise interest rates, despite a slowdown in inflation and the economy's sluggish growth of just 1.4 percent in the first quarter.
Ms. Yellen's remarks put investors in a buying mood and sent bond yields lower, stoking demand for real estate companies, utilities and other high-dividend stocks. Materials companies also posted hefty gains.
"Investors would prefer lower interest rates, particularly if the economy isn't gaining the kind of traction that would warrant a faster rate-hike path," said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. "This is positive for the markets."
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 17.72 points, or 0.7 percent, to 2,443.25. The Dow rose 123.07 points, or 0.6 percent, to 21,532.14, a record high. The Nasdaq composite added 67.87 points, or 1.1 percent, to 6,261.17.
The stock market appeared to be poised for a big move early, climbing in premarket trading as investors sized up Ms. Yellen's prepared remarks, which were released before her testimony. The indexes opened higher across the board and stayed up the rest of the day.
Ms. Yellen, in her biannual testimony before the House Financial Services Committee, said the central bank expected to keep increasing a key interest rate at a gradual pace, but also raised the possibility that the pace of increases would be slower than previously expected if inflations remain below its annual growth target of 2 percent.
Many economists believe the Fed, which has raised rates three times since December, will increase rates once more this year.
Ms. Yellen also said she planned to start trimming the Fed's bond holdings this year.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.32 percent from 2.37 percent Tuesday afternoon. Yields affect rates on mortgages and other consumer loans.
Technology companies led the market higher. PayPal gained $1.79, or 3.3 percent, to $56.55. Nvidia rose $6.63, or 4.3 percent, to $162.51. Activision Blizzard added $3.04, or 5.2 percent, to $61.02.
Real estate investment trusts and other stocks that pay high dividends benefited from rising bond prices, which pulled bond yields lower. Crown Castle International rose $1.76, or 1.8 percent, to $100.05. American Tower climbed $2.95, or 2.3 percent, to $133.88.
NRG Energy was the biggest gainer in the S.&P. 500. It soared 29.4 percent after the company said it planned to raise up to $4 billion through asset sales in order to lower its debt. The stock climbed $4.79 to $21.09.
Oil prices wavered early Wednesday, but recovered following a report showing that United States crude oil inventories declined sharply last week.
Benchmark United States crude rose 45 cents, or 1 percent, to settle at $45.49 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, which is used to price international oils, gained 20 cents, or 0.4 percent, to close at $47.72 per barrel in London.
The dollar fell to 113.25 yen from 113.84 yen late Tuesday. The euro fell to $1.1416 from $1.1467.
Gold rose $4.40 to $1,219.10 an ounce. Silver added 14 cents to $15.89 an ounce. Copper inched up 1 cent to $2.68 a pound.

Full text: Only in Trumpland can Gary D. Cohn be considered a suitable Federal Reserve chairman. Mr. Cohn, the former Goldman Sachs president who is a current White House adviser, is said to be the leading contender to replace Janet L. Yellen, according to Politico. Though not a trained economist, Mr. Cohn's years in finance put him ahead of President Trump's other cabinet picks who notably lack relevant résumés. But a Wall Street trader's temperament makes a bad match for the staid central-bank job.
The registered New York Democrat did not have a government background when he became director of the National Economic Council. Still, he had honed his finance skills during more than 25 years at Goldman, and he quickly hired White House staff members with complementary experience. His operation contrasted with those of cabinet members like Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who struggled to answer basic questions about school curriculums in her confirmation hearing.
Choosing Mr. Cohn as head of the central bank would be an unconventional pick. Over the last 40 years, Fed chiefs have been economists and have also served at least two four-year terms. Ms. Yellen will have served only one if Mr. Trump does not renominate her. The last one-term, noneconomist Fed chairman was G. William Miller, who had been the chief executive of Textron before President Jimmy Carter tapped him. At a time of high inflation, his policies tanked the dollar and he lasted just over a year.
Mr. Cohn spent much of his time at Goldman as a trader. He joined its J. Aron commodities unit and became the head of the divisions for fixed income, equities and global securities before he became the company's president. Goldman is known as the most alpha of the investment banks, and the hard-charging job fit Mr. Cohn's personality.
Running the central bank is a more sedate affair. The staff consists of number crunchers with doctorates in economics who pore over various models to analyze growth and employment. News conferences after meetings by the interest-rate-setting committee are carefully scripted. Ms. Yellen, like her forebears, chooses her words carefully, knowing any hint of surprise can rattle markets.
Her predecessor, Ben Bernanke, learned that in 2013, when he said the central bank would no longer be purchasing bonds, causing United States Treasury yields to surge in what became known as the "taper tantrum." Mr. Cohn, a blunt talker, may find such restrictions suffocating. Markets will prefer a more boring choice.
